29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,110

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,380
what's that one thing you can't have

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,789

ready one two three better sign a

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,740
cybersecurity right yeah that's that's

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,020
what we're here for

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,329
I heard it I heard some of you said

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,280
information security

37
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,789
I said cybersecurity yeah I did and you

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,860
know what I like it I do I like it you

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,200
know why because I used to have to say

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,090
Oh what do you do I do network security

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,250
and hardware security and information

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,500
security and now I just say cyber

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,920
security and it's everything all at once

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,869
and and everybody says oh I hate the

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,819
cyber word I hate it but you know what I

46
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,980
hate more having to explain to people

47
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,320
what I do using all those other word

48
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,090
so now I just say cybersecurity and they

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,680
picture me as that guy on TV who's

50
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,850
crawling through air ducts and that's

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,670
okay yeah so you guys all said better

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,489
cybersecurity I may be maybe that one

53
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,429
lady back there didn't but she I think

54
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,620
she was just daydreaming that's what we

55
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,060
all want and what we're gonna talk about

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,460
today is why you can't have it okay so

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,770
moving on let me tell you a little story

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,300
I look at that cup of joe it's the best

59
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,780
conference see it's getting better all

60
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,140
the time

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,750
thank you let me tell you a little story

62
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,609
maybe you've heard this before a story

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,410
called the frog and the scorpion so

64
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,570
basically the Scorpion he wants to get

65
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,460
across the river but he can't because

66
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,650
you know scorpions don't swim so good

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,590
so anyways scorpion can't get across the

68
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,970
river so he puts an ad out he says he

69
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,630
wants to hire a frog to get him across

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,000
the river

71
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,590
frog shows up all eager hey man I can

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,810
get you across the river scorpion climbs

73
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,880
on his back stabs and kills him before

74
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,400
they even get to the river

75
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,140
so scorpions like fine

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,240
I need another frog who can get me

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,429
across the river three more shot frogs

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,100
show up all of them one resume better

79
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,610
than the next all of them very eager to

80
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,370
get that scorpion across the river and

81
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,260
each one one at a time but before before

82
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,930
the scorpions even ankle-deep in the

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,959
river all three frogs are dead more

84
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,520
frogs show up all of them I'll take you

85
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,990
across the river I can do it those guys

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,709
sucked I can get you across the river

87
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,840
better scorpion grabs on them rides

88
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,970
sting sting sting all dead

89
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,760
eventually last one dead no more frog

90
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:59,400
show up scorpion sinks into the water

91
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,590
dies now this was an MBA program and not

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,830
a security conference you'd be sitting

93
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,780
there thinking those frogs sucked they

94
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,940
didn't do their jobs

95
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,830
you know they had one job one job get

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,550
the Scorpion across the river and they

97
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:21,000
couldn't do that they failed at their

98
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:21,900
job but you your security people and

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,690
you're sitting there and you're thinking

100
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,690
holy crap they're all scorpions

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,669
and that's really who we work for we

102
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,050
work for scorpions and that's what I

103
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,198
want to talk to you about today how do

104
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,569
you survive that how do you how do you

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,009
live in a world and work in a world

106
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:43,690
where they're all scorpions well I don't

107
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,520
think it's news to any of you that

108
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,509
cybersecurity professionals are mostly

109
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,020
an unhappy bunch on a sadder note we we

110
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:56,620
have a huge rate of depression actual

111
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,539
clinical depression in our field for

112
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,780
those who aren't clinically depressed we

113
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:07,719
have stress back we have overeating we

114
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:09,909
have drinking we have you know the basic

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,120
relationship problems and probably

116
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,530
getting fired right that's that's that's

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,620
pretty much what we can look forward to

118
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:21,818
yeah so we have good reason for not

119
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,380
being for not being happy and the thing

120
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,789
is is that it's happening to all of you

121
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,349
so if any of you actually thought you

122
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:28,690
were unique and you're happy about that

123
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:36,009
well you're not so continue being

124
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:37,900
miserable okay so basically we all got

125
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,310
into cyber security because we love it

126
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,080
we can't think of doing anything else

127
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,909
I'm not I'm not I'm not crapping on

128
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,830
cyber security here I love it I couldn't

129
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,500
do anything else and I have to tell you

130
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,669
if you got into cyber security mainly

131
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,830
because you like hanging out with

132
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,740
middle-aged white guys with big egos

133
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,380
and like to humble brag a lot then

134
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:01,599
you're in for a treat but you don't

135
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:03,880
deserve one though okay basically if

136
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,969
cyber security were an animal it would

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,219
be a raccoon guarding the garbage can

138
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,020
that it eats out of while washing its

139
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,650
hands it's little tiny hands in the

140
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,219
stream

141
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,289
thinking it's dignified okay that's

142
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:19,719
where at how many of you are hating me

143
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,400
now you know who's hating me the ones

144
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:25,569
who haven't done this long enough that's

145
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,690
what I think I'm just trying to make

146
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,900
little humor here okay the thing is is

147
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,880
that our big thing is that cyber

148
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,349
security needs to learn the language of

149
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,449
business how many people have heard that

150
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,699
if we can't talk business we're screwed

151
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,600
right every book every cybersecurity

152
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,340
book

153
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,380
information security but wherever you

154
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,179
get blog posts they're all telling you

155
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,159
learn the language of business learn how

156
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,750
to talk about risk risk with the big are

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,150
risk with the little are learn how to

158
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,010
calculated tell us the money show us how

159
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,320
much we need how much effort man-hours

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:01,360
you know start go get your MBA degree

161
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:05,219
talk to us like business you know but

162
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,780
really they need us to okay

163
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,370
and nobody's going out and telling them

164
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,539
I haven't seen any business blogs going

165
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,210
oh you should learn the language of

166
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,540
cybersecurity that's not happening

167
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,400
I I've taught an MBA program and and

168
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,160
they called it Business Information

169
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,919
Security and it was one of the least

170
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,610
popular electives but I'm not doing it

171
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,320
anymore but the truth is is that yeah

172
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,210
nobody's telling them that they need to

173
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,680
learn cybersecurity which is strange

174
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,020
because they all teaching them about

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,040
accounting fraud and all sorts of bad

176
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,930
things yeah so so that security is

177
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,750
definitely on the plate for them just

178
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,180
not cybersecurity so I mean there's

179
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,860
definitely a codependency here but

180
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,040
they're kind of doing their own thing

181
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,690
and and we're kind of being abused the

182
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,460
thing is is that companies are not gonna

183
00:07:52,690 --> 00:08:00,520
change since the 70s look at environment

184
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,280
right so we've had all sorts of business

185
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,060
knows that they can abuse things to make

186
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,950
money you know so since the 70s we've

187
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,520
seen this with environmental protection

188
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,780
acts you know we see fracking reactor

189
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,039
cooling basically energy production any

190
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,830
place where they can Trash the

191
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,680
environment they do thankfully in the

192
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,229
90s it no it hasn't stopped yeah it's

193
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,480
still going they're still losing getting

194
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,030
fined occasionally and yeah the

195
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,950
environment still crap so don't think

196
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,380
that information security or cyber

197
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,469
security since but since the 90s

198
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,169
thousands 2000 since we've I mean if

199
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,900
environment hasn't improved through a

200
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,340
business and business you can't tell me

201
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,689
the last 50 years business hasn't

202
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,220
learned that trashing the environments

203
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,370
not necessarily good for the environment

204
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,050
it is good for business apparently that

205
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,220
they're gonna learn this same thing with

206
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,290
cybersecurity just

207
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,759
because we go and we tell them oh you

208
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,199
need cybersecurity or you're gonna lose

209
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,420
money or you're gonna lose people's

210
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:04,660
identities that's not gonna happen yeah

211
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,569
companies are not going to change and we

212
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,009
have proof we've seen it we've seen all

213
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,910
sorts of things that they haven't

214
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,389
changed

215
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,569
I was pretty downer for this morning huh

216
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:19,029
I bet you're glad you came here now the

217
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,620
thing is truth and I'm sorry that I have

218
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,319
to tell you the truth it's not a Disney

219
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,879
movie okay you're you're you're not just

220
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:27,189
a bunch of rascally kids you're gonna

221
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,480
give the comeuppance to the board you

222
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:31,660
know you're not gonna you're not gonna

223
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,019
show them the way and they all get there

224
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,730
and what's coming to them go to jail the

225
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,589
company fails and the CEO steps and

226
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,050
 on the way home you know it's

227
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,720
it's not a Disney movie nothing's gonna

228
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,699
happen at worst they'll take a little

229
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,410
hit the security guy will get fired okay

230
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,969
and then in within a year stock price

231
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,620
will be right back with projected

232
00:09:51,970 --> 00:10:02,439
earnings yeah it sucks

233
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:05,170
it sucks okay so keep in mind

234
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:10,410
cybersecurity is a cost center with a

235
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:14,319
loss motive and no profit incentive yet

236
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:20,500
business needs it they do or they would

237
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:22,569
lose what they have so let's let's take

238
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,879
a moment here and we all read the blogs

239
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:26,729
we all see what's going on we go to a

240
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,809
lot of talks let's not fool ourselves

241
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,009
let's look at ourselves for what we are

242
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:34,509
okay that is who we are

243
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:37,360
there's there's nothing but truth to

244
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:39,399
that and the thing is is that the sooner

245
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,449
you embrace the truth the sooner you see

246
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,720
your place and and again I personally

247
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:47,339
couldn't do anything else and be happy

248
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,040
okay

249
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,889
but a long time ago I've stopped with

250
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,420
the illusion that we can change and that

251
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,180
we can make everything better and we can

252
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,979
all get along instead I just realized

253
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,120
it's a codependent relationship and I

254
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,139
use them as much as they use me and

255
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,630
that's what I'm trying to talk to you

256
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,970
about how do you make life better for

257
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,600
you

258
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:17,420
self okay we need each other they just

259
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:23,389
don't know that yet yeah so the whole

260
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:25,670
idea here is that we recognize this

261
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,560
codependence the way it is okay we know

262
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,509
that they're gonna keep coming out with

263
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,089
dumber and dumber things where they're

264
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:35,269
gonna make money and they're gonna

265
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:38,329
expect us to secure it and that's fine

266
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:40,129
that's fine if you go into it with the

267
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:44,779
attitude that you're gonna use them that

268
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:46,430
they need you okay it's it's not fine if

269
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,040
you go in there like all those happy

270
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,899
frogs and believe me those frogs

271
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,060
they weren't enthusiastic they're like

272
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,600
yeah I'm gonna do this job and I'm gonna

273
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,569
do it good I'm gonna be the best

274
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,509
scorpion carrier there ever was they go

275
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:05,719
in there with best intentions and and

276
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:11,540
that's that's how we do it I mean we

277
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:14,870
like doing this so we do need each other

278
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,550
yeah the thing is is that if we go out

279
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,829
there and we try to sell ourselves if

280
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,050
we're a way to increase profits

281
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:23,000
customers keep our stock price stable if

282
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:27,769
we go out there and we sell that and we

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,279
push that we're lying to ourselves we

284
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:34,819
are a cost center ok those things yes

285
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,069
can we do it to some degree probably for

286
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,899
some markets some places you know but

287
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:44,389
there's easier ways for business to do

288
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:46,220
that than spending money on security so

289
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,939
don't think your way is the way that

290
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,399
makes them the most money it's not they

291
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:56,180
lose more money doing security than then

292
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,209
by actually you know implementing it and

293
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,750
they know that they know that there's

294
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:06,469
easier ways you know I mean the thing is

295
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,420
is that while in this codependent

296
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,279
relationship we're out there and we're

297
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,199
saying the cyber security where we're

298
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,329
trying to sex ourselves up and we're

299
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,459
like hey look at us look at us we get

300
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:18,679
your stock price up look how pretty we

301
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,719
are look what we can do for you but we

302
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,680
really try to sell ourselves to them you

303
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,119
know and

304
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,128
and it's it's not working because

305
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:27,050
they're out there selling their oats and

306
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:30,259
making their money and doing whatever

307
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,029
and ignoring us and we're trying harder

308
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,680
and harder and so what do we do we turn

309
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,240
to complaints we turn to the government

310
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,829
you know it's like it's like it's like

311
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,360
turning to your spouse's parents for

312
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,179
help on getting their attention you know

313
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,129
we go to the government and we say hey

314
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:45,019
make them follow compliance make them do

315
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,290
this and then they'll have to pay

316
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:51,470
attention to us we naively actually

317
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,990
believe that you know we say yeah think

318
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,689
of the children their privacy we need

319
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,779
better privacy laws ha we got GDP our

320
00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:01,939
look what happened you know screw you

321
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,619
guys we have a bunch of people who don't

322
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:06,319
know anything about privacy now tell you

323
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:07,879
about privacy and this is this is the

324
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,589
problem so now you you have this big

325
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,420
document that conflicts itself and

326
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,220
contradicts itself and we have to make

327
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:24,110
that happen until we get fired for it

328
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:24,920
right so it's such a fun talk Oh think

329
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:32,990
of the children

330
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:35,779
yeah we are desperate we're desperate to

331
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,139
get businesses attention and honestly

332
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:40,490
we're not gonna get it some of you maybe

333
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:42,980
you're lucky you work for a company

334
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,499
where you're gonna get it some of you

335
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,139
are in consulting and you see it all the

336
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:52,490
time that it's not really gonna happen

337
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:54,350
you know I I do envy the lucky those of

338
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,920
you who are in a place where where the

339
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,420
company does care and they do value and

340
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,889
they do listen to you and it happens

341
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,920
I've run into them usually they've been

342
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:08,089
breached okay but they they care then

343
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,910
right but but it is desperation on our

344
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:19,249
part you know so let's take a look at

345
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:22,850
this the thing is is that okay as a as

346
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:24,949
an mit-trained mathematician that I

347
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,879
cosplay I like to look at the numbers

348
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:30,920
okay and I look at the numbers and I say

349
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,959
look at this success is when the numbers

350
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,579
go down times caught cheating on your

351
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,969
spouse bonds broken

352
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,459
that's you know episodes of Kardashians

353
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,570
you watch as those numbers go down you

354
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:46,989
can consider that success yeah

355
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:50,120
well it's similar insecurities okay now

356
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,570
allow me to be you know the crowbar of

357
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,279
statistics that hits you in the head but

358
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,730
security control utilizations gone down

359
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,529
from 2017 and 2018 by the way from 40 to

360
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,300
30 percent average number of security

361
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,540
products has gone from four to five

362
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,990
average number of seconds team members

363
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:15,560
has gone from three to two our

364
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:17,029
effectiveness has gone down so you guys

365
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,229
have probably heard there's two million

366
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:23,060
open cyber security jobs or 1.25 or 3.8

367
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,760
or whatever the number happens to be

368
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,319
there's a lot of security jobs out there

369
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,930
most of them aren't called cybersecurity

370
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,570
most of them are just IT that needs some

371
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,029
security okay and the thing is is that

372
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,339
part of the problem is we're facing this

373
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,560
thing where we have really good tools

374
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:41,450
tools are getting better that's for sure

375
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,109
there's no doubt about that tools are

376
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,980
getting better but our effectiveness and

377
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,180
using them is going down so even though

378
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,589
more and more tools are being fought

379
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,689
more and more tools are going out there

380
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,459
there's less people to configure them

381
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,480
properly less people who who can

382
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:02,750
actually work with them right it's it's

383
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,350
a downward trend it's not looking good

384
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:09,230
for us

385
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:12,020
yeah so what ends up happening we put in

386
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,000
more effort those of us who are there

387
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,300
who are in the ditches are putting in

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,059
more effort so technically you can say

389
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,948
that cyber security if we could go out

390
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,418
there to the public and make a you know

391
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,010
public service announcement we would

392
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,130
tell them that their cybersecurity is

393
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:33,590
built on human suffering

394
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:35,780
so maybe Nike will employ us how do we

395
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,178
move forward well see this isn't all

396
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,280
down I been working in this field to

397
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,380
pretty long and I've come to this

398
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,639
realization a long time ago and so I

399
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,010
started working with it and trying to

400
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,150
figure out how we can move ahead how can

401
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,870
we do better

402
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,970
how can I not be like those eager frogs

403
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,169
who gets stung and the thing is is that

404
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,030
I don't think there's any way you can

405
00:17:54,170 --> 00:18:00,410
actually avoid being stung you know

406
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,170
lucky those of you who have never been

407
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:06,590
fired or lost a job or downsized in

408
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:09,680
security you know I've had my share of

409
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:14,120
it and the thing is you have to keep

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:16,940
bouncing back because you know you need

411
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,800
a job but also because you kind of love

412
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,450
it you wouldn't be at a conference like

413
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,500
this if you didn't actually really like

414
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,950
security yeah so let's talk about how

415
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,920
you can fix that

416
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:33,620
all right the main technique that I've

417
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,870
learned on how to address security and

418
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,399
I'm not going to talk about the politics

419
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm not going to talk about I'm talking

420
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,020
about doing your job because once the

421
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,080
politics is all over once all that that

422
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,520
stuff that happened to the boardroom

423
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,560
doesn't matter how much you tried to

424
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,100
fight this mathematically or talk like

425
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,300
business you're all in the same place

426
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,030
because business is out there they're

427
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,460
gonna find the next hot thing just grow

428
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:01,730
up and try to make money on and dump it

429
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:06,410
on you okay so this is what's always

430
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:08,390
worked for me and and you know I do run

431
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,280
a research organization so it's not like

432
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,170
I just pulled it out of somewhere hey

433
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,660
this is something we've actually studied

434
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:20,840
and worked on so first thing I the first

435
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,850
thing I do when I walk into a place and

436
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,550
I know that I have to make sure that

437
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,350
there's security well let me take a

438
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,149
little step back first thing I don't

439
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,639
want to have to do is put out fires all

440
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,440
day who loves that who loves running

441
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,480
around putting out fires somebody's

442
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,000
computers making some noise I want to go

443
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,220
check it out who loves answering the

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,120
phones explaining to people that they

445
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:46,750
have to reboot nope why'd you get in

446
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,120
this job then okay

447
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:53,140
there's always the one you know me but

448
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,870
there was nobody here weird okay

449
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,400
so I don't like doing that so the first

450
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,860
thing I like to do is try to take

451
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,570
control of what I have yeah

452
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,780
my job is to do security so what I'm

453
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,330
gonna do is I'm gonna do my job in a

454
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,850
good way that also covers my ass at the

455
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,189
same time I will probably still get

456
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,049
fired but at least I won't lose your

457
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,460
respect which means I'll find another

458
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:20,299
job pretty quickly because there's like

459
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,460
2 million of them open right so it's

460
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,590
it's like 7-eleven workers you know if I

461
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,179
know how to use this slushie machine man

462
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,860
there's always another 7-eleven across

463
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:32,690
the street so anyways so the whole point

464
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:37,428
here is I go in and the first thing I

465
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,929
try to do is I separate ok now a lot of

466
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,580
people like to go in they say oh we're

467
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,419
gonna patch all the machines and then

468
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,799
we're gonna look for all the

469
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,929
vulnerabilities we're gonna scan for

470
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,780
that no no you're gonna be chasing fires

471
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,360
you start doing that you want to

472
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,690
minimize the amount of mess you have to

473
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,490
deal with so you start separating ok you

474
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,160
want to separate the assets from the

475
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,290
threats physically if possible you want

476
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,410
to shut down ports shut down services

477
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,720
get rid of systems you don't need you

478
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:09,650
want a streamline yeah you want to make

479
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,750
sure that you have physical logical

480
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,309
separations between the assets and a

481
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,660
threat so what I look for is

482
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:18,110
interactions where can they actually

483
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,380
interact with each other that's first

484
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,240
thing I do and I might tell the

485
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,100
engineers hey give me some maps I want

486
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,549
to see some network diagrams I want to

487
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,320
you know and the more complicated it is

488
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,970
the more of them I have to get involved

489
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,700
and I say hey ok let's go to the

490
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,970
whiteboard and we draw it out you know I

491
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,190
did the Columbo thing because there's no

492
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,530
way we can know all the technologies

493
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,780
yeah they assume that we can secure all

494
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,340
the technologies without realizing the

495
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,530
fact that if you don't know how it works

496
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,809
you can't actually really secure it and

497
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:53,690
even worse if you don't know how it all

498
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:56,178
works together including the people in

499
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,330
it you're not going to be able to to

500
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:02,140
secure it I'll throw a little golden

501
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:06,168
nugget out there for you every person

502
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:10,490
involved interacting within a process

503
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:12,890
you can count as one vulnerability so

504
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,809
the more people you can reduce out of it

505
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:18,080
out of your process

506
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:21,980
is the less vulnerabilities you're going

507
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,740
to have it's true people are a mess yeah

508
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,659
they're chaotic they do whatever they

509
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,340
want you can come whatever training you

510
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:32,240
want they get tired and cranky and

511
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:35,120
they'll screw up anyways okay so I I do

512
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,100
as much separation as I can and I go

513
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,678
further I separate my security for my

514
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,230
assets you don't want your security

515
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,240
sharing resources with your assets

516
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,769
because when your security goes down or

517
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,350
your security has a hard time your

518
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:51,049
assets can't deliver either I like to

519
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,449
tell people it's kind of like if you're

520
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:56,119
defending a town you don't move all your

521
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,710
soldiers in that town to displace the

522
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:00,649
people that are there and eat their food

523
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,200
and drink their water and make them also

524
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:05,119
targets that's part of the problem I

525
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,980
mean you saw that with heartbleed with

526
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,499
heartbleed you had that problem where

527
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,049
you had as something secure like SSL

528
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:13,879
that became the vulnerability which took

529
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:16,759
the memory from the server that was

530
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:18,350
sharing and shared that out where that

531
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,149
didn't happen is where you had SSL

532
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,039
termination before the server because

533
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,139
there was nothing in memory to share and

534
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:28,220
what did you do you separated the

535
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:30,529
security from the asset so that's what I

536
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,590
do it's a good hints a good place to

537
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:36,850
start you do your separations then once

538
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,389
you're separated out and you have things

539
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,399
compartmentalizing you have a good idea

540
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:43,039
you want to clean the environment and

541
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:46,758
you want to own it okay so I'll go

542
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,710
through I'll check Wireshark I'll be

543
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,600
watching TCP dump I'm gonna try to

544
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,610
minimize the amount of noise that's in

545
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,289
there I want to start cleaning it up I

546
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,928
want to get rid of services we don't

547
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:59,179
need I want to do real hardening you

548
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:02,169
know by actually least privileged stuff

549
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:05,450
and not just installing more software I

550
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:09,529
want to reduce software yeah that

551
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,450
doesn't need to be and and it's amazing

552
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,639
how far you can go with that I mean

553
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,830
there's there's places where we don't

554
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,070
even running antivirus because you just

555
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,350
don't need it it just adds attack vector

556
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,700
and the places sometimes we have to put

557
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,860
it back in because compliance says

558
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,690
compliance says yeah you need this

559
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,490
product so go increase your attack

560
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,059
vectors so that

561
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:35,090
you can be more secure compliance for

562
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:39,230
you it's all it's all written by us now

563
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:40,580
so it's our fault next thing you want to

564
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,929
control the interactions where ever you

565
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,490
have interactions coming in because you

566
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,170
have operations you need to serve web

567
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,790
pages you need to do mail you need to

568
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,290
have DNS all this kind of stuff you want

569
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,629
to take control you want to start

570
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:54,530
putting controls on there authentication

571
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,360
encryption integrity checks I mean

572
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,300
there's there's ten controls use them

573
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,399
wisely use them broadly you put them out

574
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,520
there and you start controlling things

575
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,679
so really in that order separate clean

576
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,270
on your environment sorry I didn't say

577
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,850
much about owning it one of the things I

578
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,830
hate is default installs because when

579
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,980
you do default installs and has default

580
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,710
logins to falter why why make it so easy

581
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,000
for for someone make it make it

582
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,370
home-field advantage

583
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,679
install it the way you want to do what

584
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,449
you need to do so that you have so that

585
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,640
the attacker has a little bit harder to

586
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,290
understand what you're doing I like to

587
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,500
think of that as privacy as a control

588
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,240
yeah so then when all of those three

589
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,250
things are done then I start dealing

590
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,170
with vulnerabilities not before why

591
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,540
because I'm gonna have a whole lot less

592
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,400
of them to worry about and I have a

593
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,559
whole lot less to worry about patching

594
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,920
and hurrying and racing the the

595
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,780
criminals to patch okay why because

596
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,090
there's less for them to get to less

597
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,330
interactions less interactions less

598
00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:00,199
attack surface less attack surface less

599
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:02,629
putting out fires me more happy seeing

600
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,450
more movies getting home on time

601
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,280
yeah so when I get fired at least I can

602
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,100
be like oh they pay me pretty good and

603
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:14,540
you know I had a good run with Netflix

604
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,070
you know so I mean at least I enjoyed

605
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,830
what I did and that's the thing I

606
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,990
enjoyed it I enjoyed the whole security

607
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,428
part of it I enjoyed going through

608
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,910
Wireshark and looking for things I

609
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,490
enjoyed the incident response when I had

610
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,740
to and actually then investigating and

611
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:34,340
looking I enjoyed what I got into this

612
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,990
for you know not talking to Susan from

613
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,540
accounting about why her hard drives

614
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:42,230
making that light that's not why I got

615
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,090
into it you know I mean that was I

616
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,490
see support that was way back when I was

617
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,520
younger before there was IT security and

618
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:52,040
and I'm still doing it so I didn't have

619
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,470
to I fixed that part of it and I started

620
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,559
addressing things I like to think of

621
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:01,010
them as cybersecurity analgesics yeah I

622
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:03,950
just make things nicer feeling better

623
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:07,340
for me while actually securing and

624
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,720
fixing what needs to be fixed let me

625
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,010
give you a little hint this is a thing

626
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,840
called a four-point process one of the

627
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,390
things that we figured out was that

628
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,510
there's actually only four ways that

629
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,860
there could be any kind of interactions

630
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,960
so I didn't have to go nuts once we

631
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,149
figured out there was only four ways we

632
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,910
knew that there was you can interact

633
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,120
directly there was emanations coming off

634
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,799
of a target there was the environment

635
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,149
that you could establish facts from

636
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,010
things that you could see in the

637
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,110
environment and then of course you could

638
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,780
change resources in the environment to

639
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,428
affect the target as well and those were

640
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,110
the four things I had to look at so

641
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,970
anything that I had to security they'd

642
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,520
give me a new technology they'd say hey

643
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,160
we're gonna do this IOT thing or we're

644
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,610
going smart city or whatever it is they

645
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,020
throw at me I say okay I don't know it I

646
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,059
sit down with the engineers I start

647
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,740
plugging in here okay what are the

648
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:02,720
emanations there what's what's gonna

649
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,270
give off on this you know and I start

650
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,690
going through these one at a time what

651
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:11,210
kind of environment does it sit in this

652
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,340
tool here has saved my ass I don't know

653
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:17,240
how many times because I discover things

654
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:20,090
that everybody else forgot and what that

655
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,429
ends up doing for me is giving me peace

656
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,780
of mind I don't want to have to put out

657
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:25,910
fires I don't want to have to do

658
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,330
continuous maintenance that doesn't

659
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,679
scale if you have to put people on it to

660
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,320
check something and look at something

661
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:37,760
that's not gonna scale so this is

662
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,350
something you need to do we call

663
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,660
something called the we call this the

664
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,610
trifecta and this is another thing I

665
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,250
apply I look at these three things

666
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,168
how do current operations work how do

667
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,820
they work differently from how

668
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,770
management or the engineers think they

669
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,100
work and then how do they need to work

670
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,030
and I actually draw this out I take

671
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,030
these and I start

672
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:02,000
I do number one I draw it out then I go

673
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,889
to number two and this is kind of how it

674
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,450
looks like on a whiteboard this is

675
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:10,520
something I did actually two weeks ago

676
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:12,380
so I start with how it is now and how

677
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,970
we're gonna get there so on the left

678
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,640
hand side I have all the controls

679
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,440
there's ten controls list at the top I

680
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,560
look at the network the server the

681
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,450
application and I do this for each for

682
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,840
each one that they throw at me each each

683
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:29,030
new implementation yeah and and I look

684
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,740
at it as a whole and every X you see and

685
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,629
this is this is a real thing I just did

686
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,170
every X you see was where they had no

687
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:40,730
controls they had no security and this

688
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:43,100
was a live real business yeah it was and

689
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,200
so when I see this and they they

690
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,699
actually hired they wanted a penetration

691
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,390
test that I saw this and I said are you

692
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,660
kidding me

693
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,250
because I hate writing reports and if

694
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,200
you if you have to test something that

695
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,210
has no security you're looking at like a

696
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,790
500-page report right so I might as well

697
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:02,090
just build the damn thing for you yeah

698
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,560
so instead I show them this you take

699
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,820
this to management and be like see where

700
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,110
the x's are that's where you have no

701
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,100
security that's why I'm not gonna test

702
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:14,570
you let's fix this first yeah and then I

703
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:17,600
go and I take the red marker sometimes a

704
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:20,870
sharpie just to screw with them and I

705
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:24,409
start putting in ideas of what we can do

706
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:26,149
to improve it and I show them with them

707
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,360
their and their engineers there and I

708
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,790
start putting it out and what does that

709
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,500
do to business that shows progress that

710
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:37,129
shows something that's gonna happen it

711
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,510
shows them value okay it actually makes

712
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:44,690
them interested because now they get to

713
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:47,030
spend money yeah in the end I do write a

714
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,500
report and that report looks like this I

715
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,980
take the same thing I make it pretty

716
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,810
yeah and ice actually start putting in

717
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,340
possible solutions things that they

718
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,600
could do things that they could fix this

719
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,050
is actually from a smart city

720
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,740
implementation we just did in California

721
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:05,090
of street lighting like like so I was

722
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,910
working with a company called crypto

723
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,429
move who is who is putting in security

724
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,850
for for street lamps and

725
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,740
to the implementation but yeah this is

726
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,770
this is how I do it and then we deliver

727
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,570
this and they have a good idea of what

728
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,220
we're actually trying to do and you know

729
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,679
what else it does it covers my ass

730
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,590
so should something go wrong I could be

731
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,540
like yeah look I said it I said you're

732
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,629
missing these controls I'll get fired

733
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:37,450
anyways but but at least I have this and

734
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:39,640
I have your respect which means another

735
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,230
thing I do we have this vendor checklist

736
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,490
we came up with which kind of does the

737
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,760
same thing you can actually find this

738
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,980
online as a web app we're coming out

739
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,040
with iPhone and Android app as well for

740
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,990
it I think it's called security tuna and

741
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,940
basically what you do is you go through

742
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,830
it's 25 questions you answer questions

743
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,390
like does the vendor have a process for

744
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,189
assuring the identity of who they are

745
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,860
dealing with for administrative billing

746
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,360
and support services all yes or no you

747
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,340
go through you do that with the client

748
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,229
you do it by yourself it gives you

749
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,350
actual security score what their attack

750
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:14,080
surface probably is we've done many

751
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,000
tests with this from an actual real test

752
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,280
where we've done the security test

753
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,830
versus filling out the questionnaire we

754
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,930
come within ten percent accuracy which

755
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:26,230
is not bad for a freaking yes or no

756
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:27,790
question there so it's definitely worth

757
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,010
using especially against vendors that

758
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:32,320
you can't test or people you can't test

759
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,030
when I get vendors in who try to sell

760
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,100
something and a company asked me to sit

761
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,020
in and listen to them I'll pull out the

762
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,480
questionnaire ask them questions about

763
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,850
it it also does a trust analysis we have

764
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,710
another another 25 questions which will

765
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,110
tell us how trustworthy they are or if

766
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:51,340
they're bullshitting us all free online

767
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,840
you can just grab it helps a lot and it

768
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:58,540
talks to business in a way that they

769
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,770
understand yeah finally we have a thing

770
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,810
called the star

771
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,670
we're sorry these are attack surface

772
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:06,909
metrics I can actually count them up

773
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,140
using the the Austin I'm not sure if

774
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,050
you're familiar with the open-source

775
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,270
security testing methodology manual if

776
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,129
you don't know it you probably aren't in

777
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:20,170
security that long because it's been

778
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:22,390
around since 2001 and you can actually

779
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,380
measure an attack surface it's it's a

780
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,530
little complicated

781
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,789
there's a lot of universities writtens

782
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,789
thesis is on it and stuff on the math

783
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:32,919
but once you get to know it and you use

784
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:36,730
it you can be like holy crap man you

785
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,280
have a 14% attack surface here which

786
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,570
means it doesn't mean it's not risk it

787
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,220
doesn't mean you're gonna get attacked

788
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,350
but it means if somebody wants to attack

789
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,960
you they're gonna figure it out you got

790
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,459
to look at it this way if making this

791
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,740
always a question does making something

792
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,000
harder to do make it more secure so if

793
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,919
think about like encryption and things

794
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,530
like that does making something harder

795
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,200
to do make it more secure or does it

796
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:04,899
just shrink the amount of people who can

797
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,700
actually do it to you that's a huge

798
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,530
difference you know

799
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,510
that's by saying oh we don't put bars on

800
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:13,659
our second-story windows because you

801
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:17,050
know who can get there except people who

802
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:20,619
can climb so let's just hope they don't

803
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:24,040
show up you know and then we're secure

804
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:27,429
and it's the same idea so we say well

805
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,710
looks like 14% attack surface so you

806
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,500
know as long as those 14% don't show up

807
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:36,040
you're probably doing great you know so

808
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:38,739
so let's hope so security is a process

809
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,859
let's just call it security sis

810
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:44,799
get lucky yeah there's our catch phrase

811
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:48,429
Security's getting lucky there we can go

812
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,169
with that finally we have the star which

813
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:53,530
is the security test audit report which

814
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:55,418
you definitely should look into really

815
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,889
the great thing about this is it totally

816
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:58,750
covers your ass because you only see the

817
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,570
front page here there's seven pages and

818
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,250
the rest of it is yes or no questions

819
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,840
where you go through it tells you the

820
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,540
things that you've done in your test and

821
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,670
analysis yes or no and it gives you a

822
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,710
place where you explain why you didn't

823
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,470
do it customer said was out of scope

824
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,570
customer said no and then you sign it

825
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,118
and they sign it and they accept it and

826
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,170
then that way when they're breached cuz

827
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,359
they will because they didn't fix

828
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:25,000
anything you said then you can be like

829
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:28,930
no no it's here you said don't test this

830
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,390
and actually it's for one company I know

831
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,730
for a fact they went to court over this

832
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,368
and the star actually saved their asses

833
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:37,310
because the company signed off on it

834
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,680
because the company did

835
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:42,350
fix they did get breached it happened

836
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,140
yeah so this is definitely something you

837
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,730
want to look into it will help you work

838
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,500
with business plus it's a it's a nice

839
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,680
sheet and it gives them a score they

840
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,270
love their scores yeah so we actually do

841
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,890
a lot of these this one score says

842
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,860
ninety one point three which is actually

843
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:00,470
pretty high typical bank will run about

844
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,050
eighty seven it's based on a hundred

845
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:08,839
being their perfect balance of security

846
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:11,120
and so I mean you you can have you can

847
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,820
do any size any I mean it's completely

848
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,339
scalable but it's really really handy to

849
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:20,270
have to to give the report and I like to

850
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:22,460
think of them as as a security test

851
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,770
crack so like I'll give the first one

852
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,600
for free you know to the customer and

853
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,759
then and then they'll always come back

854
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,410
as always look for it because they're

855
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,090
like where's my score to all the other

856
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,830
people and they're like no no here you

857
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,470
have this yellow light on the traffic

858
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:39,770
symbol and they're like no no I want the

859
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:42,319
number so this is I'm telling you you

860
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:45,259
want a security crack again you'll get

861
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:50,360
fired right but but there's always more

862
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:53,600
crack addicts out there yeah okay

863
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,800
so in conclusion right they're all

864
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,900
scorpions you can do a better job

865
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,770
protecting yourself and you know not

866
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:07,150
hating security so much so thank you and

867
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,150
thank 44 Khan

868
