1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:18,650
well thank you so much thank you so um

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,439
as you may have heard my name is Sarah

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,349
this is my third long con talk so this

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,570
is exciting for me I like to talk about

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,690
social issues and security and

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,010
technology also my cat really needed you

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,640
to know that she helped with the slides

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:38,059
so a lots happened since my talk last

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,490
year I got my CCNA as you may have

10
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:43,160
guessed from the picture I graduated

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,960
finally so this also marks my first long

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,519
khanh slash besides for I'm not a

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,860
student

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,140
I graduated from Red River College's

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,910
business information technology program

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:01:01,010
with honors in April so I also adopted

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:02,449
not one but two snakes the cat adores

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,379
them if you were wondering they're

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,380
really cute together

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:11,540
I moved twice and I got an awesome job

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,580
so I'm an InfoSec analyst at IC group

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,190
and they are a marketing tech company I

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,630
do a lot of compliance security

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,149
awareness and training project

25
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:24,740
management and please don't throw me out

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:27,049
for this but I do internal audit so I'm

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,640
learning a lot love my workplace it's

28
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:31,790
been a great experience and we are

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,570
hiring Deb's right now if you or someone

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,470
you love is looking for a job as much as

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,330
I love my job

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,970
I don't really enjoy the long bus

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,369
commute it is 90 minutes each way on a

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,880
good day most of the time it's actually

35
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,530
two hours but all these changes in my

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,100
life mean that I now have free parking

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,270
at work and at home so decided it was

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,679
time to get my license and buy a car so

39
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,710
started taking driving lessons and

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,390
researching how to buy a car this

41
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,850
started with literally googling how do

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,400
you buy a car because I had no idea as

43
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,128
you can imagine there were tons of

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,319
results they all kind of said the same

45
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,120
thing so you start off you make some

46
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,560
decisions what can you afford

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,180
do you want to buy do you want to lease

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,580
are you looking for new are you looking

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,290
for used and consider quality

50
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,870
reliability total cost of

51
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,640
ownership that kind of thing more

52
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,159
detailed instructions would include

53
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,339
stuff about vin searches and Carfax

54
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:35,689
reports test drives vehicle inspections

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,290
warranty and safety ratings no one said

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:41,000
anything about software security updates

57
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,090
no one mentioned security at all not a

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,939
single car blog nothing I read about

59
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,909
buying or maintaining a car mentioned it

60
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,530
I talked to some the car people I knew

61
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:54,349
to ask their advice they didn't say

62
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,269
anything about it I thought well this

63
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,209
seems kind of like a big deal so I'm

64
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,829
gonna go talk to some tech people they

65
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,810
said I was overthinking this and this is

66
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,939
not an issue there were kind of they

67
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,379
fell into three camps they've never done

68
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:09,250
updates before nothing bad has happened

69
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:11,358
to them no that's a logical fallacy

70
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,290
we're not talking about self-driving

71
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:17,150
cars and the last one my favorite is all

72
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,138
its software of course it needs updating

73
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,260
duh

74
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,870
talk over all of them thought that this

75
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,940
talk idea was really dumb so what I've

76
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,889
come to the conclusion is next time I'm

77
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,079
floating a talk idea I'll do it in the

78
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:32,870
DC 204 slack channel because you guys

79
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,000
were way nicer about it but I almost

80
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,889
backed out of this talk I mean if

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,359
smarter and more experienced people are

82
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:40,579
telling me that this is a useless talk

83
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,079
then maybe I should just like listen

84
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,470
before I make a complete ask myself

85
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,419
however my anxiety over having to email

86
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,280
these people to cancel was greater than

87
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:53,269
my anxiety over having to give this talk

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,790
so here we are so I pushed forward with

89
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,680
research and thank you hoping that I was

90
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,418
onto something I'm gonna skip to the end

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,040
here and tell you like I'm pretty sure I

92
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:06,769
was what does software do in a car well

93
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,750
in a ward everything like literally

94
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,359
everything today vehicles are

95
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,669
distributed systems of over 40 computers

96
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,079
and millions of lines of code everything

97
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,639
from steering to breaking two lights

98
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,030
emissions control all of that is

99
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,500
controlled by software back in the olden

100
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,250
days I don't know how old the olden days

101
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,229
are but before software driven cars when

102
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,360
you hit the brakes for example you would

103
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:31,849
physically actually hit brakes in your

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,500
car now if you hit the brakes it sends a

105
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,370
signal to tell the software to hit the

106
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,900
brakes

107
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,360
also the stuff that you would expect GPS

108
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,469
infotainment systems apps obviously that

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,910
is also software so I think a lot of you

110
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,980
are gonna be really familiar with this

111
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,800
example because it's one that people

112
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,710
like to use a lot but in 2015 to

113
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,630
researchers presenting at blackhat

114
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,180
paektu Jeep Cherokee they had someone

115
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,219
else in the car driving and know this

116
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,530
person driving knew that they were gonna

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,850
hack the car didn't know exactly what

118
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,190
was gonna happen because they really

119
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,420
wanted to simulate remote hijacking the

120
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,710
only thing that these researchers

121
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,000
promise was that they weren't gonna kill

122
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:14,310
the guy so good on them so these

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
researchers were able to ingest climate

124
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,050
control settings radio steering

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,659
windshield wipers brakes acceleration

126
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,670
there is a video on YouTube of this guy

127
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,640
just absolutely terrified as people are

128
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,410
messing with this car now they were

129
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,479
presenting this research at blackhat

130
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,610
they were also nice enough to work with

131
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,430
Chrysler behind the scene so before this

132
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,260
research was presented Chrysler was able

133
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,580
to create a patch for that vulnerability

134
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,560
they mailed out USBs with the update to

135
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,030
1.4 million vehicle owners and advised

136
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,940
them that they needed to take their

137
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,789
vehicle into the dealership these same

138
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,430
researchers in 2013 also hacked a Toyota

139
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,440
Prius and a Ford Escape but this isn't

140
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,390
the only thing there have been lots of

141
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,910
other researchers who have hacked cars

142
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,159
before this and after this in fact a few

143
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,980
weeks later a different researcher was

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,840
presenting a different car hack at

145
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,490
DEFCON so we've determined there's lots

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400
of software in cars how are these

147
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,350
updates performed updates aren't really

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,239
standardized in any way and the exact

149
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,950
processes are gonna differ for make and

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,100
model but they kind of fall under the

151
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,200
same three categories we have perform by

152
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,000
dealership mechanic this is still the

153
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,630
most common way you bring your car into

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,950
the shop and the updates are installed

155
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,860
they're included while your car is still

156
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,930
under warranty OTA updates are

157
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,820
over-the-air many manufacturers are

158
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,280
doing this but they limit these to non

159
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,520
safety critical updates like to

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,830
infotainment systems and tests loud I

161
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,940
mean Tesla's a whole other ballpark they

162
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,140
have done update

163
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,450
all of them OTA since 2012 the last one

164
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,190
is you do it yourself with a USB the

165
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,800
user would download updates from the

166
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,790
manufacturer website copy them to USB

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,410
and install them on the vehicle

168
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:06,150
themselves now as you can imagine each

169
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,410
of these methods kind of comes with its

170
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,780
own set of challenges

171
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,790
performing by the dealership mechanic

172
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,280
you might not be notified of available

173
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,990
updates to your car you probably won't

174
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,000
be informed if any patches were applied

175
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,440
while your car was in because usually

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
what happens you bring your car in for

177
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,040
servicing they check if there's updates

178
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,360
they'll put them on and you kind of in

179
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,010
and out of there the user so you as car

180
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,380
owners are responsible for paying for

181
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,690
the updates after the vehicles out of

182
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,640
warranty there is an exception if

183
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,580
there's a legal requirement to do so

184
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,430
often in the case of critical safety or

185
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,550
emissions controls with over-the-air

186
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,100
updates that also comes with challenges

187
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,290
in the case of Tesla they take 20 to 90

188
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,300
minutes you can't drive your car can't

189
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,070
charge them during the updates they

190
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,140
can't be paused or stopped so once

191
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,260
you've committed once you've decided to

192
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,760
do the updates and even non safety

193
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,310
critical updates can have massive

194
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,830
impacts and doing it yourself with the

195
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,330
USB that can be complicated to the

196
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,729
average user and there is the potential

197
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,830
to break your car power supply remains

198
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,480
an issue so if you are in the middle of

199
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,219
an update and you run out of power you

200
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,260
could wipe the module completely and

201
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,640
usually that means that the entire thing

202
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:23,849
needs to be replaced so in February of

203
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,710
2018 Sirius XM deployed an OTA update to

204
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,360
certain Chrysler UConnect systems I

205
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,729
think we can all agree that as fun as

206
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,210
the radio is it's not critical to car

207
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,400
function however this update caused the

208
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,940
infotainment system screen to reboot

209
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,669
every 45 seconds not only was that super

210
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,800
annoying but drivers also lost access to

211
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,770
things like climate control rearview

212
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:51,930
cameras voice assistance user settings

213
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:53,910
the SOS feature these users also had a

214
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,370
hard time getting service or support for

215
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,780
this they could call Chrysler who told

216
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,190
them to call you connect he told them to

217
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,900
call Sirius and they were getting the

218
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,560
runaround

219
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,510
so this went a while before it was fixed

220
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,520
as a result of this update gone horribly

221
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,740
wrong a class-action lawsuit was filed

222
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,689
against Chrysler in September of this

223
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,750
year so OTA updates obviously have some

224
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,750
advantages and some disadvantages save

225
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,370
time for money and for the user and the

226
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,000
manufacturer don't have to bring your

227
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,800
car in so eat higher percentage of patch

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,440
is being applied because it takes less

229
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,069
effort to do so and it's easier to

230
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,380
support out of warranty vehicles the

231
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,940
disadvantages because more people are

232
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,540
applying the patches when things go

233
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,250
wrong it goes very wrong yeah there's a

234
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,010
need for improved networking

235
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,720
capabilities and vehicles and it opens

236
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,160
the door to more vulnerabilities because

237
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,770
stuff's on the Internet so despite these

238
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,050
very real and scary drawbacks OTA

239
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,300
updates are probably the best option we

240
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,219
have available and even if they're not

241
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,910
this is the direction manufacturers are

242
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,160
headed in for GM and Toyota have all

243
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,779
said that they're 2020 models will have

244
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,939
all of their updates delivered OTA I did

245
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,250
not go on the website and research all

246
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,350
of their models for this year to see if

247
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,950
that happens this is just what they have

248
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:27,110
said so do I need to worry about

249
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,190
security updates for my car well I'm not

250
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,110
going to tell you how to live your life

251
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,990
you can worry about what you worry about

252
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,890
but I know I'm concerned about security

253
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,630
updates for cars dashboard I know that's

254
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:43,370
not the kind of dashboard he meant but I

255
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:45,920
went with that so what about extended

256
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,779
support for cars because everything's

257
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,589
computerized these parts are a lot more

258
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,970
complex than they ever used to be

259
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,880
because this is software you're now

260
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,970
dealing with licensing and licensing

261
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,500
protections means that there are fewer

262
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,010
third-party manufacturers for parts

263
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,870
this means that parts are more expensive

264
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:09,470
because you have to buy the manufacturer

265
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,450
part also manufactures don't have the

266
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,750
ability to maintain all of the software

267
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,390
so for any given year

268
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,950
every make and model will have a

269
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,520
different slightly different variation

270
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,320
of software the average lifespan of a

271
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,930
car on the road these days is 11 years

272
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:30,160
and well not all of that software is

273
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,140
being maintained it's just not so there

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,050
are definitely a lot of cars on the road

275
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,480
that have outdated software with no

276
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,180
available patches and these older

277
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,150
vehicles might not meet the current

278
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,459
emissions or safety standards now you

279
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,810
think okay I'm smart I know my way

280
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,370
around the computer I know my way around

281
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,550
some software I'll just fix that

282
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,600
myself well you can again I'm not gonna

283
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,760
tell you how to live your life but

284
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,110
you'll hold your warranty and you will

285
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,840
violate DMCA I think I'm kidding well in

286
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,730
December of 2014 California farmers

287
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,910
wanting to maintain their own equipment

288
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,950
fought the Copyright Bureau farmers like

289
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,750
any other drivers have no right to

290
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,450
access or modify the source code on

291
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,580
their machines can't change their engine

292
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,190
settings they can't they can't they

293
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,230
basically can't fix their farm equipment

294
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,710
without going to their license John

295
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,770
Deere dealer now if you know any farmers

296
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:29,440
you'll know that during during harvest

297
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,180
season these people are busy so they are

298
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,800
going to fix their tractors and combines

299
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,689
and they are gonna get back to Turin

300
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,609
like they don't have time to wait a few

301
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,100
days till they're John Deere mechanic is

302
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,510
available so they fought the Copyright

303
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,050
Bureau saying they should have the right

304
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,610
to fix their own equipment but John

305
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,280
Deere came back with the argument that

306
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,900
farmers receive an implied license for

307
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,860
the life of the vehicle to operate the

308
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,589
vehicle that is what their license says

309
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,070
in 2018 so last year the Copyright

310
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,630
Office ruled in favor of John Deere

311
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,940
that's gonna have some huge implications

312
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:08,880
going forward with software ownership

313
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:13,120
especially in IOT devices and vehicles

314
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,740
so what does this all mean so some are

315
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,410
starting to call this generation the

316
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,780
first generation of disposable cars if

317
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,180
the parts are more expensive in general

318
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,040
you kind of decide if you're going to

319
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,900
repair or replace your car based on

320
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,319
whether or not it is more expensive to

321
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,720
buy a new car or to

322
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,640
preparing it parts are more expensive

323
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,390
than you get to that I need to buy a new

324
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,920
car stage a lot faster and we're growing

325
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,360
towards this trend of like let's do

326
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,819
everything is a subscription model

327
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,500
anyways so as we push forward I think

328
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,440
that leasing is likely going to become a

329
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,120
much more attractive option and given

330
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,220
the outcome of the john deere lawsuit

331
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,730
buying has definitely become a lot more
