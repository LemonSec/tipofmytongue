1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,439
[Music]

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,439
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,650
so I have to say when I was telling my

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,820
co-workers I'm going back to Winnipeg

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,070
one of them was like why is there a

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:30,680
security conference in Winnipeg in

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:35,360
November I think I'm slack Mike Santa

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:41,140
made people tougher but either way so

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,140
does anyone know what that image is yeh

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:49,670
so if one person got it I would have

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:54,590
bought drinks of ten people get it I

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,940
guess I didn't put all in Ron's tab so

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,450
fairly obviously nothing I say

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,250
represents my employer so what I'll

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,140
cover today is you're already an expert

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,990
in two of these thanks to Mike's talk

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,149
but I'll still go over them anyway

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,060
so basically an overview of what Active

19
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:13,850
Directory is the common attacks which

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:19,640
should be open file shares Kerberos ting

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:22,369
and then credential theft so in terms of

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,380
what is AD anyway it's basically the

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,750
identity and access management system

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,908
that runs in virtually every company

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,400
worldwide so it's a collection like

26
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:35,000
users service accounts which we'll get

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,890
to computers for Policy objects you can

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,820
join multiple Active Directory domains

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:43,159
together into forests so if you want to

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:49,100
own the enterprise this is a pretty good

31
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:52,310
start so as I mentioned why attack ad

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,899
it's used in most of the fortune 500

33
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,740
aside from Google I'm not sure that

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,720
there's another exception at this point

35
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,939
so it controls access to all the most

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,829
confidential data in the organization

37
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:05,600
because everyone likes single sign-on

38
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,520
you don't want to have to log into every

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,978
single app in the organization you just

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,049
want to log in once and then from there

41
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,049
you can go to any website any sharepoint

42
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:18,340
site whatever and it all just works that

43
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,340
is the magic of Active Directory

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,920
so the main thing is it's often an

45
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,390
organizational blind spot though so

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,609
Stefan 80 is not going to appear in your

47
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,130
necess cans it's not gonna appear in

48
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,930
your rapid7 stands unless you have

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,170
someone working for you who really

50
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,880
understands Active Directory security

51
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,160
it's probably a product you installed in

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,470
like the year 2000 and just kept

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,910
building off of and if you acquired

54
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,950
companies you just toss them in your

55
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,500
domain or better yet you just join them

56
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,929
to your forest and it's not something

57
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,180
really think about in terms of security

58
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,750
and it's just something that grows over

59
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,180
time so the infrastructure people often

60
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,680
are fairly knowledgeable about it but

61
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,959
they're told fairly clearly by

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,820
management that availability is the only

63
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,590
thing they really care about the other

64
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,450
parts of AD don't show up on their VA

65
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,030
scan reports people don't really

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:19,970
understand it so availability is what

67
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:22,400
ends up winning the day there so the

68
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,070
first thing I'll cover is open file

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,500
shares and I mean as an attacker if you

70
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,720
drop on a machine through phishing you

71
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,390
may not have to do anything else you

72
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,900
drop on a machine you load up Power View

73
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,320
you can do invoke share finder just as

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,519
Micah said and you're gonna get

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,890
potentially hundreds or thousands of

76
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,540
open shares you still have to sort

77
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,730
through that data some of it will be

78
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,760
interesting some of it will be stuffy

79
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,798
and care about but the main way a lot of

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,970
organizations still collaborate is file

81
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,160
shares so HR Payroll executives they're

82
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,769
all sharing and collaborating over a

83
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,109
file share and often those permissions

84
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,079
were set up once and someone will

85
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,760
accidentally add you know domain users

86
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,790
you know just to make it work for

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,078
someone's access or everyone and they

88
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,630
thought they were going to remove it at

89
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:23,060
that point but no one ever goes and

90
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:25,520
reviews those permissions so what that

91
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,320
basically means is you've got almost all

92
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,020
the data you could want without having

93
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,360
to exploit anything that most users in

94
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,530
domain are gonna have access to so even

95
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,540
if it is in something

96
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,880
this like domain users or everyone

97
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,890
there's usually a few organizational

98
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,440
groups are added way too often to these

99
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,630
file shares that'll still give thousands

100
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:50,300
of users access to a file share that

101
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:53,659
they shouldn't have so power view and

102
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,430
invoke share Finder is the best tool I'm

103
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,650
not aware of another commercial tool

104
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,200
that'll scan file shares like Power View

105
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,330
it's a free set of powershell scripts

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,580
and it's still the best way to see your

107
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:09,500
attack surface for them so the way it

108
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,210
works is it basically gets all the

109
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,810
computers from the domain then they'll

110
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,180
ask everyone hey what share CEO is on

111
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,740
your machine and they'll say it'll just

112
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,500
try and open them and see if it as

113
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,500
access or not so in terms of detection

114
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,870
if you have something like pcap running

115
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,789
or NetFlow it should look fairly obvious

116
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,710
that you have one computer in the domain

117
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,930
connecting to every other computer

118
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,450
that's not something that would normally

119
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,100
be happening other than like your

120
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,469
vulnerability scanners your enterprise

121
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,180
stuff maybe but if you have someone in

122
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,190
accounting connecting to every other

123
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:52,729
computer in the organization there's

124
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:55,070
probably something shady going on so the

125
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,340
next tactic I'll get to is Kerberos

126
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,669
sting so this is still surprisingly

127
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,070
effective and it it's only for service

128
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:06,080
accounts but the catch is what

129
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,360
identifies a service account to Active

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Directory is having a service principle

131
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,070
name set it doesn't mean there's an

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,409
actual service associated with it if

133
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,540
someone accidentally sets an Espeon on

134
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,400
their account or if they installed

135
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,250
something like sequel server Express or

136
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,250
any other software it'll set that SPN

137
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,340
and if it's not cleaned up you can end

138
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,770
up with regular users with an SPN set

139
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:36,320
and that's all you need in order to

140
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:38,479
Kerberos them so the basic concept is as

141
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,880
an Active Directory user just an

142
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,969
authenticated user you can request a

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,130
service ticket for any service so that

144
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,120
service ticket that comes back is

145
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,730
encrypted

146
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,350
with the service account password that's

147
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:57,680
just the way the Kerberos flow works so

148
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,860
if we can basically request the service

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,020
tickets from every service in the domain

150
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,990
we're able to brute force at offline

151
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:09,320
with tools like ocl hash cat John

152
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:13,520
there's a bunch of others so if the

153
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,800
encryption type is rc4 it's fairly weak

154
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:25,250
and it's very practical to brute force

155
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:27,200
them so the other interesting attack

156
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,450
that you could do if you'd compromised

157
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,460
the service count is let's say you were

158
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,500
able to successfully brute-force that

159
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,960
ticket you have access to everything

160
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,790
that service has access to that's fairly

161
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,680
obvious somebody to access to a database

162
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,740
for example he have acts as a database

163
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,210
or file share the other thing in enables

164
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,760
though is something called a silver

165
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,310
ticket attack I'm sure how many people

166
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,780
have heard of the golden ticket attack

167
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,080
okay that's pretty good show hands there

168
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,090
so the silver ticket attack is that but

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,310
there's scoped to one individual service

170
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,679
so instead of being able to spoof any

171
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,140
user in the domain to any service you

172
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,690
could spoof it to one in particular so

173
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,490
if you had a database for example that

174
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,650
was using Kerberos for authentication

175
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,810
and let's say was very locked down and

176
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,359
maybe only one user had access or a

177
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,270
particular table you would be able to

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,010
use that service account password to

179
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,010
spoof that user and access that database

180
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,270
so and of course when you have a service

181
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:34,539
account in the domain admin group it's

182
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:37,669
pretty awesome so in terms of mitigation

183
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,069
the real issue is you would need to log

184
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:43,848
every time a service ticket is requested

185
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,500
in Active Directory and people just as

186
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,029
part of their day-to-day request service

187
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,630
tickets all the time whether doing a

188
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,610
file share database whatever so if in

189
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,860
like a large enterprise environment

190
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,880
you're gonna see a lot of service ticket

191
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,430
requests so if you choose to enable the

192
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,420
basically what you need to

193
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,979
the attack oops expect a lot of logs on

194
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,689
your Active Directory domain controller

195
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,210
so you don't have to be able to have a

196
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,970
sim to offload them too but what you

197
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:20,260
would basically be looking for

198
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:21,760
everything better now what you would

199
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,939
basically be looking for is someone

200
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,160
requesting service tickets for say 200

201
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,040
services in a very short period of time

202
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,380
using rc4 encryption which is the

203
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,849
weakest available it's commonly used for

204
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:39,280
Active Directory so the other thing

205
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,010
would just be to check for users who

206
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,839
have accidentally sent SPN you can go

207
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,880
into power of you get a list of all the

208
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,740
service accounts and if you see just

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,689
user names popping up there you should

210
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,400
be able to safely remove the SPN from

211
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:58,150
their account and they'll no longer be

212
00:09:51,400 --> 00:10:01,120
Kerberos table which is a plus so the

213
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,939
last tactical cover is credential theft

214
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,130
so this is a base one that you're going

215
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,350
to use anytime you're basically going up

216
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:14,410
against Active Directory at some point

217
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:16,480
you're gonna be stealing credentials so

218
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,600
often you're gonna land on a host as an

219
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,750
unprivileged user and then you're gonna

220
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,730
be going for an attack path to get from

221
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,170
one in order to your goal which might be

222
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:37,680
the domain admins group might be to

223
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:37,680
access a certain service or whatever so

224
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,910
let's say we're trying to access the

225
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,680
computer with top-secret plans so the

226
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,530
user we dropped onto doesn't have access

227
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,209
that kind of sucks but through the magic

228
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,280
of Active Directory we can easily

229
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,830
enumerate who to actually does have

230
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,050
access to that so let's say we're after

231
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:02,080
a computer with top-secret clients on it

232
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:08,079
we can actually use Power View to find

233
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:10,840
out who's in the local administer so

234
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,990
just using the get net local group name

235
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,459
- computer name whatever we can pull

236
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,649
in that local men groups so that's

237
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:20,020
really really useful to us as attackers

238
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:25,690
because already is gonna tell us who we

239
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:28,000
need to target so we may have a list of

240
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,209
ten different people of access we may

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,709
not directly have access to that but it

242
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:34,959
allows us to start forming an attack

243
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,880
chain of those ten uses we can see do we

244
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:44,079
have access to any of their machines and

245
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,910
so forth so you can easily have an

246
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,850
attack path like that so we're starting

247
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,540
from Alice we can see she has

248
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,279
administrative access to John's computer

249
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,740
let's say John has logged in John

250
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,410
himself has access to Bob's computer and

251
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,690
Bob has access to the top-secret plans

252
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,149
so we can see there's a fairly obvious

253
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,160
attack path here so if you use a tool

254
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:08,620
like bloodhound it's basically going to

255
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,510
run a collector it's going to gather all

256
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,850
this information from the domain all

257
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,860
passively so it's going to dump all of

258
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,959
your users all of your computers and all

259
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,980
the relations together so you're going

260
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,199
to be able to go into a piece of

261
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,290
software and say hey I have access to

262
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Alice's account do I have a path to top

263
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,630
secret so it's fairly obvious we have

264
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:36,459
two credentials to steal and then we can

265
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:39,070
get to top secret so the reason why this

266
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:41,469
works is I mentioned once you log into

267
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,839
Windows you're generally not prompted

268
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,790
for your credentials again your

269
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,500
credentials are stored in the else's

270
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,149
purses so let's say you want to go

271
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,709
access a file share a SharePoint site

272
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,500
it's just going to pull those

273
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,000
credentials out of memory for you

274
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,740
authenticate to that service and then

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,350
you're done you're not actually prompted

276
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:04,120
for your credentials so the side effect

277
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,089
of that is anyone with administrative

278
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,500
access to your computer use able to pull

279
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,500
those credentials out of memory as well

280
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,180
so how many people have local admins law

281
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,050
local admin rights locked down in their

282
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:20,829
organization Joe hands there's like

283
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:23,479
there's three okay that's promising

284
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,970
for the recipe out there this is kind of

285
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,830
problematic though because if the

286
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,080
attacker is running as local de min

287
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,730
which they probably will be they can

288
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:38,300
pull credential side in memory it's like

289
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:41,060
that so in terms of detecting credential

290
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,279
theft it's not particularly easy you

291
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,859
would need something like in EDR product

292
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,170
for those who aren't familiar like if

293
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,480
you they're sometimes called next-gen AV

294
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,979
which I don't like but they're basically

295
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,440
it's detections based on behaviors

296
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,480
rather than signatures so if you see a

297
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,670
pro something that's opening up the L

298
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,870
SAS process for example that's not

299
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,670
normal

300
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,500
there's the only thing I've actually

301
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,839
seen open up the else's process

302
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,320
legitimately is other security products

303
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,310
and that resulted in lots and lots of

304
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:18,500
false positives but in normal operations

305
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:20,449
nothing should be opening up L SAS so on

306
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,700
the plus side Microsoft actually has

307
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,560
quite a few mitigations for credential

308
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,079
theft if you choose to implement them

309
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,880
none of these are on by default it's all

310
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:33,979
stuff you actually have to make effort

311
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,390
to do so I mean for all of this you have

312
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,000
to review who has access to your

313
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,790
resources so the fact that we could make

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,380
an easy attack plan like that from Alice

315
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,599
all the way to top-secret plans is

316
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,939
probably because no one ever reviewed

317
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,440
what axis she had or if she had any

318
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,329
valid need to have access to Bob's

319
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,980
computer it could have been five years

320
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:54,349
ago they were working on something and

321
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,110
like oh let me add you to my local men

322
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,940
group and it was never reviewed again so

323
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,610
if you can't mitigate that part of the

324
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:05,810
attack path things just generally aren't

325
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:10,930
gonna go well for you so there's a nice

326
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:14,060
feature w digest who's heard of it yeh

327
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,130
because instead of putting her hash in

328
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,989
memory which is that enough and ntlm

329
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,480
hash is almost plaintext at this point

330
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,329
they can just put just the plaintext

331
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,180
password so that means that hey if you

332
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:28,250
want to RDP you can you can't already P

333
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,719
with a hash in general but you can

334
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,020
already P with someone's plaintext

335
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,220
password so W digest is only off by

336
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,290
default in

337
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,180
your versions and windows but if you've

338
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,670
never looked at it in your organization

339
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,479
chances are W digest is still probably

340
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,370
on just for legacy purposes so you

341
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,950
should be able to turn that off without

342
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:52,460
any impact the other thing is if your

343
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:55,550
domain is all Windows 10 or Server 2016

344
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,660
and over you can no longer enumerate

345
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:02,270
who's in the local admin just as an

346
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,670
authenticated user to the domain so that

347
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,569
makes enumeration with bloodhound a lot

348
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,209
more difficult

349
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,730
so like that attack path wouldn't work

350
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,410
if John was not logged in you know to

351
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,660
his computer in order to complete that

352
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,060
chain so the fact that you can no longer

353
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:24,680
see who's logged in makes it a lot more

354
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:26,900
difficult so one of the good mitigations

355
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,660
Microsoft has is called credential guard

356
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:33,290
so this was released back in 2015 at

357
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,360
blackhat and it's 2019 now and

358
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,589
enterprises I think are only starting to

359
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,960
get up to Windows 10 where they could

360
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,700
actually implement it so it stores their

361
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,890
credentials in a secure Enclave in

362
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,730
memory so you can use them to

363
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,439
authenticate

364
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,230
that's why single sign-on still works

365
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,640
but you can no longer basically grab

366
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,160
them out of memory with something like

367
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,740
mimic hats so you could grab like an

368
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,140
ntlm v2 handshake as if you're

369
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,910
authenticating to a service but the

370
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,080
event is you can't pass that hash and

371
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,439
it's a little more difficult to

372
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,730
brute-force and just straight ntlm so if

373
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,580
you can able some of the credential

374
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,230
guard it's a lot more difficult to chain

375
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,500
together these credential theft and

376
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:16,220
attack pass so the biggest thing though

377
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,780
it's not compatible with VMware virtual

378
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,910
box which really sucks

379
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,770
so you could either enable it for your

380
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,450
non-technical employees who have no need

381
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:29,660
for VMs or make everyone switch to

382
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:31,900
Microsoft's virtualization it's like oh

383
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,730
[Music]

384
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,500
so the other pretty cool feature that

385
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,330
takes almost nothing to implement is

386
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,610
just to put your server administrators

387
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,199
and domain administrators who hopefully

388
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,110
are using separate accounts not their

389
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,020
day-to-day for domain admin put them in

390
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:51,199
protected users group this is a feature

391
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,629
in Windows 2008 and basically you can't

392
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,420
seal what's not there so it's not going

393
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,910
to store those credentials in memory and

394
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,490
it basically disables a lot of the very

395
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,920
insecure encryption methods like rc4

396
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,110
until M is no longer supported it's

397
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,690
gonna block that so even if you're able

398
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,000
to get on a workstation and run

399
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,620
something like mimic hats when a domain

400
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,940
admin was logged in if they're in this

401
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,929
user group you're not going to be able

402
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,930
to get their credentials

403
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,580
so in summary definitely reviewer

404
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,800
organizations you know strategy for

405
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,080
credential theft see if you enable

406
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,460
something protect a user's group most

407
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,460
computers have the hardware now to

408
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,120
support credential guard so if you can

409
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,800
all enable it definitely do so and

410
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,270
understand your attack surface use the

411
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,490
product like bloodhound to see what the

412
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,800
attack paths look like using VOC share

413
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,600
finder see what the attack so surface

414
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,399
looks like and mostly see if you can

415
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,840
detect them or if you have those kind of

416
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:57,950
controls there any questions

417
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,949
