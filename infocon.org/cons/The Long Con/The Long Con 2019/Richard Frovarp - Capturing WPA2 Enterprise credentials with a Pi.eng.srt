1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,680
[Applause]

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,180
thank you so I am Richard fubar I am

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,539
going to talk about capturing wpa2

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,369
enterprise credentials with a PI I am

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,020
the principal software engineer at North

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,490
Dakota State University down in Fargo

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,820
where I do Identity and Access

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,259
Management and federated authentication

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,270
so standard disclaimer bla bla bla bla

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,120
bla

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,649
I'm university so they don't care but so

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,780
first your question you might have is

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,360
why am I doing this with a PI and why

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,410
not a pineapple well because of $35 pi

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,089
is cheaper than a pineapple I'm a

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,480
software engineer I'm not network or

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:49,100
security or a pen tester so if 35 bucks

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,610
was easy the paddle just picked it up

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,110
yeah um and so everything I'm describing

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,820
here will work on a pineapple and

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,579
probably will work better if you're not

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,770
familiar with the pineapple it is a $200

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,719
I believe for the cheap one Wireless

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,969
testing device to compromise stuff and

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,479
test Wireless so 35 bucks is cheaper

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,250
than 200 so before we go into talking

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,189
about captioning enterprise credentials

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,030
what are Enterprise credentials so let's

29
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:20,428
focus on the two types of WPA see if

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,509
personal which is the uses of pre-shared

31
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:24,090
key which is what you're probably

32
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,770
familiar with from home you just have

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,789
one pre shared key and you share it on

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,590
out and it works great on all the modern

35
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:35,069
consumer devices and by that I'm talking

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,279
televisions and Roku's and chromecast's

37
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,810
and I have it's not my network because

38
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:42,298
once again I'm not networking right but

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,429
we have 3000 people living on our

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,899
network so some of the stuff I say might

41
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:48,749
sound crazy to you from the corporate

42
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,520
side because you operate completely if

43
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:53,399
we have 3000 people like living on our

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,319
network and so personal exceedingly

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,509
common there are some systems out there

46
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,569
they can do a pre-shared key a unique

47
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,630
pre shared key per MAC address and we

48
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,729
have that so students can put their hue

49
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,949
lights on the network or the Roku's or

50
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,450
their insert other fun things on the

51
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,260
wireless network so yeah um

52
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,260
alternatively you want to do enterprise

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,149
which is much more difficult Roku don't

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,530
support enterprise but it's one for you

55
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,940
when you want each user to have their

56
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,350
own credentials

57
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,910
this makes it so that you can do

58
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,220
identity access management much easier

59
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,100
when somebody leaves you don't have to

60
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,940
go back to every single other device and

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,989
reset the pre shared key when someone

62
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,290
leaves because they would know what the

63
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,990
pre shared key is there are two types of

64
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,489
credentials typically maybe I don't know

65
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,320
but you have using a password which is

66
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,640
what you're really familiar with and you

67
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,680
can go against something like open LDAP

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,059
or Active Directory and then give your

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,890
x.509 certificates once again I said

70
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,770
here's the two types this a little bit

71
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,839
more um the x.509 requires public key

72
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,970
infrastructure to sign the certificates

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,630
to generate the private keys to validate

74
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,500
it it is just a cert that lets you get

75
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,620
on the network

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,060
and so with that if you managed to

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,590
somehow intercept the traffic you're

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,390
intercepting a cert and not somebody's

79
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,700
Active Directory credentials that could

80
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,250
be used to gain access to anything else

81
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,720
that Active Directory lets you in and

82
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,640
then the other option I said was using a

83
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,020
password so perhaps we can do something

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,970
with that so here's how you do it on a

85
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,030
PI there's a project out there called

86
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,750
host APD and that allows you to

87
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,940
effectively run a access point off of a

88
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,850
computer so on a PI what you could do is

89
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,459
you could install hostapd and instead

90
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,920
have it Alfre up wireless over the wire

91
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,200
wireless card and then you you know jack

92
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,809
into the wire the actual connection it

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,179
would act as your access point the WP e

94
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,690
stands for wireless portage edition so

95
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,350
you know it's good how you do this it's

96
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,660
nice and easy

97
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,810
um you install Kali on your favorite

98
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,910
Raspberry Pi three B's these are kind of

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,950
what three four years old now they're

100
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,680
the easiest ones to do the three B

101
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,040
pluses don't the wireless card changed

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,370
and I I'm not quite sure about the for

103
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,350
statement I got there it it probably

104
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,580
does I put my for to other use but you

105
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,600
have to if you're using one of those you

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,880
need to pick up like one of these cheap

107
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,810
little USB for some reason what's is my

108
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,340
back wasn't my backpack little Kanna kit

109
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,919
wireless dongle and that works just fine

110
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,950
so you do sudo apt install host a PDW II

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,640
because I don't do root on Kali I use

112
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,990
sudo and open SSL tells you is gonna

113
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,020
take a long time to generate the search

114
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,170
for Jose

115
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,909
I'm a Linux admin by history I'm used to

116
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,950
open SSL Tommy's get to take a long time

117
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,230
and it takes 30 seconds and it's done or

118
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,260
or less this has taken me like 40

119
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,360
minutes this is this is a long time this

120
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,890
is like keep checking back like maybe I

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,810
should have actually installed screen on

122
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,479
this thing so I can disconnect because

123
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm doing over SSH you've killed the

124
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,020
HTTP when you're doing this when you

125
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,450
actually start trying to launch it and

126
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,270
it's not DHCP you're killing Ehrmann

127
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,099
check and that takes down DHCP so if you

128
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,450
have it headless on your network like I

129
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,710
have and then the next day you try to

130
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,140
find it it doesn't have an IP address

131
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,870
anymore so you maybe want to give it a

132
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,580
head or static you go into the

133
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,190
configuration file you maybe edit the

134
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,599
SSID see target SSID you want and then

135
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,950
you watch and you watch credentials come

136
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,350
in assuming you have something that's

137
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,930
gonna attack that this is one spot the

138
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,210
manual edit SSID I haven't used any of

139
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,370
the modern pinapples I'm guessing they

140
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,840
can probably start figuring out which SS

141
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,550
IDs people are looking for start just

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,570
automatically attacking it I believe

143
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:40,420
this one can only do one at a time you

144
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,010
maybe can't see that that's it working

145
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,110
for some reason when I punched it in and

146
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,230
just did things my username was terrific

147
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,880
gdv but I'll go into the details in a

148
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,950
moment

149
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,490
so what are we attacking here we are

150
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,099
attacking peep using mschap v2 so mschap

151
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,450
v2 we're continuing the trend here

152
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,210
talking about stuff that comes from NT

153
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,240
days this is from an t4 s before I guess

154
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,390
with 98 so it's rather old peep is from

155
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,100
2005 it's an industry effort so we're

156
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,780
not talking anything modern and so the

157
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,940
abstract oppresses of what's going on

158
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,500
here with wireless is it the device is

159
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,510
looking for SSID you probably all know

160
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,430
perhaps better than I how it goes about

161
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,890
and finds that SSID but it's finding the

162
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,919
society that it wants to talk to since

163
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,380
an anonymous outer identity in plain

164
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,000
text over-the-air to the radius system

165
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,100
connected to peep radius is the

166
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,810
enterprise authentication system that is

167
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,400
used and it's in the plane it just goes

168
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,169
out in the plane and presumably anybody

169
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,200
can see it and it goes to the system

170
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,090
this third middle one here might be

171
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,250
something odd for people in the

172
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,219
enterprise but it

173
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,810
the connected radius system figures out

174
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,220
where it needs to send your credentials

175
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,990
or it can actually can proxy you to

176
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,720
other radius systems which is something

177
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,950
we do and so you may or may not be

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,440
talking with the radius system that's

179
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,330
connected to the access point it creates

180
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,610
a TLS session between the device and

181
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,570
radius whatever and radius you're

182
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,940
talking to that you've been proxy

183
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,250
through and then the identity itself is

184
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,260
sent in the plane so you username is

185
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:20,410
sent in the plane and the creds are set

186
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:23,440
in mschap v2 so host HP d WP e we act as

187
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,920
a destination radius system and we can

188
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,719
get the username and the creds so we can

189
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,600
see here that it the username is

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,010
terrific gvv it spits out and I'll go

191
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,720
over the challenge in response this is

192
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,400
for a different sort of method of

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,530
attacking I'm assuming you see the

194
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
cursor on the screen maybe that but and

195
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,210
then this is John the Ripper format here

196
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
and then hash cat Bowl that format and

197
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,979
so you just grab those things and throw

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,950
them into your favorite cracker

199
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,750
obviously out of Pi I we are doing a

200
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,360
hacking lab that we run around and do

201
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,430
things with and on the PI we you know do

202
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,050
a pre-populated word list because a PI

203
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,130
is not gonna crack passwords very

204
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,690
quickly so there's one called asleep a

205
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,080
asleep I don't know how you pronounce it

206
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,370
first developed in 2004 by Joshua right

207
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,990
we end up with control with the random

208
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,650
value and so what it does to

209
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,600
authenticate is it des encrypts the

210
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:20,620
number three times using parts of the

211
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,410
ntlm hash and your ntlm hash is 16 bytes

212
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,979
and so does 7 bytes 7 bytes 2 bytes so

213
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,300
that third des is a 2 to the 16th

214
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,800
combination so it's really easy so now

215
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,710
you only have to crack two Dez's and

216
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,719
it's the same random so you get the same

217
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:38,620
sort of information out of it and you

218
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:43,320
can start doing a dictionary search so

219
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:46,240
how do you defend against this sort of

220
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,339
credential grabbing and using peep and

221
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,500
the answer is you don't use PP you see

222
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,900
TLS and I'll get into the challenges

223
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,330
behind that in a moment

224
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:58,630
so things that you could do and you

225
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,580
probably should but the clients can be

226
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,649
configured to validate the radius

227
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,569
certificate the

228
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,300
being presented to it so you think of

229
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:08,939
your web of trust sort of thing in TLS

230
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,248
over the web over HTTP you're validating

231
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:12,480
that the cert is in your trust path this

232
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:14,040
wouldn't even have to be in the truss

233
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,749
path you wouldn't want to have the

234
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,769
wireless devices trusting the trust path

235
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:19,439
because anybody could come up with

236
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:21,480
something but you can provide your own

237
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:24,118
certificate and when you configure the

238
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,399
clients you can say okay only talk to

239
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:29,160
this sir so then it would an attacker

240
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,559
spins up a system on their pie or the

241
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,529
pineapple it won't connect because it

242
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,879
doesn't match the cert and Apple devices

243
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,290
do this by default so when you first

244
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,480
connect an apple device to one of these

245
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,910
networks it will prompt the user to

246
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,149
accept that certificate from the radio

247
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,730
system so that's kind of good for Apple

248
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:50,069
um however I'm sure you can figure a way

249
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,600
out to a social engineer and make it so

250
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:54,660
people go through and click that button

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,249
if they see it that does protect an

252
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,868
apple from you know just somebody just

253
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:59,579
walking by or driving by and grabbing

254
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:01,769
credentials from a phone it just happens

255
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,508
to use an SSID and tries to connect so

256
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,040
that would protect you there but I'm

257
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,300
sure you give so little engineered well

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,498
your certificate expires you have to

259
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,649
teach all your Apple people to go

260
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:13,499
through and hit the button to redo it

261
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:14,730
Android and Windows carnem our helpdesk

262
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,740
yeah they don't do any of that by

263
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,999
default you can manually install the

264
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,360
cert but that's an extra step

265
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:24,269
I've got 14,000 students that have

266
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,860
sometimes can't follow the certificate

267
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,290
installation instruction is a very per

268
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,699
operating system because with Android

269
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,069
it's all over the place so it's really

270
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,729
bad so it's really only a partial

271
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,589
solution

272
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,420
the other challenge we've had is that

273
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,540
you corporate people like to lock your

274
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,229
machines down and so when those

275
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,209
employees that you're paying to take

276
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,649
credits from us come on campus they come

277
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,628
on with a laptop that we can't just sell

278
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:52,100
certs on to make it trust our network so

279
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:54,209
that's a challenge so eep TOS this is

280
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,410
it's secure but it's difficult to

281
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,149
support I think it's actually older than

282
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,129
peope it was like they're very one of

283
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,079
the first ones you need public key

284
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,600
infrastructure to generate and sign the

285
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,660
certificates Apple devices use it

286
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,309
profile and this we used to do this

287
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,170
method it worked really really well I

288
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,240
thought anyway the profile will get

289
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,410
installed bring in the certs do the

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,710
trust we could have a wipeout

291
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,480
like our of sign up SSID that worked

292
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,440
quite well windows and Android devices

293
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,480
are much more complicated they yeah

294
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,160
sometimes it lockdown by the enterprise

295
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,830
to bring it on and you can't get custom

296
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,439
certificates it's just kind of

297
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,790
problematic to get this to work it's

298
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,410
like when the oldest standard since

299
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,890
unfortunate that it's a pain to get it

300
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,050
to work

301
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,580
Android appeared to be all over the

302
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,709
place sometimes it would work on devices

303
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,990
you know work on Samsungs without LG's

304
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,960
or Samsung's would break all of a sudden

305
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:50,560
I know with my own phone which I've ran

306
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,820
a nexus it back then it during operating

307
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,410
system updates all of a sudden I would

308
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,930
just stop connecting to the network so

309
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,650
that's not fun it's not a good end user

310
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,000
experience incurs a very high cost what

311
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,949
am I being back here with this radius

312
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,980
certificate I guess I didn't mention is

313
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,680
that setting this up is really really

314
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,300
easy to do to speak by hand and so even

315
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,219
if you do have a process in place and

316
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,540
documentation or install or something

317
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,380
like that to get that certificate in

318
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,589
there so it's pinned

319
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,480
there's nothing guaranteeing that the

320
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,950
end user will do that every time because

321
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,200
all they get prompted for it is username

322
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,940
and password and another username and

323
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,440
theirs punch it in a way they go so you

324
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,090
aren't guarantee that you have a good

325
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,160
process to put that certain place that

326
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,630
that cert is in place so they'd only

327
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,740
trust the correct radio system unless

328
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,960
you have some sort of enterprise

329
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,970
management software on top of your

330
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:43,690
clients which once again we don't so

331
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,850
just talking about proxying

332
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,680
authentication this is a capture of a

333
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:53,890
map from canary which is your research

334
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,260
higher ed research group up here and all

335
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,600
these pins are an SSID that I can

336
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,850
connect to this is called a Jerome it's

337
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,850
kind of cool so ed Jerome is a giant

338
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,950
project with entities in 101 territories

339
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,360
basically countries that allows students

340
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,340
faculty and staff to connect to wireless

341
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,900
networks at other places so

342
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,550
theoretically I try to get it walking

343
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,810
past the University of Winnipeg and my

344
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,099
device didn't want to connect us I was

345
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,479
just walking past but theoretically I

346
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,310
can get on their network with whatever

347
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,410
permissions they give me using my NDSU

348
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,119
creds so what ends up happening is I'm

349
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,010
presenting that outer identity I give it

350
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,040
some baloney thing that says at NDSU the

351
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,069
edu

352
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,589
and it knows to route from here probably

353
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,120
up to the Canadian national probably up

354
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,950
to G Alan and then down to the US

355
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,190
national and then down into our radio

356
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:44,180
system as those proxies around it's

357
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:46,400
quite awesome it's it's great it's I was

358
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,069
able to grab Wireless in the airport to

359
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,449
of Oslo and museums in Europe and I had

360
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,940
really slow internet connection at my

361
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,080
air B&B and Riga and my phone was just

362
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,580
like bogging it down so I wouldn't find

363
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:01,040
a university and let's grab their

364
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:02,660
Wireless so the challenge with this and

365
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,520
with all these especially in higher

366
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,670
education is that we see lots and lots

367
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,439
and lots of devices we have about 11,000

368
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,680
devices connected to our network every

369
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,320
day that vary and from laptops to cell

370
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,359
phones to IOT devices to who knows what

371
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,830
and so just trying to figure out how to

372
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,180
manage all this is challenging and I'm

373
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:24,410
sure it's challenging for you guys as

374
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,099
well that's really all I got I don't

375
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,280
know how quickly I bless you that but

376
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,429
many questions thank you

377
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,429
[Applause]
