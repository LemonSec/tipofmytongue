little introduction so I've been about

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,230
20 years between IT and InfoSec my first

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,120
InfoSec job was third shift sock at a

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,870
financial in downtown Chicago

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,160
we ran a 24 by 7 sock with four people

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,099
and one floater

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,218
it was 12-hour shifts there was less to

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,870
do with in that original sock but um but

18
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,790
it was a great place to learn and I'm

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,468
glad I got the experience I'm also a

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:59,500

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,350
about Internet safety security and

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,149
ethics we have a big conference in

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,100
Chicago once a year and then we also

26
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:12,110

kids track so if you guys want to do a

28

run a kids track there as well I'm a

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,729
co-organizer of burb SEC and birbs tech

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,220
con will talk about what those things

33
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,259
are in a little bit

34
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,360
these are pin the opinions here are

35
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,869
either mine or especially those of other

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,369
researchers I'm put together yeah a lot

37
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,500
of good information from a lot of

38
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,509
sources here for you guys and do not

39
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,610
necessarily reflect the opinions of my

40
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,229
company my company would be an idiot if

41
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,009
they disagreed with me on any other slow

42
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,709
cuz it's great information many thanks

43
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,880
to the many people I've learned from

44
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:52,970
including Mike poor ed SCOTUS moob

45
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,920
xscape Kennedy Danny Harris Ryan kovar

46
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,130
Dave Herald and others they're all

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,080
fantastic people so my big claim to fame

48
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,839
though is really the dog that I taught

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,060
to ride motorcycle a few years back for

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,610
14 years he rode with me he passed away

51
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,170
a little while ago but that is that is

52
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,480
probably my best hack right there

53
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,250
anybody that loves positive

54
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,340
reinforcement Conditioning talked to me

55
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,920
and

56
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,580
I hear it works well on kids too so yeah

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,070
we'll see uh-huh anyway I put this deck

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,230
together ages ago and it was when I was

59
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,570
on the practitioner side and I put it

60
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,149
together because I ran into the problem

61
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,010
that I think everybody runs into right

62
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,250
it was always the same there was never

63
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,019
enough budget for for security to buy

64
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,209
everything they wanted to hire everyone

65
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,100
they wanted it would drive me crazy I'd

66
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,900
be like boss we need this new thing and

67
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,150
they'd be like yeah well budgets this

68
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,890
year's been spent come talk to us at the

69
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,720
next budget cycle and we'll see if we

70
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,489
can fix the problem now here in Winnipeg

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,620
because of a breach there is one company

72
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,910
that has all the budget they they can

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,320
stand right they have a blank check for

74
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,230
security you guys know who that is right

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,780
yeah it's nobody nobody has a blank

76
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,970
check for security right we all need a

77
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,310
little help there we need ways to fill

78
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,290
in those gaps so every time I went to a

79
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,850
hacker con I would and someone would say

80
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,350
and they would have stopped me if

81
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,850
they've just done this or this

82
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,769
particular thing would have solved this

83
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,780
problem I wrote it down put it in my

84
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,700
notebook and and I started finding that

85
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,989
a lot of these things if you go to a lot

86
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,040
of cons you've probably heard him them

87
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,780
before but many of them have been

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,700
forgotten or people didn't realize or

89
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,250
whatever so I've been asked to kind of

90
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,899
put together a defense on a budget kind

91
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,840
of presentation for folks that were in

92
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,280
the same position that I was in so over

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,930
and over again as I watched

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,180
high-performing teams as I worked with

95
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,700
other people and so what they were doing

96
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,100
at their companies I saw that focusing

97
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,109
on the primary security tool the one

98
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,090
that every company has was what made

99
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,830
those teams most effective and what is

100
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,100
the primary tool the one that every

101
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,260
company has yes it's you right

102
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,410
not to call you guys tools that's not

103
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,298
what I'm going for here but it is the

104
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,190
most important thing an honest to god I

105
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,370
mean I saw the merger of two companies

106
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,950
they were in the retail supply kind of

107
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,920
stuff two companies one I had a team of

108
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,839
seven one had a team of twenty five one

109
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,809
focused on their people one focused on

110
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,519
the the security tools that they bought

111
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,500
guess which team did a hell of a lot

112
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,060
better you have the small one that's

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,798
because those guys were constantly

114
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,150
teaching each other challenging each

115
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,820
other they taught each other how to

116
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,000
script hacked whatever so leveling your

117
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,550
people up that's key

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,970
who here hates this Venn diagram yeah

119
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,160
right this diagram sucks and why cuz it

120
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,690
never looks like this right we forget

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,670
about process right off their frickin

122
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,860
bat we forget about our people probably

123
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,560
second and usually we end up dumping

124
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,330
things in technology instead right so

125
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,950
what happens what happens to this Venn

126
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,270
diagram everything's dumped in

127
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,219
technology and you forget about your

128
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,099
people in your process yeah it looks

129
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,350
like this and this is a bad state for

130
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,050
security you do not want a Mickey Mouse

131
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,880
organization is your security dear so

132
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,680
how do we level up people let's talk

133
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,090
about people right so I don't have to

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,710
tell you guys but one of the best ways

135
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,429
is at a freaking hacker conference right

136
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,859
yeah who your love sans I mean I love

137
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,200
sans it's a great organization fantastic

138
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,300
right but we would constantly get that

139
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,680
well three of you can go this year and

140
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,110
three of you can go now you're right

141
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,020
yeah cuz it's not cheap sans is awesome

142
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,640
but it's expensive so in between we

143
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,560
would try and start going hacker cons

144
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,840
and honestly between being either free

145
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,960
or very cheap you can send your entire

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,940
staff to several hacker cons for the

147
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,590
price of one sans class and if you're

148
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,169
not if you're there any managers in here

149
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,289
you're pissing your money away because

150
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:42,120
so if anybody minds they like the

151
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,550
lighter swear words please just say hell

152
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:50,610
yeah I hate that and okay good

153
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:53,070
we're okay all right oh so so managers

154
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,290
are showing up at hacker con CISOs

155
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,669
higher tier managers and it's because

156
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,140
there's so much good information being

157
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,380
shared I know I don't have to convince

158
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,780
this crowd but but it's it's worthwhile

159
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,969
the burbs tech community that I talked

160
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,830
about in Chicago if you if not here in

161
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,479
Winnipeg gets great but if you're not

162
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,310
from Winnipeg and you're in a city where

163
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,159
there isn't one we've come up with a

164
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,320
zero effort formula for putting on your

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,300
own hacker con and in fact we chastise

166
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,770
each other if we put in too much effort

167
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,520
so what we feel is pretty basic we've

168
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:29,010
gone to open mic instead of a CFP it's

169
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,020
bring your own badge we get a bar that

170
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,180
pretty much lets us run it all on just

171
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,099
what we can sell through concessions

172
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,390
which I think this is same here right I

173
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,640
think that's the way they set it up as

174
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,210
well so if you want to chat about how to

175
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,068
run your

176
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,310
zero effort hacker con in your neck of

177
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:46,319
the woods let me know in addition the

178
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,560
burp set community itself is a great

179
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,449
great tool it started up as the same

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,630
thing with all the city sex that started

181
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,400
up starting in the mid 2000s I know that

182
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,880
Edmonton has like YAG sack has anybody

183
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,789
been to yank out in Edmonton so the idea

184
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,860
is simple put together a regular meet up

185
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,020
once a month that's unlike all the other

186
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,449
ones ISACA eyes to say all that stuff is

187
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,789
formal and it's lovely but it doesn't

188
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,099
allow people the information share like

189
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:17,009
like these meetups do so for the price

190
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,500
of a beer I've learned so much from my

191
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,789
red teaming friends right I and first of

192
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,979
all I know that most of them are bored

193
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,630
our freaking minds cuz there is no

194
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,180
challenge out there they're getting this

195
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,830
in the same way over and over again they

196
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,449
don't have to vary their tactics they

197
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,820
fish in a little bit drop a couple tools

198
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,349
domain admin by the end of the day maybe

199
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,940
by the end of the week at the most

200
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,560
so if that's how they're getting in and

201
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,630
this is for you blue teamers if you

202
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,460
don't know how they're getting in go and

203
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,740
drink beer with the freakin red teamers

204
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,359
and talk to them because they will tell

205
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,830
you and beers a great way to get them to

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,340
tell you - it's a great lubricant for

207
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,590
information right um so again the

208
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,659
formula is simple if you don't have your

209
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,489
own regular monthly meetup find three

210
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,830
people at least from three different

211
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,840
organizations um put it up on meetup

212
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,280
comm or whatever and it's three people

213
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,469
from three different organizations so

214
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,539
that if you have a dumpster fire at one

215
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,250
there's always someone else that can

216
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,080
show up and the job of those three

217
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,000
people is simple you remind the bar that

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,758
you're showing up that day and then you

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
you make sure you say hi to all the new

220
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,900
people that come making people feel

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,159
welcome and comfortable is the key to

222
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,539
the success of all of this

223
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,880
people come in you're like hey you're

224
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,740
here for for whinnies whinny sack or

225
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,659
something like that um they come in and

226
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,750
if the community just grows from there

227
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:32,520
and it's fantastic um in addition start

228

so that's how to level ourselves up

244
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,880
how'd about those four-letter words

245
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,100
called users right so I got this from

246
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,950
Ben 10 Ben's fabulous you can see his

247
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,370
whole video on this presentation from

248
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,380
Derby con like 2012 2013 whenever the

249
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,790
song Gangnam style was popular because

250
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,360
he used it in his video yeah that's

251
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,670
hilarious

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,250
watch it it's super funny but to

253
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,469
nutshell it he said instead of showing

254
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,510
people those god-awful videos the ones

255
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,060
you'd rather rub glass in your eyes than

256
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,730
actually watch about security awareness

257
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,709
why not gamify it why not turn it into

258
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,790
something fun for the users that'll make

259
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,370
them learn that'll make them pay

260
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,680
attention again concept was simple

261
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,290
hey company we're gonna have a security

262
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,390
awareness competition there's gonna be

263
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,829
security related things I'm not gonna

264
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,839
tell you what those things are maybe you

265
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,550
shouldn't watch the videos but in any

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,320
event the first person that reports any

267
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,420
one of those things the first need of

268
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,670

bucks he had people by the middle of the

275

278
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,350

279
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,880
wearing their badge because it was

280
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,560
against me right yeah cuz it's against

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,839
policy hey that's a security thing I'm

282
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,579
somebody else reported a very strange

283
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,000
black box outside of one of the side

284
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,440
doors

285
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,630
it was rodent control box but yeah but

286
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
the best part really happened about 15

287
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,439
minutes into his competition he gets a

288
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
call from a very excited woman she's

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,720
like hey hey I seen one of your things

290
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,489
and he says no what things

291
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,140
she's like the security things like you

292
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,180
said what the stuff and the things and

293
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,550
he's like all right we haven't started

294
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,170
yet what are you seeing and she said

295
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,180
well this thing keeps popping up on my

296
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,610
computer that says you know click here

297
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,089
for authorization I like this I don't

298
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:03,329
know and after he removed his hand from

299
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:05,100
his face he said how long have you been

300
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,790
seeing this war Oh Lex

301
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,770
six weeks now yeah they had a real

302
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,750
security incident 15 minutes into the

303
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,819
competition he turned his people into

304
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,340
carbon based intrusion detection sensors

305
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,990
and it was fabulous now the one thing

306
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,940
Ben doesn't know so I've talked about

307
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,350
this with other folks and somebody came

308
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,390
up to me once and they said yeah we

309
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,940
tried this at our organization and it

310
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,280
worked great for the first couple of

311
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,140
weeks and I'm like okay and then what

312
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,300
happened they're like well some of our

313
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,130
users got very overzealous and they

314
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,240
started downloading things like necess

315
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,689
so that they could scan for

316
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,550
vulnerabilities and report and report

317
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,380
them to the organization right now

318
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,969
what's the real problem with that story

319
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,560
what the hell are they doing being

320
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,050
allowed to download necess and run it on

321
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,410
the systems right um but but yeah

322
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,630
barring some overzealous users this can

323
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,250
be a very effective way to actually make

324
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,439
your people get involved with security

325
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,360
instead of just hating security so

326
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,620
highly recommend it Thank You Ben for

327
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,890
this one

328
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,590
all right so Emmett who here has

329
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,360
actually heard of Emmett yeah or so so

330
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:12,030
it's of the window your windows admins

331
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,420
should know about it it's designed to

332
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,819
protect the memory of apps on systems

333
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,530
that you deploy it on do not just

334
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,990
install and it turn on it will break

335
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,689
 all over your network it's terrible

336
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,100
but if you can tweak it if you can get

337
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,960
it running right if you can get those

338
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,250
apps that need to be protected running

339
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,810
under it prop usually probably on

340
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,420
servers I don't know how well it's gonna

341
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,310
work in the user space it can do a

342
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,770
pretty good job things like rock chains

343
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,239
will bypass it yeah um people have

344
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,770
mentioned yeah but it went end-of-life

345
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,180
July 2018 true if you're completely on

346
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,400
wind ten I mean completely like

347
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,430
everything and what does every ATM in

348
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,510
North America still freakin run on yeah

349
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,939
X freaking P oh my god so there's still

350
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,620
plenty of places to leverage it um it

351
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,930
will reduce the number of tools an

352
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,360
attacker can use and that's helpful you

353
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,209
will have to test and in tests not in

354
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
production people test and test yeah I

355
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,240
know we don't have to tell you guys that

356
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,189
but for the IT admins say I'll pass it

357
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:17,070
along so well hi

358
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,209
why are passwords the bane of our

359
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,399
existence

360
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:22,279
all right this drives us well this is

361
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,829
our weakest link this drives us crazy

362
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,439
passwords are so effed up right and and

363
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,449
and and why I mean it's it's an easy

364
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:32,730
problem solved the real solution here is

365
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:35,160
what it's two-factor multi-factor right

366
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,800
two-factor multi-factor solves a lot of

367
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,319
evil it stops a lot of attackers in

368
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,969
their tracks but it's not free

369
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,709
so I can't say it's a free thing you can

370
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,019
use there's an open source one called

371
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,459
Aussie to date I haven't met anyone

372
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,439
who's deployed it at the enterprise

373
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,508
level maybe can leverage it a little bit

374
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,368
for like your privileged users admins

375
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,929
stuff like that but yeah not only do we

376
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,610
not use our same password for banking

377
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,199
and Twitter how many folks think that

378
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,540
they have maybe a domain admin that came

379
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,519
up with a fantastic password like 24

380
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,679
characters random string took him two

381
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,449
weeks to memorize it and then when they

382
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,829
went to go set up their Home Depot

383
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:14,429
account and needed a secure password

384
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:15,839
they're like oh yeah yeah not good so to

385
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:17,670
explain all of this and why it's a

386
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,339
problem who's here has seen the xkcd

387
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,549
cartoon yeah why did it take a frickin

388
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,399
cartoon to explain the CISOs why this is

389
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,679
bad right why why saying oh hey take a

390
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,829
word and replace a couple of letters

391
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,990
with numbers is so crappy so at this

392
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,049
point this cartoon is about eight years

393
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,939
old roughly so eight years ago it took

394
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:42,389
about three days for a password cracking

395
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:44,879
rig to to break this most of my people

396
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:47,670
that ain't no running GPU rigs to crack

397
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,939
passwords are saying like minutes maybe

398
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,949
a couple hours tops

399
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:54,599
whereas eight years ago something like a

400
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:56,670
password phrase something like correct

401
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,920
car's battery staple was far more

402
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:02,279
powerful far more entropy in this

403
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,589
password so forty four bits roughly and

404
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,379
five hundred fifty years to guess I'm

405
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,600
being told still maybe a couple days

406
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,699
tops for this but that's okay because

407
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,170
you take this and throw in a couple

408
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,878
extra special characters and number

409
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,160
something like that the entropy is gonna

410
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,379
skyrocket on this so password phrases

411
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,629
until we can get something like to

412
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:25,049
factor in will solve a lot of problems

413
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,910
in addition key passes free maybe it's

414
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,339
not for all your users a lot a lot of

415
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,339
people that aren't really IT minded have

416
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,780
a hard time with password vaults

417
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,760
again you're privileged users your

418
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,680
admins should be able to handle it I've

419
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,120
had arguments with my um right red

420
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,000
teaming friends they're like yeah yeah

421
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,460
but if i hack into someone's system if I

422
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,170
fish onto a an admin and he's running a

423
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,310
vault then I have all those passwords

424
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,130
anyway because it's right there on the

425
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,959
system and I'm like yeah but if I sneak

426
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,730
in with the smokers and I find their one

427
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,790
password that's on a sticky note under

428
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,590
the keyboard I still have them so this

429
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,390
is all about risk mitigation or risk

430
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,160
acceptance most people I know say

431
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,720
password vault certainly better than

432
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,280
nothing certainly better than a single

433
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,200
password used throughout the entire

434
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,689
organization and if you can get your

435
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,250
users using it for themselves as well to

436
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,140
protect their own accounts we're

437
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:17,480
starting to turn them into again better

438
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:19,819
security people so ah job yeah oh my

439
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,490
freaking God so who here still has Java

440
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,980
6 running somewhere in the organization

441
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,870
yes so for those of you that didn't

442
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,600
raise your hands either you're too

443
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:32,810
embarrassed to say it or even worse you

444
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,370
don't know cuz it is there I guarantee

445
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,920
you if you're in an organization of any

446
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:40,190
size whatsoever it is there lurking

447
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,209
somewhere in the back office because and

448
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,460
the reason is always the same

449
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,260
it's always because it is driving some

450
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,110
mission-critical thing that makes the

451
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,760
company all the money that they have

452
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,400
somebody wrote it 10 years ago the

453
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,310
developer died and no one knows how to

454
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,630
fix it it's a cell or they don't want to

455
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,670
pay for it to be fixed but usually

456
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:03,380
they're dead so um so um so we have to

457
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,450
deal with all Java and as we know old

458
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,760
Java if it goes on the Internet at all

459
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,920
you're done you're owned already so a

460
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,859
lot of people don't know is that every

461
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Java installation every year

462
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:17,419
installation on a workstation has a user

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,329
agent string and you can block that Java

464
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,310
user agent string at the proxy so that

465
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,770
it doesn't talk to the internet that the

466
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,780
only thing it can talk to is that old

467
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,120
ass Java app that's running somewhere in

468
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,889
the back office now black tops are a

469
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,449
problem right laptops go outside the

470
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,760
proxy you're gonna have to either back

471
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,650
all those things or you're gonna have to

472
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,750
do something like put in a GPO that says

473
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,700
went off the corporate network Java

474
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,550
doesn't run both of those would mitigate

475
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,580
the the mobile laptops and things like

476
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,550
that

477
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,980
so stopping Java don't let it talk get

478
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:54,300
rid of it eventually but for now this is

479
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:57,570
a good mitigation na so yes so this is a

480
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,060
list of every executable extension that

481
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,590
should be blocked at the gateway and I

482
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,270
want you guys to block each and every

483
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,300
frickin one of these all of them

484
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,040
seriously just do it now know what

485
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,260
you're gonna say you're say oh but

486
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,480
Robert maybe maybe I have some users

487
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,150
that might need their dot NWS extension

488
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,610
or whatever the Frick that is right um

489
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,200
to which I say if Apple can tell us we

490
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,389
can do without a headset jacket we're

491
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,400
just gonna deal with it yeah then we can

492
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,640
tell our users that they don't get their

493
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,770
extensions now if there is there's gonna

494
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,650
be some exceptions have a really robust

495
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,690
really fast to an act exception policy

496
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,880
so when a few people that actually have

497
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,010
a legit need for one of these asks for

498
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,630
it you can put it in place fine we got

499
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,570
you it's these eight people they need

500
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:46,500
this extension done for everybody else

501
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:49,409
no no more WMS for you for Frick sake so

502
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,630
booty Murtagh spot.com maintains this

503
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,550
list it's it's good stuff and this will

504
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,710
this won't get rid a lot of low-hanging

505
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,419
fruit this will stop a lot of bad

506
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:02,970
coming into your into your environment

507
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:05,850
ah so antivirus yeah it's almost useless

508
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,770
right it doesn't do a whole lot for us

509
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,780
but it's not completely useless we can

510
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,480
still leverage it for some things every

511
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,230
major antivirus vendor out there pretty

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,340
much allows you to leverage the tool to

513
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,920
go scanning for indicators of

514
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,209
compromised so if you take this you know

515
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,430
stuff that's coming through your gateway

516
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,390
like this you drop that into kuku or yar

517
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,390
or something like that

518
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,580
extract the ifcs you can now use your AV

519
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,590
to go looking for those things cuz it's

520
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,120
out there already anyway right because

521
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,699
of the auditors and compliance you've

522
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,469
got a V on just about everything why not

523
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,260
leverage it now could you do this with

524
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,280
like your your phone screen or -

525
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,110
absolutely as long as your phone

526
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,879
scanners authenticating to everything

527
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,050
right if you're not doing authenticated

528
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,990
well if you're not doing authenticated

529
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,510
scans they should be doing move to a

530
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:55,020
different company because because

531
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:57,540
they're doing it wrong but but in

532
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,360
addition heuristics often turned off at

533
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,540
a lot of organs

534
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,120
I suspect because heuristics can be

535
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,950
really noisy and it's gonna make more

536
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,889
work for the IT folks as they try to

537
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,780
tweak that noise but it can still find

538
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,340
some things you know it was the first

539
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,889
attempt to find malicious code without a

540
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,679
signature it can still be effective it

541
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,320
can still find stuff out there in your

542
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,090
organization worth looking into and then

543
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,250
last but not least so made my red team

544
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,080
friends have said yeah you know what av

545
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,780
was running it actually fired on me I

546
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,929
saw it in the logs but nobody was

547
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,820
checking nobody checked the logs to see

548
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,120
if anything was going on so simply

549
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:41,080
having a way to alert on the AV might be

550
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,179
effective oh good ok so this next part

551
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,850
got a lot of these from Rubik a lot of

552
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,870
these from Mike poor the whole idea if

553
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,490
it for those you're not familiar you

554
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,399
think some people call them land mines

555
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,860
honey tokens Canaries there's all sorts

556
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,690
of different ways to refer these but the

557
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,000
whole idea behind all of these is to

558
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,410
trick the attacker into letting you know

559
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,210
that they're there without him even

560
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,440
knowing that they that you know that

561
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,640
they're there maybe they know that you

562
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,840
know but by that time it doesn't matter

563
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,210
cuz you've already got them

564
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,189
so concept is simple the simplest one

565
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,770
something like a honey file you get

566
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,720
together with your IT admins you put a

567
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,070
hidden file in the golden image you

568
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,230
deploy it throughout the entire

569
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,360
organization whitelist it from

570
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,150
everything that might touch that file

571
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,729
and then you alert on that one thing

572
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,490
it's not perfect but it allows you to

573
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,170
monitor the entire organization for

574
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,870
untoward things happening out there

575
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,940
without having to log the frickin world

576
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,100
just one log

577
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,230
now some user drop into the command

578
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,969
prompt and run in der /s that's gonna

579
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,710
fire that off for sure but how many

580
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,210
when's the last time you saw user doing

581
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,890
anything from the command line right I

582
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,430
mean they just it doesn't happen that

583
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,230
much anymore so great way to start the

584
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:53,350
second one's even better better fidelity

585
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,720
you create at you you get your domain

586
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,179
admins to Crane an account and you call

587
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,450
that do something like domain admin

588
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:04,390
whatever you trick the attackers into

589
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,700
thinking you are the dumbest MCSE that's

590
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,010
ever lived because you're gonna put the

591
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,720
password in the description itself in

592
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,820
the description of that account is going

593
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,040
to be o in the

594
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,100
right attacker sees that he's like oh

595
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,290
these idiots they're so ond yeah

596
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,469
but not so much we're gonna alert again

597
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,210
on just this one little tiny thing this

598
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,820
account being used somewhere in the

599
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,340
domain if that that happens you've

600
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,990
either got evil in the network or you've

601
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,100
got someone that really wants to get to

602
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,179
those cat videos that you've been

603
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,300
blocking and they're trying to get

604
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:39,280
domain admin yeah so make like an hour

605
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,950
zero but in the admin group very

606
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,660
effective but let's go a little more

607
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,179
effective definitely got this one from

608
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,690
Mike poor are there any DBA is in the

609
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,000
room

610
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,490
I'll think out there such prima donnas

611
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,860
right we cannot put anything on their

612
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,110
systems for monitoring and it drives me

613
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,790
crazy so instead of you know what your

614
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,709
database access monitoring all that

615
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,690
stuff really expensive but something

616
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,730
like a honey table or a honey file

617
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,590
pretty cheap pretty easy you get

618
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,480
together with one of the DBA is maybe

619
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,820
two at the most so there you have a you

620
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,770
know a backup and you create a hidden

621
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,750
file I mean a hidden database or a

622
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,700
hidden table call it something juicy

623
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,050
call it credit cards call it something

624
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,490
that someone would probably want to

625
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,379
steal from your organization if you're

626
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,500
working at Pharma you know call it

627
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,750
formulary whatever and then simply alert

628
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,090
on anybody touching that table or

629
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,500
touching that database if anybody and

630
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,300
you don't publish in any schema right

631
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,980
nobody should know about it you get

632
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,690
anybody touching that someone's either

633
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,820
trying to steal your data or you have a

634
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,160
DBA that needs to go back to remedial

635
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,020
DBA school because they just did a

636
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,309
select star from everything in your

637
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,160
frickin environment right that's the

638
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:47,379
only way that's getting it so so good

639
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,360
one there and then this last one I love

640
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,100
this last one beautiful beautiful in its

641
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,870
simplicity

642
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:56,709
this has invoke run as you can get it

643
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,510
from github you you deploy it with sec

644
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,150
m2 all of your workstations and laptops

645
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,610
all it does is it loads a fake set of

646
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,440
creds into memory so that's something

647
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,389
that tries to scrape creds out of memory

648
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,690
like me me cats or something like that

649
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,160
we'll grab that set of creds alert

650
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,750
simply on the use of that set of

651
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,260
credentials which use the credentials to

652
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,460
nothing right and now this is not likely

653
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,350
to get a false positive

654
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,290
if you users are downloading me me cats

655
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,540
you've got way bigger problems yeah so

656
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,670
so great way to catch them

657
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,740
more advanced attacks going on again

658
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,530
without without having to really do a

659
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,450
whole lot I'm just you I t's gonna have

660
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,740
to work with you a little bit but you

661
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:40,900
should be able to at least social

662
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:42,370
engineer min to that right yeah so a

663
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,380
couple other quick ways to stop

664
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,060
attackers in their tracks having a

665
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,370
webform

666
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,200
that requires users to log in just once

667
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,979
a day when they first get to work you

668
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,050
know log in authenticate to the proxy

669
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,460
sometimes you know Mobile's even

670
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:01,090
suggested that some places might want to

671
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,860
have users to go so far as asking the

672
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,260
user the first user to go to a

673
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,750
particular site for that day to allow

674
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,970
that site so a pop-up comes up says is

675
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,860
it okay to go to the site doesn't matter

676
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,630
if the user gets it right or wrong it's

677
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,340
just simply something that's gonna stop

678
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,870
some sort of automated script because

679
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,929
it's not going to know how to answer you

680
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:22,330
know how to respond to this pop-up in

681
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,890
addition there's a vulnerability and BB

682
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,800
pad that allows for man in middling

683
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,960
these two simple null routes mitigate

684
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,930
that that issue stopped men and meddling

685
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,560
in addition as part of this I want you

686
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:38,410
to disable NetBIOS I know it's just like

687
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,419
the freaking extensions right it's been

688
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,060
there forever you can't get rid of it

689
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,400
but it needs to be on your plan there

690
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,870
should or security five year ten I don't

691
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,720
care how many years it's gonna take you

692
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,510
but it needs to be part of the plan

693
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,670
getting rid of NetBIOS period it allows

694
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,070
so much evil right over it for those of

695
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,170
you the red teamers how easy does you

696
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,500
know NetBIOS make your life when land

697
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,540
man hasn't been set up properly and even

698
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,760
if you're gonna use a tool say like

699
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,490
responder who hears heard of responder

700
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,510
yeah right great great red team tool

701
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,730
it's one of the first ones they'll

702
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,040
download and if you're running NetBIOS

703
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,680
they'll fire that up and it will listen

704
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,409
for a NetBIOS broadcast and as soon as

705
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,450
it hears one it goes yes that is me

706
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,040
give me your hash give me I'll take care

707
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,620
of everything for you it's all cool it's

708
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,260
great in the meanwhile if your password

709
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,340
is freaking summer 2019 or whatever and

710
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:38,260
yeah you're dead so um so get rid of

711
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,550
NetBIOS seriously it's it's gotta go so

712
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,920
also disabled

713
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:45,010
DNS on internal name servers for

714
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,990
external namespace another good tactic

715
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,060
to get stop automated scripts and

716
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,740
automated malware your internal name

717
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,899
servers do not need to be doing forward

718
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,640
lookups let the proxy do that this great

719
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,100
proxy that we're causing forcing people

720
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,830
authenticate once a day anyway

721
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,080
and and make it harder for especially

722
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,439
automated tools to resolve the things

723
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,840
that they need to get to on the outside

724
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,450
more a box so Catherine mentioned laps

725
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,010
earlier guess what I hear I'm talking

726
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,950
about it too it's important who hears

727
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:17,020
heard of laps yeah who hears using laps

728
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,360
is it working pretty well for anybody

729
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,150
that's using a shout-out yeah fantastic

730
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,879
this is something Microsoft did right

731
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:28,840
that's a really weird thing to say right

732
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,120
but but it's it works i'm solution not

733
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,550
familiar with it if you still have local

734
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,169
admin which is another problem right we

735
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,899
need to get rid of that local admin like

736
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:40,150
NetBIOS but if you have a local admin

737
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,520
out in the environment it randomizes the

738
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,980
local admin password for every system

739
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,170
that has a local admin which stops the

740
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,820
attacker from pivoting from one system

741
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,850
to the next to the next just losing

742
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,340
local admin really really a good

743
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,110
mitigation highly recommended if you've

744
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,470
got local admin out there and then this

745
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:02,500
last one this last one is great it's so

746
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,710
simple this is just a GPO this is a GPO

747
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,380
that says allow or disallow connections

748
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,400
to this workstation or a laptop from the

749
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,560
network to turn it off on everything

750
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:26,080
yeah so IT people might need to connect

751
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:28,870
to yo yeah ok what is the name of that

752
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,939
DLL ok so he's saying that there's a

753
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:40,419
special deal all you have to deploy to

754
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:42,010
get it to work properly with laps ok and

755
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,540
it's also storing information on the

756
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,280
object so if you have an evil admin

757
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,300
you're leaving yourself open to that

758
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:52,060
sort of attack is that right ok

759
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,379
fantastic thank you for that so and then

760
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,929
yes so this GPS

761
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,080
deny access to the system from the

762
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:00,640
network if I T really needs to get to

763
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,980
that system they're freaking IT they can

764
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,410
flip the GPO to allow themselves remote

765
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,390
access but in the meantime with this

766
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,640
deployed this stops some of the best

767
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,770
attackers I know from moving laterally

768
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,970
they might get onto one machine but they

769
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,170
won't be able to get on the next one

770
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,760
they're gonna have to fish their way in

771
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,040
and fish their way in it and keep

772
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,030
pivoting that way or through some other

773
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,139
means right I mean if there's

774
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,149
vulnerabilities out there they can

775
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,770
leverage those whatever but they can't

776
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,410
just connect from one machine to another

777
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,500
using living off the land tactics and

778
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:31,210
scraping credits and things like that

779
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,700
what about the logs Robert so I work for

780
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,730
Splunk so assumably I should have some

781
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,670
good tips and tricks on logs right sure

782
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,350
so we've got past the hash obviously on

783
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,510
the decline right people are using other

784
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,399
ways to get throughout the organization

785
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,310
but there's still a good search for pass

786
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,020
the hash whether it's been in use now or

787
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,669
you could actually go historically and

788
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,430
see if you've had that problem before

789
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,140
pretty good fidelity on this one easily

790
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,970
Google belitz it's out there on the

791
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,410
internet and I mean it's not like you

792
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,970
need Splunk you could freaking do this

793
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,410
with grep it doesn't matter

794
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,800
[Music]

795
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:08,230
so DNS is a great place to go looking

796
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,870
for evil attackers tend to leave a lot

797
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,760
of finger prints in DNS so if we wanted

798
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,530
to simply just find unauthorized DNS

799
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,940
within the network these are three

800
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,770
different searches they're all the same

801
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,090
thing it's just depending on where

802
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,670
you're getting your data from is it

803
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:25,480
coming from bro / Zeke or is it coming

804
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,610
from packet capture like stream or if if

805
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,900
you're tagging all of your log sources

806
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,050
you can use tag

807
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,580
in addition finding DNS spoofing

808
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,399
activity on the network

809
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,169
another quick search for that the second

810
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,120
one finding clients connecting to

811
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,590
multiple and DNS servers one of my

812
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,989
teammates came up with this one this is

813
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,389
great well this is this is clever

814
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,880
because by default how many DNS servers

815
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,620
does any host know about

816
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,270
yeah only two right I mean there you

817
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,639
might have some interesting round-robin

818
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,020
e of DNS but other than that if you've

819
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,550
got hosts couldn't and you could

820
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,410
whitelist those if you've got hosts

821
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,330
collecting connected to multiple DNS

822
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,090
servers that's someone doing something

823
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,770
weird right that's not your systems or

824
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,540
your users doing that so another great

825
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,250
- just find indications of evil out on

826
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,040
the network

827
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,140
finding extremely long DNS queries which

828
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,250
could be indicative of live data

829
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:21,050
exfiltration right 53 is wide open and

830
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,380
there's some quick and easy ways you can

831
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,820
look for data ex Ville either two

832
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,650
standard deviations or two hundred

833
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,750
characters long these aren't magic

834
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,280
numbers by the way right it's a place to

835
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,560
start you're gonna have to tweak it

836
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,899
within your organization but just simply

837
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,520
looking for extraordinarily long queries

838
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,290
in the organization you can be

839
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,900
indicative and if you're getting a lot

840
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:44,240
of extremely long DNS queries I'd say

841
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,280
almost 9% of time that's gonna be Dan

842
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,800
exfil of some sort you might have some

843
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:53,629
weird processes doing that but it's not

844
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:56,899
common so entropy can also be used to

845
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,550
look for kind of usually command and

846
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,460
control kind of things so if there's a

847
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:04,129
lot of entropy in the DNS query it's

848
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,320
often either you know CDN you know like

849
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,090
Akamai or it's gonna be some sort of

850
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,689
command and control channel so you can

851
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,610
measure Shannon entropy spunk has a free

852
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:17,390
toolkit called the UI toolkit you can

853
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,760
download you can use other math kits as

854
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:23,140
well that'll measure Shannon entropy but

855
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,600
this this low score and for google.com

856
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:30,200
2.6 is pretty low if you if you see a

857
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,270
longer random string like this 4.28 is

858
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,800
going to be the Shannon of that Shannon

859
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,080
entropy of that string which is

860
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,470
extraordinarily high in entropy math so

861
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,590
simply measuring the entropy of your

862
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,180
queries will give you something that

863
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,220
looks like this as far as the search

864
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,170
goes we can start measuring the entropy

865
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,210
to filter out the CD ends you're

866
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,370
probably gonna want to wait list for the

867
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,990
search something like the Alexa 5

868
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,149
million 10 million somewhere around

869
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,130
there that would get rid of your CD ends

870
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,870
and your legitimate websites and it'll

871
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,030
leave you something that looks more like

872
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,530
this so all of these really long random

873
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,440
strings here that no humans ever gonna

874
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:10,460
type in they're all popping entropy of

875
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,900
like 4.4 and higher I would find all of

876
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,210
these suspect and want to figure out

877
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,340
what the heck they were and and what

878
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:20,360
what's actually being called out to over

879
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,010
DNS oh yeah so ogre

880
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,750
they're free from the fun we can have

881
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,370
with algorithms machine learnings all

882
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,020
the right everybody wants to sell

883
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,219
you their machine learning stuff yeah

884
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,799
you don't need to buy anything to get

885
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,299
started it's pretty easy so there's a

886
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,090
couple different ways you can do it

887
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:38,450
our is a good one you can use Sipe I

888
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,939
along with Matt plot library two to do

889
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,320
this as well and spunk has a free

890
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,790
developer's license and they're machine

891
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,610
learning toolkit can do it as well you

892
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,649
don't have to buy anything to start

893
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,209
doing stuff with algorithms and it can

894
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,330
be helpful so to show you a great

895
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,880
experiment we did we went to the Center

896
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:59,030
for Medicare and Medicaid that's our sad

897
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,960
excuse for medical free medical care for

898
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,928
the US right

899
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,280
yeah but the cool thing is is you can

900
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:06,140
come over here to research and

901
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,359
statistics and you can download a heck

902
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,250
of a lot of data because since it's

903
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,109
government paid that has to be records

904
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,780
of it that are open to the public so you

905
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:16,790
can do things like download all of the

906
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,230
prescriptions for Medicare Medicaid

907
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,300
patients from 2015

908
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,949
now it's hip us so it's anonymize you

909
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,109
don't know the name of the person that

910
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:26,509
received the prescription but you know

911
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:28,100
pretty much everything else you know who

912
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,649
wrote it where it was written what it

913
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,480
was written for lots and lots of data to

914
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,730
play with and so we thought well let's

915
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,500
see what we can find just throw in some

916
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,490
algorithms at it and looking for

917
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,649
outliers so we downloaded 2015's

918
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:44,418
prescriptions and we also filtered it

919
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,279
out for just opioid prescriptions

920
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,469
thinking there might be something

921
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,020
interesting there right and then this

922
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:52,908
this graph DC is the result of just two

923
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,770
algorithms being run so the first

924
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:56,149
algorithm is called PCA and again it's

925
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,690
part of the Python kit for scientific

926
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:02,299
computing you can easily average in PCA

927
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:05,180
you use it to say hey PCA see all these

928
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,369
fields all these data points I want you

929
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:10,129
to take all of the data and reduce it

930
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:12,140
down to numbers that basically indicate

931
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,460
the the three most significant you don't

932
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,859
have to tell me what those are I don't

933
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,690
care just reduce it down to X number we

934
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:19,640
chose three because you can plot three

935
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,130
on the 3d graph so this is the result of

936
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,560
PCA here and then you run those results

937
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,950
into k-means which is a clustering

938
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,480
algorithm so everything now and ends up

939
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,890
being you know Sesame Street math after

940
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,810
that which of these things are not like

941
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,310
the other so you've got a nice cluster

942
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,200
of prescriptions here

943
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,850
and then you've got these outliers now I

944
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,310
don't know why they're outliers at first

945
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:42,470
but if we start googling like googling

946
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:45,680
these providers you'll find that John

947
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:49,069
couch here is in jail for 240 months for

948
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,690
prescription fraud yeah now how could

949
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,370
you be leveraging this one here in your

950
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,470
own organization right this is a great

951
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,690
way to find if you can solve one fraud

952
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,000
problem if your company does anything

953
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,070
with like web transactions money

954
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,820
anything like that and we've even helped

955
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,440
gaming companies find fraud like people

956
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,790
taking stolen credit cards buying an

957
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,860
account selling that account to someone

958
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,170
else for less than the account normally

959
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,210
would and all of that weirdness will

960
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,400
show up like this I'm one of these other

961
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,750
outliers if we were to scroll a little

962
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,910
further down

963
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,230
ok now John came up because he was

964
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,870
writing a lot of prescriptions that's

965
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,640
why he was an outlier another doctor

966
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,609
that's a bit further down ended up being

967
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,609
an outlier because he was a pediatrician

968
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:34,360
and I don't know too many two-year-olds

969
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:37,370
that need oxycontin on a regular basis

970
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:41,330
although every time I fly I wish there

971
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:43,130
was more doctors like those ever so and

972
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,960
he wasn't giving the drugs to the kids

973
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,570
right I mean he was wrecking him for the

974
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,880
kid but mom or dad was the one actually

975
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:52,610
taking the drugs also in jail for

976
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,160
prescription fraud by the way so the

977
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:57,050
stuff like this is really useful and you

978
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,270
guys can leverage tons of free tools to

979
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,040
find stuff and swear to God you solve

980
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:04,580
one fraud problem your company your

981
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,080
budgets going up I guarantee it so it's

982
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,220
a lot of good information that I've

983
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,290
pulled together hopefully for you

984
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,810
hopefully you get to take at least one

985
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:13,550
of these back home and try it but put it

986
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:17,650
to good use because remember that only

987
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:20,470
you can stop InfoSec dumpster fires

988
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:23,900
thanks very much

989
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,899
