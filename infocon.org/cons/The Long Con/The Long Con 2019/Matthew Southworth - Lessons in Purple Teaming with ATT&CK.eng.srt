1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:15,139
I love Winnipeg especially this time of

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:23,060
year this is the only day in the year I

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:25,609
wake up feeling rested so who has ever

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,369
done a pen test who's ever been on the

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:31,609
other side of a pen test who knows what

6
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:35,269
the mitre attack framework is hey hands

7
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,829
great so I have done this presentation a

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,600
few times with my friend and colleague

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:43,750
Daniel who wants to do it Wiley's

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,420
externa

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:53,210
unfortunately I couldn't convince him to

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:55,550
come to Winnipeg so he's dead to us I am

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,500
on the security team at Priceline the

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,730
travel company we have a great office

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,610
here in Winnipeg where we're hiring

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,429
developers we're also part of a holding

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,619
company so what we've done here we've

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,009
also done at companies like booking.com

19
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,630
kayak opentable Agoda so I've seen this

20
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:16,130
play out in a few different programs and

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:19,280
a few different environments in security

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,530
we've got it great because there's a lot

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,060
of money rolling around when I go to my

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,649
boss and say we need to do something I

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,319
at least get listened to I often get

26
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:31,100
funded and year-over-year I think

27
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,979
everyone's budgets going up but we don't

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,899
have a great way of demonstrating that

29
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:39,229
the money we're spending is going

30
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:42,520
somewhere and that it's producing a

31
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:46,158
measurable improvement in our programs a

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,889
lot of what we do is through adversarial

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,609
testing and much like Mike said

34
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:55,639
yesterday pentesting is broken and the

35
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,408
reason it's broken is a few of them but

36
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:59,899
mostly we keep doing the same thing over

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:03,229
and over again and it's this cycle of

38
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:06,649
self-flagellation that doesn't actually

39
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,530
make improvements that we can measure so

40
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:11,569
I get to represent both the adversarial

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,530
tester testers point of view as well as

42
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,409
the blue team's point of view today

43
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,349
which is fun I've never been a pen

44
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:20,840
tester but I've talked to a few my my

45
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:23,569
impression is the first year you do

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,760
it you love it because every week you go

47
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,069
into a new environment you walk all over

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,149
the network you get da you bypass or EDR

49
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,679
and it's awesome the second year you're

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,750
going back to the same clients and

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,489
you're doing it all again and you start

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,400
to get this feeling when your shell from

53
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,950
a year ago Rica next to you that maybe

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,540
there's a better way of doing this and

55
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,010
maybe by the third year you start

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,810
thinking and getting a little depressed

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,798
and thinking you're not really making an

58
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,360
improvement at your clients part of the

59
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,540
reason is we're not good at measuring

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,989
this right we don't know what good looks

61
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,290
like year over year over year

62
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:04,940
another reason is and as someone on the

63
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,489
blue team on the security team I've done

64
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,160
this you go to your testers and you say

65
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,930
well we would have picked you up

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,690
please note any report how good our

67
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,620
detections are right give us some credit

68
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,349
here my boss is gonna read this and I've

69
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,349
been told pen testers hear that every

70
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,608
week and they get sick of it from our

71
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,819
perspective we didn't love it either

72
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:31,579
right we've gone through years of pen

73
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,980
testing and red teaming and first of all

74
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,500
it pisses me off when we get repeat

75
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,119
findings we read every report and we

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,650
address every finding and sometime in

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,049
the next 12 months something regressed

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:46,430
and showed back up and more importantly

79
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,680
the testing cycle kind of stinks because

80
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,599
you come in you test our environment for

81
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,549
two or three weeks you take a week to

82
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,138
write a report you send it to me I'm

83
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,940
traveling I get back I actually read the

84
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,090
report it's been a month since you

85
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,489
started testing and we've forgotten what

86
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,190
detection is fired when maybe some of

87
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,810
our logs have rolled over and at that

88
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,310
point it's hard for us to make the

89
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,370
improvements and the recommendations

90
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,910
that you're asking for because we need

91
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,500
to repeat the activities you did and

92
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,108
we're smart guys right we know how to do

93
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,418
that but we might not do it the exact

94
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,039
way that the pen testers did it'd be

95
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,500
great if we could repeat their tests

96
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:26,780
exactly without calling the back end for

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,370
a retest or a reengagement in a way that

98
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:34,000
we can do as much as we want right and

99
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:36,280
all-you-can-eat model so there is a us

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,040
government funded nonprofit called mitre

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,200
that's thought a lot about adversarial

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
tactics and created something called the

103
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,590
mitre attack framework and it looks like

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:51,040
a big periodic table right and along the

105
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,719
top are your primary adversarial tactics

106
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,790
well what does the bad guy want to do

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,910
from getting into your environment and

108
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:01,360
moving through and arrayed vertically

109
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,670
are all of the techniques there's 260 of

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,990
them as of a week ago over the next

111
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,220
quarter they're reworking it so that

112
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,080
some of the techniques become sub

113
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,610
techniques but it attempts to be a

114
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,580
comprehensive taxonomy of what attackers

115
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,669
do in your network to compromise it the

116
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,090
tactics you can think of very similar to

117
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,229
the kill chain right they need to

118
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,299
enumerate they need to get persistence

119
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,590
they need to elevate privileges they

120
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,750
need to establish situ they need to

121
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,799
exfiltrate data and then the techniques

122
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,600
the columns right can get very granular

123
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,370
about every technique that an

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,310
adversarial grip has been observed doing

125
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,229
in the wild some of these are simple

126
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,090
some of these are complicated some of

127
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,969
these are used by many groups some are

128
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,770
constrained some apply to many

129
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,300
environments some are restricted to

130
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,700
Windows this grew up as a Windows

131
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,070
framework it now covers Mac and Linux

132
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,140
and mobile but you can see its origins

133
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:00,729
when it gets deep and you know the main

134
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:03,370
controller attacks each ttp alcohol it

135
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,380
each technique is mapped to the groups

136
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,600
that are known to do it there are

137
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,159
examples of the tools they used to do it

138
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,640
so many cats would show up on there and

139
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,650
there are suggested remediations mightor

140
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,650
publishes what they call navigator which

141
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,349
is just a Jas app that you can enable

142
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,630
and disable certain fields based on what

143
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,780
you know about your adversary this takes

144
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:29,620
it from 260 different TTP's to just the

145
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,960
ones you care about so we wanted to use

146
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,610
attack for several reasons from the

147
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,109
adversarial side when I'm over here

148
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,540
right it's something that could be

149
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,100
repeatable and defensible and when I say

150
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,410
oh you should mention our good detection

151
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,780
well maybe we didn't have that good of a

152
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,910
detection right it's really great for

153
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,940
the testers on a reengagement and a

154
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,760
and when the engagements have a better

155
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,410
cadence and once a year to demonstrate

156
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,860
where you're doing well where you rest

157
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,830
and what's changed in your program from

158
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,870
our perspective on the blue team right

159
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,330
it lets us compare ourselves to our

160
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,300
peers across the organization it's a

161
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,750
great way for us to talk to our vendors

162
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,670
and say look your retr we expect you to

163
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,010
detect this very specific thing on this

164
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,660
very specific end point let's all agree

165
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,000
this is what it's called this is it's

166
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,560
TTP number here is a test script that

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,600
someone performed that should generate

168
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,300
it and regenerate it why aren't you um

169
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,630
alerting on this for us it lets us take

170
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,910
that giant list of 260 potential attacks

171
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,740
and narrow it down to the ones we care

172
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,540
about and then make a burned-down list

173
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,890
that we can say okay we've got this one

174
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,030
covered in this environment we've got

175
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,630
this one covered in this environment

176
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:44,479
it's a way to chunk up the work and show

177
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,120
coverage improving on a daily and weekly

178
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,530
basis and not waiting until the next

179
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,800
year when the red team comes back so

180
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:57,020
what we've done is we've done what we

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,090
call purple team exercises this is where

182
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,000
we bring in the third-party adversarial

183
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:05,200
testers into our house sit them in a

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,460
room with my team because we are a

185
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,219
somewhat small security team that means

186
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,469
we're all generalists and to me a

187
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,370
security generalist is going to lean

188
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,560
blue we get the third party adversarial

189
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,170
testers in the room with our security

190
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,750
team we identify what we want to test

191
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,290
and we work through the framework one at

192
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,430
a time

193
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,850
with the red team and the blue team

194
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,950
together owning both the testing and the

195
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,210
alerting I'll show some alerts later and

196
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,098
I don't know whether they were written

197
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,099
by my team or by the adversarial testers

198
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,530
we brought in we've done I think four

199
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,560
rounds of purple teaming now the initial

200
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,959
rounds were mostly about establishing

201
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,209
coverage do we have the right to limit

202
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,640
r-e are we getting the right reporting

203
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,130
from the right devices and as we've

204
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,680
progressed we've been able to get from

205
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,930
this limitary to detecting regressions -

206
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,280
how do we enhance our coverage what

207
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,529
additional tooling what do we need in

208
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:06,290
this environment to collect more

209
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:09,610
intelligence from our end points any Red

210
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,560
Team pen test has constraints on it and

211
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,149
the constraints are sometimes aligned

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,859
with the actual adversaries and

213
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,889
sometimes those constraints are

214
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,600
different and when we go into this

215
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:22,610
process we need to be mindful of the

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,410
constraints that exist we need to

217
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,939
enumerate those and we need to

218
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,769
understand if it's going to help our

219
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:30,680
program or if it's something that's

220
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,720
going to hinder the testing and produce

221
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,388
a negative result so the first

222
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,399
constraint of any you know adversarial

223
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,779
testing you're paying for is time we get

224
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,899
the adversarial testers in for a week

225
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:43,879
two weeks each one of these is a

226
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:47,360
different mitre attack TTP that

227
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:50,629
identifies this specific technique t

228
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,279
1030 is data transfer limits right it

229
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,559
speaks to a low-and-slow data

230
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,059
exfiltration over the course of a week

231
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,149
that's not something we're going to

232
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:02,689
prioritize testing because we just don't

233
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:05,449
have the capability for it the next t

234
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:07,160
1205 anyone you don't have these

235
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:09,500
memorized so that that's port knocking

236
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,259
anyone know what port knocking is it's

237
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,790
something neckbeards did 15 years ago to

238
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:15,860
identify themselves on a network it's

239
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,139
not something that the adversaries we've

240
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,240
identified targeting online travel are

241
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,550
going to do so this is something else we

242
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,709
drop because it's not a threat model and

243
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,240
finally capabilities if it's something

244
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,628
that we know we're not going to allow in

245
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,000
the adversarial testers to do

246
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:34,939
12:07 is a DC shadow or if it's

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,769
something we know we are just not going

248
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:39,050
to pick up and we need to improve

249
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,230
telemetry before them we're flexible and

250
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,269
we drop that and we move on

251
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,100
so Praetorian who has done this

252
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,759
third-party testing where he who shall

253
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,429
not be named works has written a large

254
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,379
number of mitre attack TTP's about 50 of

255
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:57,019
them into test cases that run in

256
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:59,360
Metasploit those are all online on their

257
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,639
github you don't have to use Metasploit

258
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,129
mitre who make the attack framework have

259
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,829
a tool called caldera that has a very

260
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:10,009
similar approach there are commercial

261
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:13,910
tools like red canary or attack IQ that

262
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:15,829
can make the attacks bite-sized

263
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,040
can replay them through your environment

264
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:22,420
and can catch a regression or you know a

265
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,670
new technique that you hadn't considered

266
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,099
why did they choose Metasploit and

267
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:31,550
Daniel and I gave this presentation in

268
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,740
35 minutes and we gave it in 30 minutes

269
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,839
I've not done it in 20 minutes so I've

270
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,230
carved a bunch out here see how I'm

271
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,420
doing

272
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,449
oh yeah we're fine so why did they

273
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,209
choose Metasploit because it's

274
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:46,250
everywhere it's easy to use and it's

275
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:49,040
repeatable most people at least have a

276
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,690
cally box laying around right and it's

277
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,449
got a great development backing some of

278
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,709
the problems with Metasploit first of

279
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:59,959
all it's hard to whitelist the payload

280
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:01,579
our EDR will fire on it even if we put

281
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,670
the hash directly in based on what it's

282
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:07,790
doing and this is my problem not theirs

283
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,370
if if I touch Metasploit once or twice a

284
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,259
year I'm coming in from zero and it's

285
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,579
really hard for me to come back into

286
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:15,589
that if it's not something I'm working

287
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,779
in every day that's why some people will

288
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,689
go for the commercial tooling here

289
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,639
examples of the actual TTP's that Peart

290
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:25,459
Orion have produced and that you can

291
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,470
replay in your environment at Priceline

292
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,939
we're pretty maniacal about how we do

293
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,180
monitoring and alerting we have very

294
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:34,490
strict formatting for our alerting they

295
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,439
are the same about these tests each one

296
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,730
is going to perform reliably it's going

297
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,709
to pop calc it's going to write a file

298
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,540
when you run these you know what's going

299
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,388
to happen and you can tell if it's

300
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,399
successfully completed or not I

301
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:49,880
mentioned that where we maniacal about

302
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,319
detections the most important thing to

303
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,769
come out of the purple team is an

304
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:56,479
improvement to our detection suite and

305
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,759
when we think about this because we're a

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,009
small team and we're an engineering led

307
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,420
team we're not an Operations team we

308
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,459
want detections that we can consume

309
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,110
anywhere that will be instantly

310
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:08,508
understandable as to what's happening

311
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,490
and that we can dismiss as quickly as

312
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:11,959
possible and move on the way we

313
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,899
accomplish this is almost all of our

314
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,160
telemetry throws and flows into our sim

315
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,069
almost all of those alerts will fire out

316
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,930
to slack we can get slack anywhere every

317
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:23,599
alerts got to have a kind of cool and

318
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,969
distinct emoji so that you can instantly

319
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,570
recognize what's going on it's a shared

320
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,310
responsibility we don't have in all

321
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,530
call matrix everyone is suspected to

322
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,869
look at it most of the time on the

323
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,850
weekends that means me when somebody

324
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,890
looks at it you give it a checkmark and

325
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,910
everyone knows to move on if it's

326
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,380
something that requires further

327
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,199
investigation you can start a thread

328
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,439
underneath it in slack every alert like

329
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,020
this will have a link to the underlying

330
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,720
telemetry every alert like this has a

331
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,270
spreadsheet behind it that identifies

332
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,640
all of the mitre attack TTP's associated

333
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,530
with it all known false positives all

334
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,330
known false negatives it'll let you know

335
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,069
the context of the alert when it was

336
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,870
created so that if you're coming into

337
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:08,430
this blind you can kind of understand

338
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:12,210
what's going on anyone used a line like

339
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:16,650
this on their boss before oh my job is

340
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:20,040
so hard if I do my job right you never

341
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,760
hear from me if I mess up just once the

342
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,800
bad guys get in and steal everything

343
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,260
that's kind of not true I've certainly

344
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,839
used it a million times right it gets a

345
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:37,740
lot of sympathy but it's not true right

346
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,630
because we attackers think and change we

347
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,240
think and change right it's it's the

348
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,710
kill chain model and you don't need a

349
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,170
cat on every stair

350
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,270
these are Daniel's cats if you line the

351
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,560
cat's up smartly they'll trip you with

352
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:54,390
only two or three of them so at

353
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,189
Priceline and at the holding company we

354
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,370
think of we call this a tack path

355
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:02,580
mapping right it's a take on the kill

356
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,590
chain and it uses mitre attack it thinks

357
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,510
about our network and what we prioritize

358
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,880
and it shows sort of the complete path

359
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,770
through the network and using that

360
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,330
visualization and lets us understand

361
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:16,189
where we have and where we need to limit

362
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:20,310
reach detection and alerting doing great

363
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:22,770
attack is great but it's not enough it

364
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,500
didn't consider cloud until a week ago

365
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,689
it's not strong on applications right

366
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,270
you need to have something else to think

367
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,850
about that and it's just a framework

368
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:36,960
it's not regulation right it's not being

369
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:40,020
imposed if it helps us and if it lets us

370
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,950
make things better we use it if it

371
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,920
doesn't we

372
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:48,390
something else and move on the

373
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,660
pentesters red teamers purple teamers

374
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:55,890
we've worked with absolutely love to

375
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,360
send us a PDF and then walk away and the

376
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,730
PDFs not useful I think everyone knows

377
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,290
that the the way that we've done it in

378
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,060
these purple team exercises is

379
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,000
Praetorian produces this massive

380
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,770
spreadsheet for us the the span the fans

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,020
on my laptop spin up as soon as I open

382
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,319
it but it's a complete representation of

383
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:16,319
mitre attack and for every cell there's

384
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,760
a technique and through coloration and

385
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,880
other scoring we can understand if we

386
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,439
prioritized it and how our capabilities

387
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,990
are across all of our different

388
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,810
environments it's a much better way of

389
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,120
consuming information about how we

390
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,239
respond to adversarial attacks than a

391
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:40,080
PDF that's 88 pages most of which is

392
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:43,380
copy and pasted out of purple so that's

393
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,000
not Daniels cap so what was my

394
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,689
perspective in going through several

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,460
iterations of purple teaming in my

396
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,830
remaining three minutes the only thing

397
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,110
you need to know communication is the

398
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,150
most important thing communication

399
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,950
before you start talking to the

400
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,480
adversarial testers establishing goals

401
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,610
and scope and everything else

402
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,290
letting the internal teams know what's

403
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,030
happening and where it's happening and

404
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,649
why it's happening and then

405
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,959
communicating with the security team to

406
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,540
understand what are we prioritizing this

407
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:18,959
time we're two days in what isn't

408
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:21,800
working what do we do next the people so

409
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,160
yesterday um was it ray talked about

410
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,540
carbon-based IDS's being you know the

411
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,300
whole company is in the security team

412
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,860
we're a small part of the company and we

413
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,960
need to deputize everyone when we do

414
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,120
this that's why we stress communication

415
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,460
so much and that's why we let people

416
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,649
know what's happening and we let them

417
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,940
know the room will be in and we schedule

418
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,950
office hours and we have them come down

419
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,780
drop in and show them a demo of what's

420
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,670
happening so they understand why we're

421
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,889
doing this right

422
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:54,780
when skipping ahead cuz time is almost

423
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,289
out right

424
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,720
when the test is done we expect a tax on

425
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:03,000
amazed result of here are the techniques

426
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,820
that were attempted here's where we did

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,780
well here's where we need to follow up

428
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,970
here is the test cases we have here are

429
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,500
the test cases we need to build here is

430
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,929
our matrix of alerts we've created

431
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,620
here's what's covered based on mitre

432
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:22,080
attack TTP's and here's what's left

433
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,059
that's the tactical stuff as soon as the

434
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,830
exercise is done we start taking notes

435
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:29,820
about what we want to do differently

436
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:32,370
next time on the strategic side the

437
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,110
outcome of these reports really helps us

438
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:39,389
that's not stressful at all I'm a

439
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,178
strategic side right the outcome of

440
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:46,260
these reports lets us change our

441
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:49,620
approach as an example I had been very

442
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,799
skeptical of the value of pulling in

443
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,449
bash history from production for years

444
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,150
because among all the things we can do

445
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,030
it was more expensive to build and it

446
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,669
was less likely to be used once we had

447
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,220
gone through mitre attack we looked at

448
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,320
the threat actors we cared about we

449
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,130
looked at the TTP's and the suggested

450
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,260
mitigations we I changed our mind right

451
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,799
and we reprioritized what we were

452
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,789
bringing in everything we do falls back

453
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,370
into the spreadsheet

454
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:24,450
everything is taxonomist and prioritized

455
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:26,699
we win in attack runs when an alert runs

456
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,890
we understand the context it's happening

457
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,659
in when someone new joins a team like

458
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,700
happened two or three weeks ago they

459
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:36,480
immediately have a better understanding

460
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,990
of what's happening and why this is

461
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,700
almost the end tips for success again

462
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,460
communication understanding your

463
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,140
priorities upfront knowing what you want

464
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,380
to achieve being flexible to change it

465
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,750
around and most importantly the whole

466
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,549
team can't look like me right if

467
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,620
everyone on the red team and everyone on

468
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,850
the blue team is a 44 year old who's

469
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,830
been in security for 20 years you're

470
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,539
gonna get results alright you need

471
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,309
some variation on the team people who

472
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,590
have done different things and seeing

473
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:06,240
different things to understand what an

474
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,000
adversary is actually going to do on

475
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,159
your network

476
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,990
we're hiring developers in Winnipeg and

477
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,470
across the holding company we need

478
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:18,340
security people in Amsterdam New York

479
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:21,660
Boston San Francisco LA and Bangkok and

480
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:29,869
talk to any of us about that Thanks

481
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:29,869
[Applause]
