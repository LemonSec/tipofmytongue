1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,870
what are you wrong can everyone hear me

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,129
in the back

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,599
good okay first of all thank you all for

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,230
being here on Sunday morning

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:23,140
I know it's hard just like to thank the

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,020
organizers for doing this I know it's

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,009
not easy to organize a conference I do

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,769
that myself back in Brazil so just

9
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:34,630
thanks for them to doing this and this

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,790

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:41,020
last year was talking about their

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,990
checkups the slides and video are online

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,740
if you want to check it out and yeah

14

known as Magna lager and that's it so

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:58,089
yeah I'm gonna up sack or InfoSec

18

specialist I work for a large food

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:05,740
delivery company you might guess which

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,689
one but I'm here representing myself so

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,908

understand if you have any questions

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,700
just let me know that's my main focus

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,940
right now application security testing

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,360
they have SEC ops and secure coding I'm

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,530
the founder of Java SEC which is a

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,170
conference back in Brazil in the

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,280
northeast we're on a fifth edition right

33
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,790
now and we had over 300 people this year

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,010
and I was also the founder of Ross

35
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:52,000
Paribas chapter which is the chapter for

36
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:55,540
my state and that it's running there

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,549
right now with a friend of mine I spoke

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,490
at many conferences back in Brazil also

39
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:03,640
import to go and my second year here

40
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,789
year here in at Longhorn I'm also

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,519
interested in martial arts investments

42
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:13,409
gaming and bug bounty so if you want to

43
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:13,409
talk about those topics just let me know

44
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:20,349
our gender for today is basically web

45
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:22,689
hacking 101 the basics of

46
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,939
web application hacking I know that on

47
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,310
people when I start with working with

48
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:29,499
security they mostly want like the

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,769
offensive part of it like I want a hack

50
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:35,709
stuff I wanna find vulnerabilities right

51
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:38,560
and I know that's interesting and it's

52
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,930
nice but sometimes they just grab some

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,079
tools online and start running them

54
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,439
without understanding what they do and

55
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:49,510
what is happening underlying like what

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,819
is there to making how the two behaves

57
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,099
so I think it's very important for you

58
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:57,488
to understand the basics first before

59
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,018
start doing any hacking yourself so

60
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,349
we're just gonna cover the basics of

61
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,780
HTTP response codes stuff like that very

62
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,530
quickly just to have everyone on the

63
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,260
same page of before we start working

64
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:14,889
with perp and burp suite I'm going to

65
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,138
talk about community edition there's

66
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:21,489
three editions I'm gonna talk about that

67
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:25,569
later and basically a few features from

68
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:28,389
burp proxy target dashboard spider stuff

69
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:34,238
like that basic stuff for you to start

70
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:37,150
doing web application security testing a

71
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,909
few disclaimers not a bug expert right I

72
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,419
just I'm just a user like most people

73
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:47,259
here I understand the - I know how it

74
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:49,090
works but if anything that I say here

75
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,168
you think it's not right or it's not

76
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,169
accurate just let me know

77
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,268
and why not

78
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,759
zap I get I got this question when I was

79
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,489
working at this presentation and a

80
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,259
friend of mine got mad because I said

81
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,269
because I want to talk about burp why

82
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:11,849
not right

83
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:14,859
and basically it's like I have more

84
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:17,918
familiarity with burp I use burp more

85
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:20,949
longer and I think it's it's better than

86
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,948
zap so as much as I like the wasp

87
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:27,479
organization and it's projects I I don't

88
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,479
want to talk about that that's it

89
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:34,780
okay basic introduction about HTTP right

90
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,870
hypertext

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,190
transfer protocol basically what is a

92
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:52,170
hypertext does anyone know here anyway

93
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:54,790
explain to me easily good basically is

94
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:58,510
text with links to our the text right

95
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:01,810
references FiOS stuff like that that's

96
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:06,159
gonna be important later it's a simple

97
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:09,310
lightweight stateless and my default

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,320
without encryption why it's simple

99
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,730
because it's based on requests and

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,890
responses right simple like that

101
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,620
stateless because it doesn't save the

102
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:24,039
state of the user right and we're gonna

103
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:27,990
no we're gonna see how it can how you

104
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,670
can do that with other functionalities

105
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:34,960
basically and without encryption right

106
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:37,020
we know that HTTP it's clear tags you

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,099
can see the communication easily and

108
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,560
that's not safe a little bit of history

109
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,260
the timeline the protocol has less than

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:53,320
30 years start with version oh nine in

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:56,289
1991 the most used version were into

112
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,990
today I think is version 1.1 were slowly

113
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:03,460
shifting to version 2 that was released

114
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:06,190
on 2015 and the version 3 just got

115
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,560
released a few months ago so people are

116
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:15,640
so browsers and companies are slowly

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:19,390
start to use it okay the basic of a get

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:22,000
request here is a get request you have

119
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,640
the method right there on the first line

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,160
you can see it it's a get the path of

121
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,890
the file that you're looking for on the

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,760
application the version of the protocol

123
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,590
and headers down there there are

124
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,260
multiple headers I'm not gonna explain

125
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:42,010
all of them right well you can see it's

126
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:44,310
easily it's easy to know what the header

127
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,310
means

128
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,949
here's a response from the server the

129
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,449
version of the protocol as well the the

130
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,210
status code that we're going to talk

131
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:59,930
about later and the message and also

132
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,560
some headers let me just do a simple

133
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,560
demo here

134
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:30,110
okay so if I want to do a if I want to

135
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,059
do

136
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:46,869
can everyone see this in the back there

137
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:46,869
it's fine what see here

138
00:07:52,270 --> 00:08:06,169
better okay so here if I want to make a

139
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:09,770
simple request sorry bad request here if

140
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:12,339
I want to make I can just change the

141
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,339
version

142
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:28,030
version zero let me see here I have some

143
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:28,030
notes okay the options

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,090
okay so you can have results here you

145
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,039
can do it easily of course manually it's

146
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,500
not feasible for you to test a web

147
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,750
application like that but you can easily

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,300
guess you can have information about the

149
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,360
headers here what it's doing the length

150
00:08:51,300 --> 00:09:12,810
of the fire the the response stuff like

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:15,300
that okay headers allow the client to

152
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,969
and the server to pass the additional

153
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,790
information with the request in the

154
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,740
response the based on the to use the

155
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,439
name and value format they can be

156
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,390
grouped in four types general headers

157
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,960
which are headers that are used on the

158
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,300
request and the response request headers

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,030
mostly used for the only use for the

160
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,910
request response headers for response

161
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,390
and entity headers provides information

162
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:49,500
about the entity or the file that's on

163
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:52,670
the post on the response to main HTTP

164
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,170
methods there are user get and post

165
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,500
basically the difference between those

166
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:02,670
four from our security perspective is

167
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,610
that get sends the parameters on the URL

168
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,719
and you can get their information from

169
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:13,200
logs and from all all the all the paths

170
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,000
that the request goes through and post

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,980
information you have the parameters on

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,870
the body of the request other HTTP

173
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,480
methods that's important to know when

174
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,390
you're testing application had basically

175
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,890
a get problem he turned headers put and

176
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:36,540
delete it's very it's it's used a lot on

177
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:38,939
api's rest api s-- resorption that

178
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,150
provides you a what methods are allowed

179
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,630
on the web server it's also a good start

180
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,130
to know what what is allowed on the web

181
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,990
server what matters that you have there

182
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,209
and trace

183
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,880
the request drew some vulnerabilities

184
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:59,969
really the method usually you should

185
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:03,689
have it disabled on production status

186
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:07,250
code basically you have five categories

187
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:12,060
of status code the main ones are

188
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:15,990
informational from 100 to 199 success

189
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:24,630
200 redirect client or her and several

190
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:27,800
her I ain't never seen in your life

191
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:31,649
scenario are informational he responds

192
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,800
but yeah most common ones are 200 for

193
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:41,420
success 404 not found for free forbidden

194
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:44,040
stuff like that okay so how does the

195
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:48,719
HTTP is stateless how does the

196
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,490
application can control the state of the

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,550
user and manage who is making the

198
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,000
request and maybe save information and

199
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,420
preferences about the user right that's

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,060
using sessions and cookies basically

201
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:06,149
when when you make the first request you

202
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,839
receive a session ID which is stored on

203
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:15,600
your client as a cookie as a text file

204
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:17,430
but those as HTTP is a text protocol you

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,149
can change it can manipulate that stuff

206
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:23,219
if not protected and it's basically a

207
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,529
good example would be a shopping cart

208
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:31,020
where you add information there and it's

209
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:33,270
stored other three topics that it's

210
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,020
important to know when testing

211
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,620
applications

212
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,920
is encoding hashing and an encryption

213
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:44,390
some tips some people might confuse or a

214
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,930
mistake those basically encoding is

215
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:52,949
translating an information to to another

216
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:55,579
another form of of information like it's

217
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:58,800
not an encryption it can be reversed so

218
00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:02,819
it's it's a way for you to make sure

219
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,399
that that information is treated as

220
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:08,069
data and not part of the webpage or not

221
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:13,889
part of the code right for example here

222
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:17,579
a base64 encoding hashing it's very

223
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:20,600
important to understand when you see on

224
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:24,539
the web application when it's being used

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:28,439
hashing basically most applications use

226
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:30,600
hashing for storing passwords right

227
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:36,089
there are multiple algorithms for for

228
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:40,679
hashing most common ones are bcrypt as

229
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:43,699
script pbkdf2 why because older

230
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:47,488
algorithms like md5 and sha-1 they are

231
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:50,069
usually faster right and so if your

232
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:52,829
database gets compromised it's easier

233
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:55,819
for the attack to perform something

234
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:58,410
called hand both tables and try to guess

235
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:01,889
which strings generated that password

236
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,600
and check for that those algorithms they

237
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,929
are slower that's why they are

238
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,899
recommended because it's technically

239
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:13,108
unfeasible for an attacker to guess the

240
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,999
password of your users another thing

241
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:19,499
that's important is also using salt

242
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:21,779
because that prevents two users that

243
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,429
have the same password having the same

244
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,100
hash since you're using the same

245
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,679
algorithm right and for encryption

246
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,229
basically you have symmetric and a

247
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,978
symmetric encryption it can be reversed

248
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:42,989
if you have the key it's mostly used for

249
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:45,149
confidentiality so for example HTTP what

250
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:46,799
is a proxy right because we're gonna we

251
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:49,439
gonna talk about birth to it you need to

252
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,600
understand what is a proxy proxy is

253
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:54,779
basically a message forwarding mechanism

254
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,029
right it's selected by the client it

255
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,829
gets your information and sends to the

256
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:02,369
server the destination that you want and

257
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:04,469
then you receive a response you can if

258
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:06,749
you have control of that proxy you can

259
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,879
either manipulate that data change

260
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:11,069
information add new header stuff like

261
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,939
that and that's what you can do with

262
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:16,529
purpose one verb suit is an intercepting

263
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:18,629
HTTP proxy

264
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,189
it's an integrated platform for

265
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,469
performing security and testing of web

266
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:24,179
applications it's developed by port

267
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,599
triggers the company that maintains the

268
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,089
tool

269
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:29,969
it currently has three editions the

270
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:33,029
Community Edition which is free can

271
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:35,129
download it and use it the Pro Edition

272
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,559
for professionals or consultants who

273
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,869
perform pen test on a daily basis and

274
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,108
their Enterprise Edition which is

275
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:46,199
usually used on a CI CG pipeline for you

276
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:50,869
to run automated scans after you build

277
00:15:46,199 --> 00:16:01,079
your applications its retaining in Java

278
00:15:50,869 --> 00:16:07,949
okay start the demo here just a few

279
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:09,539
notes the community version the

280
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,449
community version doesn't have the

281
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:16,439
vulnerability scanner doesn't have

282
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:21,139
session persistence no engagement tools

283
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:23,909
and also the intruder is throttled like

284
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:25,859
you can't you can't change can use

285
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:28,619
threads and stuff like that you're gonna

286
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,359
see it here so if you work as a

287
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:32,189
professional paint test or if you wanna

288
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:33,599
work is a professional paint tester I

289
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:37,469
recommend you getting the pro version

290
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:39,509
and if you do that on a daily basis and

291
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,519
your company doesn't provide your pro

292
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:48,470
license you need to find another place

293
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,470
to work okay

294
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,090
so after you download install Bert so

295
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,160
here as I said the Community Edition you

296
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,490
can't save where he can open stuff on

297
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,490
the disk basically you can only use a

298
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,870
temporary project which make it hard

299
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,050
because if you're a pen testing mistake

300
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,540
not just one day but more than like a

301
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:22,230
week or two weeks then you're gonna have

302
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,849
to live Bert running for that time and

303
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,589
you can't even shut down your computer

304
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:29,240
otherwise you're gonna lose all your

305
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,240
work so that's a big problem

306
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,680
you can either use the birth default

307
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,510
just fine but you can also load

308
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,730
configuration from a file if you have

309
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,400
specific configurations like if you're a

310
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,230
hardcore user and you you want stuff

311
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,120
done your way and you have some

312
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,400
preference you can save that a file and

313
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,620
load it from there that's fine what are

314
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:55,950
you gonna use the birth defaults okay

315
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,820
the new version that 2.0 or something

316
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,740
now 2.1 they have now this dashboard

317
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:06,649
which is different from the last one

318
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:10,410
version it shows you here exactly the

319
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:14,340
passive crawling or the spider here's

320
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:16,530
just the vulnerabilities here the d show

321
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,590
activity you can hide that if you want

322
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,660
and the event log which shows if you

323
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,949
have any issues with your proxy n or

324
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,320
you're not receiving the information

325
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,510
from your web application you can see

326
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,750
some issues here you can see it right

327
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,960
away that didn't connect to the proxy on

328
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:37,320
port 8080 which is the default port for

329
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,010
burp suite can you wanna anyone guess

330
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,100
what that can be

331
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:46,110
why couldn't connect to the port 8080

332
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,800
some fees lasing already right so what I

333
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:53,879
can do is either turn off that service

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,280
or turn off that service or change the

335
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,010
port easily right so you can see here

336
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,899
there's many tabs this is the photo tabs

337
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,720
here target proxy intruder and stuff

338
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,630
like that we're gonna talk about them

339
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,960
most of them I think if we have time but

340
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,179
here on the tab proxy you can see you

341
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,879
can

342
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,759
to find the options for your proxy where

343
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:17,469
it's gonna listen to so here it's not

344
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,440
running you can see it here because the

345
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,869
checkbox is not marked up there you can

346
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,179
easily add it here so it helps something

347
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:27,789
running on my machine on that word so

348
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:31,389
I'm just gonna change it wait 90 and

349
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:34,990
it's now it's working now it's running

350
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:38,049
and now I can intercept connections here

351
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:41,080
on this browser I have it configured

352
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:44,200
already you can do it yourself you can

353
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,110
go to the proxy options network settings

354
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,019
and change it here manually the problem

355
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,789
is with that is that like for every

356
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:53,679
request for every application that you

357
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,350
go to you're gonna have to either turn

358
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,759
it on and off and again so there's some

359
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:03,549
browser extensions that you can use for

360
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:07,210
for doing that for you automatically for

361
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:09,158
Firefox you have foxy proxy where you

362
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,179
can download and set up work for you

363
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:17,769
here so I have it already enabled see

364
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:20,889
ready localhost 819 stuff like that for

365
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:24,100
if you use Chrome or or any browser

366
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:28,689
derived from chromium you can use the

367
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:30,428
switch geo megha extension as well okay

368
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,509
so now it's listening to bourbon and

369
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:36,340
that's one of the first I think first

370
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:39,549
things that get people when they're

371
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,949
starting to use this tool is that if you

372
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:43,629
make a request and then you see it's

373
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,200
loading and what's happening right

374
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:49,869
what's going on probably usually burp is

375
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,549
gonna show you that there is a it's

376
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:53,220
gonna blink the icon there and you're

377
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,539
gonna see this okay there is a request

378
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,269
stops here and you need to do something

379
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:00,580
because by default the intercept is on

380
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:02,230
so once you start listening to the proxy

381
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,119
incentive inquest you're gonna see

382
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,210
they're gonna capture and wait for your

383
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,740
action you need to do something so if if

384
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,330
you don't care if you're not changing

385
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,110
the request here and you don't care

386
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,649
right now about the requester coming in

387
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:19,149
you just need to first like fingerprint

388
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,629
to the application understand what's

389
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:23,120
doing

390
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:25,340
you can destiny know turn it off here

391
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,290
to all the requests they're going

392
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,709
through bird are gonna show here for you

393
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:34,670
so it's easy you can go back you can

394
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,710
also send it to other tools you can

395
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,050
highlight here with different colors if

396
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,630
you need to go back later as like a note

397
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,190
or something you can also trace it like

398
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,200
the first request that's doing the

399
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:49,850
authentication stuff like that okay so

400
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,610
here is the intercept if you want if you

401
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,659
want to change the request on the fly

402
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,300
you can do it here

403
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,450
the HP history as I mentioned it shows

404
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,990
all the history of the request you can

405
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:05,690
or the order here by like the latest one

406
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,760
is going to show up there you have

407
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:14,230
information about the get methods the

408
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,230
URL they start and stuff like that okay

409
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,320
so I'm gonna just gonna crawl click on

410
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,330
some links here on the application to

411
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,330
have feed information to work

412
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,540
right

413
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,390
you can see the request here you can see

414
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,750
also the parameters that I felt that I

415
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,660
provided to work you can see that there

416
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,490
is a user token as well so all that

417
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,180
stuff you can see here and on proxy and

418
00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:04,290
you can send it to other features of

419
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:06,450
work oh I forgot to mention there is

420
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,570
like a workflow of birth through some

421
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,820
tool specifically for rakonin analysis

422
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,330
others for vulnerability detection and

423
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,450
others specifically for to configuration

424
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,919
I advise you not to test on on live

425
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,040
applications that you don't have

426
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,500
authorization to do it so here for you

427
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,680
there's some OS project that provides

428
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,110
you with a lot of vulnerable

429
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,240
applications for you to test those ones

430
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,479
are online so you can just browse the

431
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,700
website and in and configure there

432
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,170
there's some ones there are like live VM

433
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,800
that you can download and install on

434
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,240
your machine yeah if you don't have if

435
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,330
you don't have permission to do it and

436
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,100
it's not your own website and make sure

437
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,490
that you have written permission when

438
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,490
you do it

439
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,330
so birth configuration we've done the

440
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,970
word proxy

441
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:03,360
I've okay I forgot the certificate

442
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:07,080
that's something if you're accessing a

443
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,449
website that uses HTTPS you're probably

444
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,280
gonna have an issue and that's the

445
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,710
second thing that usually get most

446
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,530
people and starting with perb because

447
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:19,620
you need to add the birth certificate on

448
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:25,639
your browser so that verb can creates

449
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,639
the tunnel between that application so

450
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:36,210
okay now here it's working but if you

451
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:38,850
check the certificate here you can see

452
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,870
that what generated by poor trigger

453
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:44,550
certificate authority so what you can do

454
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,209
you can either go directly to work or

455
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,210
you can

456
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,470
you can go here and get the certificate

457
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,020
saved on your machine that certificate

458
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,210
from port Swiger and you can go to your

459
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:10,860
browser options and import that

460
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:12,870
certificate there few certificates on

461
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,159
authorities you can import and then you

462
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,139
just add the file that you just

463
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,240
downloaded from birth there and it's

464
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,580
going to now it's going to create the

465
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,380
proper channels between your HTTP

466
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,290
applications and work and then you can

467
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,720
easily test it so basically it's going

468
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:31,370
to do SSL inspection to see the

469
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,370
information and show you the requester

470
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,580
okay also the verb has a lot of

471
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,500
documentation available for you you can

472
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,699
open in here if you have any questions

473
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,590
it's all the information that's

474
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,050
available on their website but if you

475
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,250
don't have a connection an internet

476
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,290
connection when you're testing an

477
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,810
application if you're using a local

478
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,450
proxy for from an enterprise or

479
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,919
something you can easily see the

480
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:06,990
information here all the documentation

481
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:09,720
available the dashboard is going to show

482
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:12,240
you how many links I think said it added

483
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,450
to the map you can see it here that

484
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,420
there's a lot of URLs on the target site

485
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,960
map I don't want to test all those

486
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,790
applications so I can tell burb to

487
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,920
remove them from scope and ads this is

488
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:31,500
specifically website to the scope so if

489
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:35,250
I go here and just click in here add to

490
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,800
scope see this is gonna give me a

491
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:41,150
warning like everything that sort of

492
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,149
scope is not gonna show on the history

493
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,900
so it sorry it's gonna start ignoring

494
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,030
those all those sites especially when

495
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,220
you're testing a live or production web

496
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,230
application that have links to other

497
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,090
websites that you don't own or that's

498
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,540
outside of scope is very important to

499
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,159
note that before start testing because

500
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,570
otherwise you might be scanning

501
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,860
applications that you don't have

502
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,020
permissions to do it

503
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,520
so just take notes into that so you can

504
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,870
see it here that's gonna show logging

505
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,510
out of scope is disabled right we added

506
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,928
here I can do it manually here if I want

507
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:19,530
I can exclude for example specific

508
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:22,380
directories or specific paths of the

509
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,840
application if I want here on the

510
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:28,799
sitemap it's gonna basically basically

511
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,459
show to me all the all the pages and

512
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,799
files that bird was able to crawl the

513
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,020
great the the black ones is the one that

514
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,600
it specifically made a request to and

515
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,129
the gray ones is that found a link there

516
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,399
on that page but it didn't make the

517
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:50,820
proper request yet so but it shows for

518
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:56,549
you that it sits there it exists some

519
00:27:50,820 --> 00:28:00,480
scope sitemap that basically it so you

520
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:03,500
can you can either you can you can send

521
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,450
this request to other tools from work

522
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:11,490
one of the tools that's very interesting

523
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:13,710
is the intruder the intruder is

524
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,049
basically semi-automated

525
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,559
module from web that you can use to

526
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:22,790
execute payloads you can either you can

527
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:26,220
do like brute force in attacks you can

528
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,928
map the number of users of application

529
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:34,820
can do most of things

530
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:37,830
it's very configurable when you send a

531
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,710
specific request to intruder it's

532
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:44,899
already gonna flag a few parameters that

533
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:47,730
you might wanna use it for your attack

534
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:52,200
you can change that you can clear you

535
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:54,270
can add new ones there are four type

536
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,130
attack types that's one of the things

537
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,200
that people usually don't understand or

538
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:02,490
forget when using web there are four

539
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:06,000
attack types on the thing tutor the

540
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:11,700
first of them is the sniper where it's

541
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,770
gonna change every request with only one

542
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,720
of if you have multiple parameters it's

543
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:18,418
gonna change every request

544
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,549
with the first payload that is sent for

545
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:23,700
that first parameter and then it's going

546
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:25,408
to send and then it go it goes on for

547
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,860
the next parameters that you have but

548
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:31,650
using one single list the battering ram

549
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,809
is you have if you have multiple

550
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,000
parameters set up here it's going to

551
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:38,309
change all the parameters at once for

552
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,470
the first payload and send it to to the

553
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:45,270
application the pitchfork allows you to

554
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,039
have different leads lists for each

555
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,690
parameter that you have but it's going

556
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,090
to change them every time at every

557
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:54,510
request and cluster bomb which is the

558
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:57,809
most exhaustive one it's gonna perform

559
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,580
others permutations of lists that you

560
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,559
have and it's going to send a lot of

561
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,500
requests for the application so make

562
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,330
sure you use it wisely and you know what

563
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,669
you're trying to accomplish with the

564
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,520
attack so that you use the proper attack

565
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:13,669
type because I've seen otherwise if you

566
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,260
don't especially if you're doing like

567
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:18,120
external pain test and you don't want to

568
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,610
get detected you need to make sure that

569
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,320
you make the least amount of requests to

570
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,090
to find the information of the

571
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,070
application otherwise you're gonna get

572
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:31,830
flagged by the security team of the

573
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:33,689
company here you can add your payloads

574
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,049
as I said you can have much multiple

575
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:41,450
payloads here sets here if I add for

576
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:43,620
example I can add as a parameter here

577
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,659
because I'm using the sniper so I'm

578
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,520
gonna show one list if I am using the

579
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:51,030
pitchfork it's going to show other lists

580
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,158
here and it's gonna show me the pay load

581
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,840
count and the requests count based on

582
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,789
the list that I provide you burp so you

583
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,139
know how many requests it's going to

584
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:00,140
make before it makes

585
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:21,700
just numbers let me move this if I have

586
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:24,340
like it's not a good idea but if you

587
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,299
have application that has session IDs

588
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,639
that are not random unique and you can

589
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:33,070
guess that information you can just try

590
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,630
to find a session ID that's valid here

591
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:40,809
for example I can tell it to go random

592
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:43,630
numbers I can also set step by step how

593
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:46,720
many requests in increment by five for

594
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:52,000
example by one it shows your up there

595
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,380
how many requests it's going to make if

596
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:04,000
you want to start the attack you can

597
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:07,450
start the attack here yeah it's gonna

598
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,789
give you this just this warning here

599
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,620
some attacks are totally as I mentioned

600
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:16,179
so it might take more time right and you

601
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:20,070
can easily see all the requests that

602
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:26,409
it's making as just an example here

603
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:29,049
how can you see if the the intruder

604
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:36,850
attack that you made was successful

605
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:38,320
how can you guess sorry yes exactly so

606
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,049
the payload size would be the first

607
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,950
guess for you to think you can order by

608
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:46,629
the length here so you can identify

609
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:49,330
what's different because if you're

610
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,760
getting the same error or the same bad

611
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,799
response every time when the attack six

612
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,019
is successful then you can see it's

613
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,879
probably gonna have a different size and

614
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:01,090
also the response code if the

615
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,710
application is not returning 200 all the

616
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:06,129
time because I've seen applications do

617
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,230
that just treat the eye scanner then you

618
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,139
can easily guess by the status of the

619
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:13,809
response which information was

620
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:17,020
successful when you don't have that or

621
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:20,020
you couldn't guess what was wrong what

622
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,430
was different you can send the request

623
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,350
to compare

624
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:28,000
which is another feature from work and

625
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:31,620
compare those those two requests so as I

626
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,330
said the options here on the intruder is

627
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,149
it's disabled on the community version

628
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,100
but you can if you have the pro version

629
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,900
you can change stuff here on triads and

630
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,540
stuff like that to make the attack

631
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:49,930
either go faster or go slower if you

632
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:52,810
want to go undetected basically that's

633
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:57,060
it from the intruder the repeater is

634
00:33:52,810 --> 00:34:00,370
another feature where I can easily

635
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:05,290
change requests on the fly and send it

636
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:10,679
back and see the response here so I can

637
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:10,679
modify and already see the response if

638
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,810
if I want to go back to the previous one

639
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,540
I can use that history doesn't show on

640
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,460
the HP history but it shows here I seen

641
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,969
the response right away if I'm trying to

642
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,770
find something specific payload on on

643
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:31,270
the application and what's going on

644
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:32,770
right so it's good for that you can

645
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,350
change the windows here if you don't

646
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:43,210
wanna show the requests and response on

647
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:45,940
the poll on the same window okay the

648
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,880
decoder as I talked about the encoding

649
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,830
and decoding options you can get strings

650
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,660
from your application and you can encode

651
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,210
or decode here there are many options

652
00:34:52,659 --> 00:35:00,640
for you to encode or decode it's here

653
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:03,270
URL encoding HTML encoding basics for

654
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,270
stuff like that

655
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:11,430
they compare if I want to send two

656
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,430
different requests to the compare

657
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,900
I select the first one the first one

658
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,940
request that I sent here and the second

659
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:29,590
one here and I can compare by words and

660
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,880
by bytes usually I use by words you can

661
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,820
see the difference it's going to show

662
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,740
again I got to hand on request here and

663
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,790
it's going to show it's basically a div

664
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:42,790
too so you can see what change methods

665
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:44,920
what was added and what was deleted so

666
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,600
you can easily see especially if you're

667
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,120
running the intruder attack and you

668
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:55,839
don't know what change you can check in

669
00:35:49,120 --> 00:36:00,160
here burp has also a lot of extensions

670
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,510
it's a very a module 2 you can add you

671
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,819
can add these tensions there you can

672
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:08,500
create your own it has also an API for

673
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,930
for the community version you still have

674
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,750
a lot of extensions that are free so you

675
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,240
don't need to have the pro version those

676
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:20,740
those ones here you require the pro

677
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:23,259
version you can list here which ones are

678
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:28,330
more popular or have better ratings to

679
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:32,680
try it out to two plugins that I really

680
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:35,259
like using is the auto repeater and the

681
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,060
toolbar intruder so we automate some

682
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,280
stuff that you're doing manually here

683
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:44,759
with intruder and repeater automates for

684
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:47,530
you on the fly while you're testing and

685
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,420
if you if you're testing and a web

686
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:52,120
application from a network that all the

687
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,600
traffic needs to go to a proxy you can

688
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:04,960
set up the proxy here there are multiple

689
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:09,580
options for proxy for your testing just

690
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:14,110
go back talked about documentation the

691
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:15,580
burp store ok dashboard spidering we

692
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:19,240
mention about spying what it is

693
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,799
basically you get the first page you get

694
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,930
all the reference all the links there

695
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,560
and you go through that and it goes on

696
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:29,680
on the application checks for JavaScript

697
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,210
files stuff like that sitemap scope

698
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,450
target positions

699
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:39,280
payloads options the repeater I

700
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:43,359
mentioned as well compare decoder for if

701
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,829
you want to decode anything there and I

702
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,020
recommend you take a look at those two

703
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:50,050
extensions it's really nice and also

704
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,660
