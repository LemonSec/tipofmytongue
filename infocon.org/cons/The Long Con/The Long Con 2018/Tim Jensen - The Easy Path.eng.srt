1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,330
howdy everybody can you hear me okay

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,860
perfect alright so this is going to be

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,279
the shortest talk of a given since high

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,740
school

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,900
so I'm kind of excited so could we talk

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,250
about the easy path of pen testing more

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,830
or less this is the things that if you

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,180
know you can fake being a pen tester at

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,740
least you know enough to get the job and

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,559
you know build your skills from there I

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,000
hope so so I'm Tim Jensen I work for

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,209
apps tech consulting out of San Jose

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,620
California a lifetime hacker blah blah

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,570
blah this is a short talk so I'm not

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,849
gonna go over everything but it's there

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,989
so if you want to look at it later

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,339
so what we're gonna be talking about is

18
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,129
some vulnerabilities some tools some

19
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:53,070
tactics that have repeatable success

20
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,989
specifically with mostly with protocols

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,400
that are never going to get fixed so you

22
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,260
can keep using these skills for life

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,879
which is always great and then I'm gonna

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,320
be you know telling you how to defend

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,729
against them as well so if you have a

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,510
network and don't want to get breached

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:09,120
by these hopefully I can help ya so

28
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,920
setting some expectations which I worked

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,860
at Microsoft at one point that's exactly

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,380
the words that we had to use so what is

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,270
a security vulnerability right so

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,408
security vulnerability is a weakness in

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,060
a product that could allow an attacker

34
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,280
to compromise the integrity availability

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,020
or confidentiality of a product

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,969
everybody kind of assumes that right

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,548
well why have Microsoft doesn't fix a

38
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,839
lot of things is because they do not

39
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,640
consider it a vulnerability if the

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,100
protocol was designed and securely to

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,799
begin with so I have had this strong

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,829
discussions with people on this and I

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,689
have lost but if you're ever wondering

44
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,279
why they're not going to fix these this

45
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,669
is why because they will point you to

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,310
the website and say you're an idiot

47
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,840
so last year a bunch of people including

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,310
myself talked about responder you're

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,310
probably sick of it but why I keep

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,649
bringing it up responder is still not

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,200
fixed on most people's networks I've had

52
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,539
two people this year and all the pen

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,539
tests I've done that have been you know

54
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:13,020
not vulnerable to responder so it's kind

55
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,859
of bad so responder is a tool that works

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,120
on the SMB protocol and responds back to

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,350
actually not just the SMB protocol but

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,370
it responds back to a lot of different

59
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,350
protocols that are vulnerable and

60
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,570
basically somebody will say hey

61
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,840
are you this and it says sure I am send

62
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,850
me creds and we can talk that's it so

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,800
it's a great tool it's easy to use and

64
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,130
it works on several different protocols

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,900
so SMB NetBIOS w pad which if you've

66
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,510
never heard of w pad i'm sorry cuz it's

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,690
turned on and all your machines LM n R

68
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,190
and mssql are things that responder

69
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,910
really does well it does a lot of other

70
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,160
things as well

71
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:56,430
but these are the ones that most common

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,170
so when you run responder anybody that's

73
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,730
doing pretty much anything on the

74
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,290
network like if you're going to a file

75
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,730
share or even opening a website a lot of

76
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,850
times your computer is connecting over

77
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,739
SMB for random reasons and responder

78
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,380
just says hey send me your creds and you

79
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,170
do so there is a username and a password

80
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,200
hash that I have blotted out because

81
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,609
that's my password hash so you know

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,380
pretty easy but we get a lot of

83
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,760
customers that are like yeah but it's a

84
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,460
password hash and I've got a twenty

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,170
eight character password right so that's

86
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,380
a problem I can't crack that 28

87
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,820
character password well unfortunately

88
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,250
that doesn't matter and I'll get into

89
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,920
that in a second but so basic

90
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,570
mitigations for responder SMB two-factor

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,230
authentication doesn't work because SMB

92
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,790
doesn't support two-factor

93
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,700
authentication so even if you have it

94
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,799
turned on on Windows SMB is bypassed and

95
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,619
you can get a meterpreter shell very

96
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,000
easily strong passwords don't matter and

97
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,450
I'll talk about that again in a second

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,580
and password rotations with software

99
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,579
like cyber-ark if you know what that is

100
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,870
cyber-ark will change your passwords for

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,000
you and you don't even have to know it

102
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,710
it's a password manager so you use an

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,030
admin password I'm a server five minutes

104
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,030
later it's going to rotate that password

105
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,420
and because it's not instantaneous

106
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,890
rotation these tools are so fast that it

107
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,060
doesn't matter once we get a hash we can

108
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,380
pass it so medications that do work and

109
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,000
you have to do all of them so if you're

110
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,920
trying to fix responder there's your

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,060
list so you don't have to pay somebody a

112
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,860
lot of money

113
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,710
disabled NetBIOS disabled lmn are and

114
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,510
set SMB signing to required that's one

115
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,849
that catches people so there's enabled

116
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,949
disabled and required

117
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:44,699
if you said it to enabled or sorry

118
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,149
always actually no one ever might it was

119
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,069
wrong

120
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:49,949
enabled so if you send it to enable that

121
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,629
sounds like you're protected but it's

122
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:53,099
actually just the optional of if

123
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,159
everybody supports it that I'm gonna use

124
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:58,740
it so if you said it required we we can

125
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:02,009
say if if it's set to enabled we can say

126
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,539
hey I don't support it and then it's

127
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,039
vulnerable again so as long as the

128
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:12,240
attackers in the middle which responder

129
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:15,330
does you have to send it required so why

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,279
long passwords don't matter why password

131
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,050
rotation doesn't matter is a great tool

132
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,580
called multi relay that's with responder

133
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,979
so multi relay you set it up and

134
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,419
basically when responder responds to a

135
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,159
host gets the password hash you've

136
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,099
already told it I want to connect to

137
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:33,449
this server let's say a file share and

138
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,878
all that it does is it passes the hash

139
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,800
over to the file server so you never

140
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,959
have to crack the hash and responder

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,029
gives you this nice little once it's

142
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,789
compromised so waits for an admin user

143
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:46,529
cuz you know every other user is garbage

144
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,329
so waits for the admins to come along

145
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,369
and gives you this nice little shell and

146
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,110
one thing you can do is like me me cats

147
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,610
so once you've got an admin on the file

148
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,009
server it's probably an enterprise

149
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,779
domain admin let's face it so at that

150
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:59,279
point you can just dump their cred plain

151
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,779
text and log into the domain controller

152
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,149
add your own domain admin and you've

153
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,649
taken over the whole network so start to

154
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,969
finish with responder and multi relay

155
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:09,379
we're talking less than five minutes to

156
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:12,329
VBA on the network so it's kind of great

157
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:15,269
and then there's other things you can do

158
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:19,229
with this so you can do any command on

159
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:21,329
the server as system obviously you can

160
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,679
create your own local admins for you

161
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:24,689
know backups in case you know something

162
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:28,378
happens that way you've got local access

163
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:31,409
that box you can pivot so a lot of times

164
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,719
I'm doing PCI pentest so there's the pay

165
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:36,058
card network for credit cards and then

166
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:38,009
the regular network that's toxic and if

167
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:39,719
you find a host that has an IP on both

168
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,059
you can use this to break into that host

169
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:44,339
do one command to pivot over all of your

170
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:46,829
traffic and now you're attacking inside

171
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:49,039
this nice secure zone so we find that a

172
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:49,039
lot

173
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,429
and yes I am trying to rush this talk

174
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,279
I'm sorry if you have questions talk to

175
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:56,179
me later so one big thing that I also

176
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,589
hear from customers all the time

177
00:06:56,179 --> 00:07:01,369
antivirus will save us

178
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:02,869
so Symantec is the number one yeah I

179
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:06,259
hear what

180
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:08,209
so Symantec is the number one antivirus

181
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,279
for corporations

182
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,869
so most deployments you can run that

183
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,129
command right there and it shuts off the

184
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:16,009
antivirus you just have to run it on

185
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,779
command line so they'll protect the GUI

186
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,909
so if you right-click and try to disable

187
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,189
antivirus it doesn't work but nobody's

188
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:25,998
setting this the command line

189
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:28,009
stop arguments so it's very easy again

190
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:30,559
with with multi relay there it gave you

191
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:34,219
a command line console you can just do

192
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,529
CD go to this SMC Exe space - stop and

193
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,879
the AV shuts down and now if that was

194
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:40,159
blocking your me me cats or whatever

195
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,740
from running to grab passwords out guess

196
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,748
what now you can go back out of that run

197
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,429
me me cats and dump all the passwords so

198
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:48,739
it's very convenient

199
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:50,659
so again if you're running Symantec make

200
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:52,909
sure those settings are set I have seen

201
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:55,039
absolutely zero people having set those

202
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:58,759
including well I'm not going to talk

203
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,550
about that so antivirus failure number

204
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,679
two so I talked about creating a local

205
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,589
admin account to get on a server so

206
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:07,998
let's say that they have you know really

207
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,289
really good security I've seen some

208
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:11,809
people are running like three anti

209
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,089
viruses file integrity monitoring all

210
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:16,490
this kind of stuff right really hardened

211
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:17,899
I can't get anything to work well if

212
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,729
I've created that local admin account

213
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,369
what I can do is Remote Desktop to the

214
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:24,558
server as that local admin right well

215
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:27,459
when you've got the Box up you can

216
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:30,409
attach your c drive from your attacker

217
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:32,899
you know workstation so I've got a

218
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,218
little Windows attacker VM so I can

219
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,958
attach my own C Drive with all of my

220
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:40,029
hacker tools on it when I already P in

221
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:43,758
no antivirus can scan an RDP attached

222
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,589
share it just can't happen and I have a

223
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,360
great story that I probably don't have

224
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,009
time to tell about how I found that out

225
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,959
and it is embarrassing so feel free to

226
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:55,430
ask me later but yeah so I found that

227
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,579
out this is a hundred percent successful

228
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,649
it will bypass everything so just load

229
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,540
up me me cats load up whatever tools you

230
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,940
want any exploit code

231
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,610
meterpreter payloads and exe whenever

232
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,960
and you know run it on their

233
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:15,620
double-click and it's gonna work

234
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:19,070
so AV bypassed so the part that I'm not

235
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,510
repeating from last year so newer tools

236
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,330
that I've been finding that our older

237
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:27,530
tools that not many people are using

238
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,700
crack map Express exec or crack map for

239
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,400
short because I always get the exact

240
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,290
part wrong is a great tool so it's got

241
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,060
several different components and

242
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,089
basically what it's doing is it's tying

243
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,060
together

244
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:44,140
Metasploit with responder that's really

245
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,250
kind of what it does well but basically

246
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,530
here's just some of the features that it

247
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,550
does so one thing I can run any code on

248
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,850
it as long as I have a user name

249
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,339
password and it execs Acutes it over SMB

250
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,050
it runs it all in memory so you're not

251
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,990
gonna get caught by AV most of the time

252
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,760
there is a few times it does but most of

253
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,590
the time you can run whatever so I put

254
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,840
like the ARP - a there which is really

255
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,490
nice so if you've got if you get like a

256
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,690
domain admin cred and you're on a short

257
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,730
engagement like I've had a few times

258
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,910
this year and I'm trying to break into

259
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,290
the card data environment for PCI if I'm

260
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,930
looking for a dual homed host and as

261
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,310
most of those IP is I can run ARP a

262
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,859
across every single host in their

263
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:26,060
network and then I'm just grepping out

264
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,190
real quick hey can I see any 172 dot 16

265
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,569
addresses right if it's that that it's

266
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,920
in this protected environment if I can

267
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,810
find that then I found that host I

268
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,370
should be targeting and attacking so

269
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,250
really select adjust run something

270
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,870
across everything or if you want to make

271
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,160
that backup account for everybody I mean

272
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,050
you can throw that in there too and you

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,230
know net use add and you know add or

274
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,640
delete users gathering creds across the

275
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,430
network is where I really love it so you

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,770
can run me me cat's across every box

277
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:54,229
very quickly so what I start with

278
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,550
usually is a lower privileged user so

279
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,730
you all that you need is one user

280
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,240
account and you can run it across all of

281
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,710
us slash 24 or slash 16 or whatever it's

282
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,140
ridiculously fast like 30 seconds to run

283
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,550
through slash 24 and it runs through and

284
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,230
it dumps all the credits on the boxes

285
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,579
then you go through all those creds you

286
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,470
take one of those creds you pop it in

287
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,520
your run it again you take those creds

288
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,290
you keep doing this until you get a

289
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,329
domain admin account once you have

290
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,738
domain admin account then

291
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:19,089
just logged into every single box and

292
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:20,920
dumped creds and now you know that hey

293
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,959
I've got a demain admin I go log into

294
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,549
the domain controller right and create

295
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,069
my own days domain admin and have taken

296
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:29,769
over the network so again very fast and

297
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:32,860
convenient and then the incredibly

298
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,449
dangerous a really fun thing to do that

299
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,879
I have not done on a customer network

300
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:39,790
for obvious reasons you can point that

301
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:43,329
like a slash 24 and get a meterpreter

302
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,149
shell on every single host so and again

303
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:48,118
it's pretty much instantaneous 256

304
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:50,049
shells coming back is pretty great

305
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:51,910
someday I want to be able to do that on

306
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:54,009
a slash 16 and just watch my box get

307
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,709
completely destroyed from from reverse

308
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:59,410
shells coming back but it's really great

309
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:01,929
and it's really fast and easy and the

310
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,929
usages are just great so it's a tool

311
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:07,149
that I highly recommend but it scares

312
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:08,649
the hell out of people when you got

313
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,389
domain admin and now you've taken over

314
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,860
like everything very quickly because now

315
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,980
you can run commands on every single

316
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:20,619
host simultaneously it's kind of

317
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:22,540
shocking to customers I'm talking faster

318
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:24,639
than I thought I'm good alright so

319
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,480
another thing that responder does it's a

320
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,119
little newer so July 2017 is ms SQL

321
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,989
servers so here we get into another

322
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:38,019
protocol the Microsoft really screwed up

323
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:39,579
so when you go to a or when your

324
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,160
computer I should say is trying to find

325
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:45,459
an instance of ms SQL it does slash

326
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,049
slash my DB right and sometimes you can

327
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,969
give it an IP sometimes you don't but

328
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,980
regardless when you do that it's sending

329
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,009
out a broadcast message to your entire

330
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,209
network saying who has my DB well just

331
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,949
like everything else in respond or

332
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,669
responder replies back and says I have

333
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:03,040
it send me a password and you do so if

334
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:05,259
any of your software is using ms SQL

335
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,660
whenever your clients are connecting to

336
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:09,309
it they're all able to broadcast their

337
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,679
passwords some of our plaintext some of

338
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,360
them are hashes but regardless it's

339
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,850
pulling everything and usually almost

340
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,220
every time I'm getting a sa or

341
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,629
administrator password back which again

342
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,369
if it's the administrator password half

343
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:23,610
the time as a domain admin for some odd

344
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:26,799
reason I haven't figured it out yet but

345
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,920
like the only remediation to this is

346
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,660
stop using ms SQL like I

347
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,099
nothing like this is such a

348
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:40,180
vulnerability it's just handing your

349
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:43,480
data away on your internal network so so

350
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,109
hopefully not a surprise Ms 1701 zero

351
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,760
came out last year so an SMB

352
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,860
vulnerability Microsoft put out a patch

353
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,959
right away this was a leaked and I

354
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,930
always get this wrong CIA or NSA one or

355
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,510
the other accidentally it got it leaked

356
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:01,660
but basically you send a packet at this

357
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,220
computer you get a shell right doesn't

358
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,139
really matter about antivirus doesn't

359
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,699
matter about anything it just pops in

360
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,180
magically works and dumps you in the

361
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,459
system

362
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:14,560
very rarely crash is human which is nice

363
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:18,399
so the problem with that is it's only on

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,839
64-bit clients the meterpreter shell or

365
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,940
the Metasploit version the official CIA

366
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,610
NSA whatever it was tool works on all of

367
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,959
them but you know do you really want to

368
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,850
connect to that and hope that they're

369
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,500
not sending all the data back to the NSA

370
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,160
or something I don't know about you guys

371
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:39,399
but my customers would kind of kill me

372
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,850
so when I just found out somewhat

373
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,209
recently was there is another ms70 and

374
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,199
zero one zero in Metasploit and i kind

375
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:49,989
of ignored it because the other one

376
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:54,010
worked right but i found out is this

377
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,620
other one is using PS exec and it works

378
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,680
on x86 clients and most importantly what

379
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,720
I found out is it works on Windows 2000

380
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,279
so if you have any Windows 2000 boxes on

381
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,800
your network and I've gotten this so

382
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,240
much it's not even funny you get told

383
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,709
well we know that there's a lot of

384
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,149
exploits out there for it or

385
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,949
vulnerabilities for it but there are no

386
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,019
exploits so you can actually attack with

387
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:16,109
so we're not gonna fix the Windows 2000

388
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,399
box until you can actually break into it

389
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,300
easily well this makes it

390
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,769
point-and-click I can teach a

391
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,120
five-year-old to do this in five minutes

392
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,690
right there should be YouTube video

393
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,519
they're probably already is but very

394
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,620
easily you can break into a Windows 2000

395
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,149
box there's no patch for this so if

396
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,130
you're running any Windows 2000 that's

397
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:37,510
bad but if you're running into any MS

398
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,819
1701 zeros out there that are x86 this

399
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,040
is the way to get into them and and

400
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:43,779
break-in so it's kind of nice I will say

401
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,879
a note that I have here

402
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:49,420
so normally the share that it uses

403
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,240
automatically is dollar sign admin for

404
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,709
Windows 2000 you have to change that to

405
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,300
or sorry admin dollar sign you have to

406
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:57,189
change it to see dollar sign because

407
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,199
Windows 2000 didn't have an admin share

408
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:01,509
so you change it to that and it works

409
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,180
and sometimes you need to give this one

410
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:09,040
creds most of the time you don't so it's

411
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,839
kind of slick and the creds don't have

412
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,559
to be admin just any literally any

413
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,300
domain cred will get you into their box

414
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,999
so just to be complete on that I also

415
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,769
wanted to point out MS 0 0 6 7 if this

416
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:24,999
one's a shock to anybody you're probably

417
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:26,829
really young so this was back from 2008

418
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:28,990
it's the exact same thing as Emmons MS

419
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:33,339
17 0 & 0 the only reason I'm bringing it

420
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:36,430
up is that necessarily and I'm still

421
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:39,220
finding at least 50 of them a year so if

422
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:45,339
you're ever seeing hosts that are old

423
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,899
like 2000 2003 XP 2008 I just recommend

424
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,149
manually trying to exploit them

425
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,559
I will say that nessus 8 just caught one

426
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,230
for the first time version 8 just came

427
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,389
out I think last week version 8 caught

428
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,250
the first one in like 2 years for me so

429
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,449
I'm kind of happy about that so they

430
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,779
might have fixed it or it might have

431
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,079
just been a fluke but you'll see but

432
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,270
yeah

433
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,789
so if you ever want to run into that I

434
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,770
gave some steps on basically how to

435
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:15,099
parse out all your all those hosts and

436
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:19,990
and run it to exploit them so cisco

437
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:22,990
smart install this is a fun one so cisco

438
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,849
smart install really broke in like March

439
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,209
of this year but the history of it is

440
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:30,580
really funny so last year around them

441
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,049
this time or a little earlier rapid 7

442
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,760
and a couple other companies started

443
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,929
talking about Cisco smart install and

444
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,450
they were really late to the game

445
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,919
because some random russian guy that

446
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,289
doesn't exist if you look up the history

447
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,210
talked at a con and released this tool

448
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:45,970
like to actually almost three years ago

449
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,340
now so it's been out there for a long

450
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,080
time which should be scary so if you're

451
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,689
a network admin you should really be

452
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,220
looking at part 4 7 8 6 and if you're

453
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,409
seeing that on your network shut it off

454
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,750
so basically what you can do with this

455
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:01,990
it's called see it is the

456
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,940
so basically Cisco smart install

457
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,800
protocol is supposed to make it really

458
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,420
easy for Cisco devices to talk and

459
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,730
configure themselves without admins

460
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,620
needing to but what you can do with this

461
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,480
protocol is just do a dash G in this

462
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,719
guy's tool and it downloads the Cisco

463
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,870
config to your device and he uses TFTP

464
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,500
to do it and it's turned on by default

465
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:27,370
on every Cisco device since 20 or sorry

466
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:29,590
2006 so do it - G it pulls down the

467
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,629
config you can change whatever you want

468
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,459
in it and re-upload it it'll reboot

469
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,220
their device so that'll get you caught

470
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,420
but yeah you can re-upload it and now

471
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,700
you've taken over their network

472
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,980
equipment internally we see it a lot

473
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,090
externally we're seeing it more than we

474
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,650
should the upside is externally normally

475
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,790
people are blocking it so you can't pull

476
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:52,420
the config because then they have to

477
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,620
have TFTP open outbound which thankfully

478
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,620
a lot of people are blocking

479
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:00,129
surprisingly but it's happening more

480
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,689
often than not there is an execute

481
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,520
function as well it's a little harder to

482
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,710
use so you can do any remote code

483
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,110
execution on the device but if you screw

484
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,800
it up it wipes the device so that's not

485
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,689
so good

486
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,860
so most people don't know how to use

487
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,560
that aside from probably the crazy

488
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,570
Russian guy that that made it who again

489
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:21,010
doesn't exist so I'm assuming KGB at

490
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,689
this point but yeah so it's not good if

491
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,030
the ports available anywhere shut it

492
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,130
down Cisco finally recommended this and

493
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,170
like May of this year because there are

494
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,010
so many remote code execution

495
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,630
vulnerabilities on this protocol now

496
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,700
that they finally had to come back and

497
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,780
say it's not remote code execution

498
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,830
vulnerabilities if the product itself is

499
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,180
designed to do remote code execution

500
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,310
without authentication so great so

501
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,690
here's my unfortunate part I was going

502
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,460
to give you a slide of showing in showed

503
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,340
on how many things in Manitoba are

504
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,730
available with smart install but I found

505
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,919
out that was a really bad idea

506
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,510
long story short so please do not hack

507
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,840
all of the people in Manitoba that are

508
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:02,710
vulnerable to this right now just saying

509
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,169
please don't but you know crimes do get

510
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,690
prosecuted so and I'll probably get in

511
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,030
trouble too so yeah please don't you

512
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,870
know commit crimes but I do recommend

513
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:16,300
look

514
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:18,399
your own networks so the really

515
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,430
depressing one to talk about default

516
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,540
passwords are still common and I am

517
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,210
really not going to spend much time on

518
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,830
this slide but basically how to find

519
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,380
default passwords on a on a network

520
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,899
because people generally don't look at

521
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,910
them very often even in the pen testing

522
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,100
world we don't do as much as we probably

523
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,180
should sometimes so here's a great way

524
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,280
to find a bunch of them and it's

525
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,660
basically and map the network import the

526
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,090
results in the Metasploit because i'm

527
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,390
like the only person that loves the

528
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,459
Metasploit

529
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,830
management for hosts host and port

530
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,960
tracking and then you can use HTTP

531
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,449
screenshot to a screenshot every port

532
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,370
and I have a script that I believe is up

533
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,340
on my github otherwise I can put it up

534
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,320
there but basically it pulls all of your

535
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,199
results out of Metasploit for every web

536
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,370
port it runs it through HTTP screenshot

537
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,470
so you get a picture of every one of

538
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:10,239
them and I have it now to where it will

539
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,460
do adder buster on it so that it pulls

540
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,780
every subdirectory on the host and you

541
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,880
can see everything that's on the server

542
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,970
which is kind of nice but then it just

543
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,250
takes all those puts a puts into a web

544
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,990
page dot HTML and you can load it up on

545
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,940
your browser and look at every single

546
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,980
screenshot of every web page on the

547
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,690
internal network and then once you see

548
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,280
different things like an a PC console

549
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,760
you can try a default passwords really

550
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,260
quickly then of APC APC to get in and

551
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,480
it's pretty slick good unless you're on

552
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,220
a ridiculously large network I mean it

553
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,900
takes a couple hours to go through and

554
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,380
try default creds on every single web

555
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,400
page and I'm getting like 20 to 30%

556
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,640
crack with that which is kind of

557
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,020
depressing but yeah getting into 30% of

558
00:21:48,640 --> 00:22:00,070
your network with default passwords is

559
00:21:50,020 --> 00:22:02,530
fun so so LDAP so LDAP in Active

560
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,360
Directory is mostly secure I will say

561
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,280
portions of the GPO if you actually

562
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,439
monitor it are being sent plaintext from

563
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,710
the servers including the brand-new

564
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,710
latest windows I have caught credentials

565
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,740
plaintext once I still don't know why

566
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,940
but I think it's kind of random but just

567
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,470
so you know if you're ever monitoring

568
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,880
that you can find some good stuff so

569
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,010
make sure that you're not leaking weird

570
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,230
things out of plaintext epo

571
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,180
Active Directory accepts plaintext LDAP

572
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,360
passwords always has always probably

573
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:38,010
will already geez

574
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,570
alright so going even faster so it

575
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,470
accepts plaintext passwords so what I

576
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,760
recommend is mirroring that port have

577
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,000
your network team mirror the ports for

578
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,250
ad at least every you know a couple of

579
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,140
months six months a year whatever but

580
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,390
monitor it and dump so that you're

581
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,210
seeing if any admin has pointed like

582
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,840
Linux admins are great for this pointing

583
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,310
it at plaintext LDAP and sending all the

584
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,820
credits play in text across the network

585
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:07,919
not good so just kind of make sure that

586
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,590
they're not doing that don't install

587
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,030
Wireshark on the active directory server

588
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:18,959
because that you know reduces security

589
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,790
so I see that a lot but anyway yeah

590
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,240
watch your LDAP most pentesters aren't

591
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,129
going to test for that just because ARP

592
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,860
spoofing the domain controller usually

593
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,030
ends poorly on a network so try to check

594
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,110
that yourself because that doesn't mean

595
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:35,280
an attacker won't because they don't

596
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:38,100
care about housing downtime so Active

597
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,230
Directory system all shares are also

598
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,990
pretty common so you can go in and dump

599
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,460
there's a Metasploit module with it

600
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,550
looking for the C password and you can

601
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,230
dump out passwords right out of Active

602
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,850
Directory they have mostly closed this

603
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,140
but I still find it on a lot of systems

604
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:56,310
they can pull these C passwords out

605
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,620
there is a decoder built into Kali to

606
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:01,830
reverse those keys and you can dump the

607
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,850
plaintext passwords up very quickly and

608
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,760
you can find a lot of instructions

609
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,120
online to do that NFS I'm seeing more

610
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,740
and more NFS port 2049 is a network file

611
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,010
chair most people are using version 3

612
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,300
yeah yeah Mike shut up

613
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:21,570
most people he is in version 3 not

614
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,700
version 4 so version 4 supports

615
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,560
encryption and authentication version 3

616
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,100
does not so anybody using version 3

617
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,129
which is 99.99% are vulnerable so if you

618
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,020
can attach the share you can guaranteed

619
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,670
read write every file on there a lot of

620
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,200
people don't know this or have forgotten

621
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,519
it in

622
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,500
I had forgotten it for years and then

623
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,139
remembered it recently so I have

624
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,580
instructions here of how to actually I

625
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:47,250
guess partial instructions here in

626
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,100
partial on the next slide of how to read

627
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,309
write every file on a network file share

628
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:57,149
it's pretty easy basically whatever user

629
00:24:53,309 --> 00:25:00,330
owns the file so if it's owned by user

630
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:01,949
one two nine one you just create a user

631
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,379
on your own box that you've mounted from

632
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:09,149
and change them to one two nine one and

633
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,980
then su to that user in your side and go

634
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:12,299
to the file on the file share and you've

635
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,210
now owned the file and you can read

636
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,309
write modify it I'm seeing this 90% of

637
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,529
the time that NFS is being used its

638
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,059
backup servers so I can read/write and

639
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:22,950
modify your backups which is probably

640
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:26,399
not a good thing but it's really kind of

641
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,169
funny so getting into things like you

642
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,479
know people's home directories and dot

643
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,100
SSH and then pulling your authorized

644
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,130
keys down and then using those keys to

645
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,809
you know go and login and I guess

646
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,610
actually downloading the private key and

647
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:42,539
going to login but yeah you get you get

648
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:47,158
the idea and I'm assuming that is time

649
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:51,840
so all right one minute left any

650
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,429
questions yes lots of good stories but

651
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,350
probably not in one minute if you want

652
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:57,240
to meet me back there or chat with me

653
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,699
tomorrow I can give you lots of good

654
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,700
stories so yes

655
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:14,490
I have actually had defender catch me

656
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,320
once so it was surprising actually the

657
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,650
server the new server defender on the

658
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,179
newest Windows is decent and the next

659
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,200
iteration of Windows it's actually going

660
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,910
to be considerably harder which is going

661
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,990
to be interesting at least we say it's

662
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,250
going to be considerably harder it's

663
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,380
going to be interesting to see what that

664
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,240
actually turns out to be but I've heard

665
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,360
some very smart people say that it's

666
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,400
going to be considerably better so we'll

667
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,659
see yep

668
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,830
any other questions comments concerns

669
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,580
all right I'll be over there until they

670
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:52,449
throw me out

671
