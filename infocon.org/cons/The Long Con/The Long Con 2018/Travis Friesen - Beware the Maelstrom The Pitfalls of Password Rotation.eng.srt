1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,680
hello everyone thank you for having me

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,480
back at besides our society the

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,970
conference formerly known as besides

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,369
this is my second time presenting here

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,950
this is my second time presenting here

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,509
and those with good memories and sharp

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,550
eyes will notice a few things are

8
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:28,160
different about my talk this year

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,769
compared to last year first and foremost

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,500
my version of Windows is now activated

11
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:36,410
so I consider that yeah progress right

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,110
there the the tone of my talk has also

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,729
changed somewhat compared to last year

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,250
so last year being my first time

15
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:45,530
presenting at a security conference my

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,900
tone was kind of you know go easy on me

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,510
please don't hurt me be gentle and I'll

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,010
try to entertain you so one year has

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,659
passed and now I'm brimming with

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,299
confidence maybe a little bit too much

21
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:58,280
and now my tone is one more of you know

22
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:00,379
come get some right because if you don't

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,739
agree with me by the time this talk is

24
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,878
over haven't helped me I will fight you

25
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,780
and I when I say that I mean it

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,660
metaphorically okay let's be clear so

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,460
anyway um bit about me so typically BIOS

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,470
suck and I would tell you to just you

29
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,530
know read the handout or whatever but

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,380
Dylan you know accidentally left me off

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,420
the official pamphlet and the reality is

32
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,240
it doesn't behoove me to engage in an

33
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,900
opportunity of shameless self-promotion

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,759
so I'm actually here in two capacities

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,580
first and foremost I am the IT security

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,860
guy at Merlin so for those who aren't

37
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,750
familiar with Merlin we are the primary

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,440
provider of internet and Internet

39
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,390
services for education in Manitoba it's

40
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,600
great off a great job and in this role I

41
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,130
get to wear every single InfoSec hat

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,649
imaginable I do forensics I do incident

43
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,658
response pen testing policy the whole

44
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,460
shebang

45
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,650
but I'm also here as the co-founder of a

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,229
small IT firm called Flying Fortress IT

47
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:04,220
which I co-founded with that that Amazon

48
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:07,610
guy Mike himbo and together we try to

49
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,378
offer a cloud in security expertise to

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,230
small and medium businesses in Manitoba

51
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:14,120
so if you or someone you love is a small

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,489
or medium sized business in Manitoba and

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,810
needs to need some help kind of bridging

54
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,880
that skill gap you know you're not quite

55
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,260
big enough to justify having a full-time

56
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,150
IT security

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,470
come on give us a call we'll see what we

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,879
can do to help you okay so I'm here to

59
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,359
talk about passwords now I love

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,859
passwords wait no I hate passwords but I

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,510
love talking about passwords I love

62
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,150
studying passwords I find passwords

63
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,159
absolutely fascinating now when I say

64
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,680
that that sounds really really weird to

65
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,390
most you know normal people now just

66
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,340
probably not too many normal people here

67
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,529
but just in case nobody is on board

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,250
I love the study of passwords if you

69
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,019
will password ology so why is this so

70
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,659
fascinating well I got a little example

71
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,519
here so if we take a typical

72
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,489
traditionally good password like Steve

73
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,690
Ballmer's old password developers it's

74
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,700
traditionally good right it's 11

75
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,590
characters long upper case lower case

76
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,899
and it even has a special character

77
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,500
right according to password meter com

78
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,689
it's 65% or strong and and it'll take 97

79
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,730
years to crack right yeah that's we all

80
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:18,560
know that's right any any

81
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,879
pentester worth his or her salt will

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,709
tell you you know it's a it's a really

83
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,849
crappy passer right it's a common ish

84
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:27,919
dictionary word even in the the raw Q

85
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:29,480
password of the database right and it

86
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,690
follows a lot of common patterns right

87
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,578
so sure it has an uppercase but it's the

88
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,709
first letter right and and sure it has a

89
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:39,169
special character but it's an

90
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,909
exclamation mark and it's at the end of

91
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,919
the word right whereas whenever somebody

92
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,629
adds a special character to their

93
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,669
password it's almost always an

94
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,548
exclamation mark and it's almost always

95
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,690
at the end right so the upshot is that

96
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,340
if a hacker is trying to break this

97
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,599
password they're probably going to try

98
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,090
the word developers and they're probably

99
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,970
gonna try capital D developers with an

100
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,560
exclamation mark what do I find super

101
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,560
interesting is if I take that password

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,079
and I make one tiny little change to it

103
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,120
I move the the exclamation mark over a

104
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,159
couple of characters suddenly I've taken

105
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,930
a really crappy password and made it

106
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,030
substantially stronger and I'm still not

107
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,220
claiming it's a great password but it is

108
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,048
a lot better than the one before and

109
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,329
that's mostly because it's just no

110
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,798
longer following that those common

111
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,020
patterns of putting an exclamation mark

112
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,900
at the end right it's kind of breaking

113
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,240
the mold in that sense now I do believe

114
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,010
there are modules in hash cat that'll

115
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,750
that'll still get that there's one

116
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,349
little like move characters around and

117
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,430
 like that

118
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,930
so it's still crackable

119
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,840
but it's still substantially better than

120
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,640
it was before so this is why I find

121
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,140
passwords or password ology super

122
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,210
interesting right it's this this

123
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,640
confluence of you know human psychology

124
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,280
and computer science and mathematics all

125
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,219
coming together for this really

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,409
interesting field password ology the nd

127
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,950
mspaint skills are on full display here

128
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,990
today alright so Peters talk about

129
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,200
passwords what about passwords am i here

130
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,400
to say I'm not here to tell you how to

131
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,650
choose a good password heaven help me

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,469
we've beaten that correct horse to death

133
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,810
many many times I'm also not here to

134
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,580
tell you that passwords are dead usually

135
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,260
if somebody tells you or tries to tell

136
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,630
you that passwords are dead they're

137
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,580
probably a sales engineer and as we all

138
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,159
know sales engineers are the scum of the

139
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,780
earth so not making that claim in fact

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,720
reports of the death of passwords have

141
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:30,049
been grossly overstated quite quite

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,500
famously in 2011 IBM claimed that by

143
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,210
2016 five years later we'd never be

144
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,220
using a password again right but the

145
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,469
last time when I tried logging into IBM

146
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,570
calm slash support what do you need oh

147
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,940
it's a password right so good call on

148
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:49,700
that one IBM what's that

149
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:51,590
wishful that they're going for there's

150
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,990
also some noise about password lists

151
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,280
solutions but when you kind of dig into

152
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,200
them you realize they're not actually

153
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,789
password list who they are typically

154
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,950
doing is using another Authenticator

155
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,120
like say an email account as your

156
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,820
Authenticator so they're kind of almost

157
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,710
more more password outsourcing than

158
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,540
password lists and the advantage here is

159
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,450
convenience rather than actually

160
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:15,590
improving the security of passwords all

161
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,300
right yeah specifically I'm here to talk

162
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,539
a little passive rotation or more

163
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,180
specifically by passive rotation is back

164
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,400
or most specifically why mandatory

165
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,560
frequent pasión rotation which is to say

166
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,179
the passive rotation that exists in

167
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,190
pretty much every corporate environment

168
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,740
I've ever had to deal with not only

169
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,990
doesn't improve an organization's

170
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,320
security it actually actively inhibits

171
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,180
it it makes it substantially worse now I

172
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,830
hope you know these are this is a sample

173
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,450
of the InfoSec community in Winnipeg you

174
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,159
know probably a lot of you are already

175
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,800
on board this train but maybe some of

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,270
you aren't and even if you are this is a

177
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,370
sort of thing that that bears repeating

178
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,770
or something you can go and take back to

179
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,500
your IT admins and sysadmin and say hey

180
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:00,690
we should stop doing this because ABC

181
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,729
Sarah so a little bit of background

182
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,440
password rotation has been around

183
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,840
basically forever or at least since 1985

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,840
which is basically forever in terms of

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,690
internet time the Department of Defense

186
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,020
published a guide advocating password

187
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,310
rotation and the kind of you kind of

188
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,560
took off from there nobody's really sure

189
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,060
why it exploded the way it did but it

190
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,530
just kind of became standard practice

191
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,500
from there and it stayed that way for

192
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,840
more than 20 years until some fellow by

193
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,810
the name of Jean Spafford at serious

194
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,979
published a really great article

195
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,599
questioning hey why are we doing this

196
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,909
this doesn't actually help us when we

197
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,680
stop and think about it and as anybody

198
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:40,930
going against the you know common

199
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,259
orthodoxy of the day he was met with

200
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,930
Swift vitriolic and extremely ignorant

201
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,210
pushback the really good example is lob

202
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,370
saw the League of professional system

203
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,039
administrators we have an extremely

204
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,840
pretentious title published an article

205
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,669
in defense of password expiration that

206
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,219
really really demonstrated this pushback

207
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:05,590
so why is Pastor rotation not actually

208
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:07,779
helpful so the main rationale behind why

209
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,638
we do mandatory frequent pastor rotation

210
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,680
is is to limit the amount of time that

211
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,110
an attacker can use stolen credentials

212
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,520
to access your network now this sounds

213
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,750
like a great idea right like if you're

214
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,849
if you're constantly rotating your

215
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,740
password or your passwords you know an

216
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:22,539
attacker can only use a stolen password

217
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,810
to access your network for you know 30

218
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:29,590
days 60 days 90 days whatever right and

219
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,599
that makes a lot of sense in 1985 when

220
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,779
attackers techniques were you know very

221
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,098
very slow very manual and it took a lot

222
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,448
of time to do things right and I tended

223
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,899
to just kind of stick around the network

224
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:44,109
and not really miss things about but in

225
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,550
the modern day in 22 18 hear that that

226
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,470
doesn't make so much sense anymore right

227
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,599
like how long are you really comfortable

228
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,699
leaving an attacker have access to your

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,140
network are you comfortable with your to

230
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,849
an attacker being on your network for 30

231
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,380
days I'm sure not I'm not comfortable

232
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,029
having an attacker on my network for one

233
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,350
minute right how long does it take to

234
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:01,420
establish persistence or leave the

235
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,950
backdoor right or deploy cryptolocker

236
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,490
sure as hell doesn't take 30 days to do

237
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,730
that anymore and in fact a couple of

238
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,490
former NSA ta operatives have come out

239
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,590
and said yeah you know in our experience

240
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:18,480
hacking other nation-states passive

241
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:21,340
rotation is never inhibited us even once

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,100
and the idea being that if you've

243
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,210
changed your password you now safe

244
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,560
doesn't really help too much when the

245
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,720
people are doing it all the time right

246
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,250
and because when somebody changes their

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,160
password if I still have their old

248
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,840
password I have this huge insight into

249
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,280
what they're typically what they

250
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,170
typically choose for a password you know

251
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,660
I know what their new password looks

252
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,339
like or I have a good idea so a very

253
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,670
simple example right if a user's old

254
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,960
password was red Honda 11 how much do

255
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,469
you want to bet their next password is

256
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,380
red Honda

257
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,510
12 or red Honda 1 1 1 or or whatever

258
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,280
right and then you might say well we

259
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,560
could put rules in place this is often

260
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,449
the the approach to fixing these sorts

261
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,579
of problems is well we can put password

262
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,930
generation rules in place so that you

263
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,090
know a certain number of characters have

264
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,500
to be different well ok then the user

265
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,960
will just choose a password that's like

266
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,610
orange Toyota 11 right or still follow

267
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:16,270
some sort of predictable pattern and

268
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,800
then ultimately just in a larger sense

269
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,140
making you just change passwords

270
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,030
frequently just makes it harder for them

271
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,620
to remember passwords right users hate

272
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,689
changing the passwords frequency I don't

273
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,610
know if you guys have spoken to a user

274
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,780
recently it's it's a terrible thing and

275
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,340
I don't blame them I hate doing it

276
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,839
myself and ultimately yeah they choose

277
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,550
proper passwords that are shorter and

278
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,290
easier to remember and are therefore

279
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,390
easier to guess and crack for an

280
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,209
adversary this has been known for a long

281
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,189
time Adams and SAS back in 1999

282
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,630
published a paper about this but it was

283
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,090
largely ignored and we just kind of

284
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,410
tribes gone with it and it'll also lead

285
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,300
to more frequent occurrences of other

286
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,760
problems like writing down passwords or

287
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,170
storing them in securely you know text

288
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,680
files or spreadsheets and that sort of

289
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,030
thing it also puts a drain on your your

290
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,189
helpdesk right because people will be

291
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,870
more likely to phone in say hey I forgot

292
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,920
my password because I had to change it

293
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,350
to days they're going over what I

294
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,900
changed it to so ultimately it's it's

295
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,660
much better to have longer more secure

296
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,250
passwords that never or rarely expire

297
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,319
right and it also

298
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,410
you an opportunity to sell that right if

299
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,240
if you disable pastor rotation but up

300
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,650
your complexity requirements right

301
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,610
people are less likely to complain

302
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:29,170
because they only have to remember a

303
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,460
password once now and the reality is

304
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,880
past rotation is just it's

305
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,680
computationally expensive for users now

306
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,420
users aren't stupid welcome

307
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,069
some users are stupid but most users

308
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,589
aren't stupid right alright I kind of

309
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,350
resist that narrative however I do think

310
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,240
users are a little bit lazy and when I

311
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,250
say that I don't mean that disparagingly

312
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,300
I actually kind of you know respect that

313
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,090
right because if you're a little bit

314
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,250
lazy you're less likely to waste time

315
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,080
doing something pointless or worthless

316
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,240
so it actually has it has value to our

317
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,100
organization if your users are just just

318
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,750
a little bit lazy and because they're

319
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,570
lazy and they have to deal with all

320
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,160
these requirements and and advice they

321
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:09,250
take shortcuts right this is this is the

322
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,199
reality but it's not just that it

323
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,210
doesn't help my argument is stronger

324
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,270
than that I'm saying pastor rotation

325
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,560
actually makes things worse right so if

326
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,900
your if your users are changing their

327
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,030
passwords every 30 days well what else

328
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,850
changes every 30 days I don't know maybe

329
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,310
maybe the month changes every 30 days or

330
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,740
90 days maybe the seasons change every

331
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,989
90 days and so I've seen this time and

332
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,400
again you see a lot of common repeated

333
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,040
patterns right you'll see a lot of users

334
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,829
who use passwords like November 2018 or

335
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,410
fall 2018 or other passwords following a

336
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,420
very very similar similar pattern and

337
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,819
these again these are traditionally good

338
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,170
passwords they're long they have capital

339
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,660
letters some of them have special

340
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,550
characters even right most password you

341
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,569
know requirements are met with these

342
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,520
really crappy passwords so in my

343
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,890
experience in admittedly somewhat

344
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,140
limited experience I found that about

345
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,960
two to three percent of users in an

346
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,120
environment with their forcing password

347
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,800
rotation on a regular basis will have

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,390
passwords that fall into a pattern

349
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,479
somewhat like this you know fall or

350
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:16,870
November 2018 now two to three percent

351
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,820
doesn't sound like a lot but in an

352
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,880
organization of just one hundred users

353
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,620
you're almost guaranteed that at least

354
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,750
one of them will have a password that

355
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,720
fits this pattern right and if that user

356
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,899
has VPN access well you know there's a

357
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,970
organization from the outside in fact

358
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:36,160
this is such a common problem that I've

359
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,949
run into time and again I made my maid a

360
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,110
tool for generating passwords that that

361
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,279
fit this pattern depending on what time

362
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,110
of year it is that I'm doing the

363
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,300
engagement be welcome to check it out I

364
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,160
called it password vortex because I have

365
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,258
a flair for the dramatic and you can

366
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,860
download it check it out please don't

367
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:55,779
make fun with my terrible coding skills

368
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,879
no I've just ragging on pasture rotation

369
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:00,670
for the past five ten minutes I will be

370
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,310
grudgingly admit that it has a little

371
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,319
bit of an upside and that is if you're

372
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,779
using if you're forcing passive rotation

373
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,189
it does cause users if they're if

374
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,660
they're reusing their password from

375
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:12,279
their social accounts for their

376
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,170
professional accounts it does kind of

377
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,589
cause that to eventually kind of diverge

378
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,420
and and sort of lose sync and that's

379
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,819
good I mean users aren't supposed to

380
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,560
reuse passwords but they do and so this

381
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,180
does help with that but we still have

382
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,219
the same problem as before right if

383
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,069
they're if their social media password

384
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,120
is red Toyota 11 then you know what's a

385
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,309
good chance that their corporate

386
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,579
password is something like red Toyota 12

387
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:38,589
so if as an adversary I gain their

388
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,959
social media passwords through leak or

389
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,360
social engineering or whatever again I

390
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,989
have a huge hint into what that users

391
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,459
corporate password probably looks like I

392
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,629
also think there's maybe a better way of

393
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:54,128
dealing with this problem

394
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:56,740
but I'll come back to that so this kind

395
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:58,839
of persisted after 2006 until about 2009

396
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,699
2010 that's when we really started to

397
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,680
see some some pushback from experts in

398
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,500
the community and it kind of started

399
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,680
with the the first academic research was

400
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,660
published in 2010 by by a bunch of

401
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,089
researchers actually I forgot where they

402
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,059
were from well the security of modern

403
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,370
password expiration and the fact that we

404
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:20,529
finally had quantifiable academic or

405
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,209
research really went a long way into

406
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,430
allowing you know allowing the experts

407
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:27,579
to push back against this you know

408
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,019
perceived wisdom so Bruce Schneier

409
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,040
started weighing in other experts sans

410
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,970
waiting on it and said hey we should

411
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,399
stop doing this

412
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,470
Lori Craner who was pretty awesome

413
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,809
although I think I got her name wrong

414
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,160
former professor of computer science and

415
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,620
chief technologists of

416
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,329
the FTC has been quite vocal about this

417
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,860
as well and in fact shortly after she

418
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,008
started her role as the chief

419
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,290
technologist of the FTC somebody in

420
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,940
charge of the Twitter account posted a

421
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,980
tweet saying hey remember to change your

422
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,899
passwords frequently and she had to you

423
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,370
know step in and kind of lay the

424
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:04,839
smackdown on that one the GCHQ um they

425
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,899
changed their tune back in January of

426
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:12,490
2016 and NIST followed suit about a year

427
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:14,620
later in in 2017 so even though these

428
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,170
these big names like Bruce Schneier and

429
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,750
sands and NIST and GCHQ are all saying

430
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,910
hey don't do this anymore there are a

431
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,740
lot of examples of organizations who've

432
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,959
know better who ostensibly deal in

433
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,790
security who are still recommending that

434
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:30,699
we do this place is like like managed

435
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,399
engine the pide evolutions networks all

436
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,910
of these are our firms that deal with

437
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,370
security and some of them quite

438
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,719
humorously evolutions deals and password

439
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,000
management and privileged access

440
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,170
management still doesn't know better

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,850
right these guys are supposed to be

442
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,490
experts and you're still recommending

443
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,019
this I got to the second page of Google

444
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,569
results and I got tired of doing this so

445
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:51,160
the reality is you can just you can find

446
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:54,790
no shortage of firms that are still

447
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,500
recommending this practice Microsoft

448
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,649
seems to be of two minds about this

449
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,439
maybe not quite a typically they see

450
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:04,209
they officially say not to use mandatory

451
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,250
password rotation in fact it was some

452
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,900
Microsoft researchers where some of the

453
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,079
early ones leading the charge against it

454
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,669
but even though they officially say that

455
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,069
the default value for maximum password

456
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,449
age on a domain controller is four to

457
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,069
two days right that's still the default

458
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,470
and if you dig into the Microsoft

459
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,658
documents it flat-out says best

460
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,289
practices set maximum password age to

461
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:27,909
between 30 and 90 days so maybe it's a

462
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:29,919
symptom of being a large organization

463
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:32,010
like Microsoft but the right hand seems

464
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,039
to not know what the left hand is doing

465
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,120
so I consider this the most egregious

466
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,919
example of the Center for Internet

467
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,139
Security publishes a lot of great

468
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,179
documents benchmarks and security

469
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,740
controls they're still on board the

470
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,690
mandatory pastor rotation is a good idea

471
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,720
train and they don't seem to want to get

472
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,230
off not sure why but hopefully that'll

473
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,240
change soon and of course you can't look

474
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,820
to your governments as examples of what

475
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,609
to do with

476
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,658
a certain federal government whom I will

477
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,899
not name but we're all very familiar

478
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:04,369
with it still recommends or requires a

479
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:06,219
minimum of eight character password that

480
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:08,439
needs to be changed every few months

481
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,389
within a certain provincial government

482
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,369
seven characters 90 days same with a

483
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:16,059
certain municipal government is also

484
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:18,879
seven characters and in 90 days I

485
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,129
singled out the government of BC here

486
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:23,570
for also having a bad policy but I

487
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:25,219
wanted to mention them because they'll

488
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,379
all right publish this information they

489
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,330
have a great set of documents if you're

490
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:31,428
looking to create a security standard

491
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,279
for organization there have great

492
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,690
documents good for modeling after except

493
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:40,009
for the fact that they have really poor

494
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:42,200
passer requirements alright time for a

495
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:45,080
quick story so I was working with this

496
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,019
one organization great organization they

497
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,279
really got their head on straight

498
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,599
they're trying to improve their their

499
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,220
security so they brought me in to kind

500
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,320
of do a pen test and assessment and help

501
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,669
them out and as part of the pen test I

502
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,859
was able to leverage the fact that they

503
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,929
were using mandatory password rotation

504
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:02,059
to crack their perimeter and get onto

505
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,679
the network so afterwards you know we're

506
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,908
doing the after-action the debriefing of

507
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,440
how did I breaking this up and I did

508
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,269
explain to them why this is a bad thing

509
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,609
and how I was able to leverage it and

510
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:12,820
they said okay Travis we hear what

511
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:15,408
you're saying we understand the problem

512
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,119
we'll change it from 30 days to 60 a

513
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:19,549
mass maximum password rotation that's

514
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,539
just like no no that's you didn't

515
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:22,489
understand it at all

516
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,259
eventually they came around but this

517
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:26,929
just kind of goes to illustrate just how

518
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:28,879
ingrained this idea that passive

519
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,799
rotation is a necessary thing rather

520
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:32,840
even when faced directly with the

521
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,070
evidence the idea was just let's just

522
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,178
make it long fair right that doesn't

523
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:40,519
really solve the problem so the National

524
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,859
question is well if 30 days or 60 days

525
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,809
of 90 days is far too short well when

526
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,549
how long should it be should I do it at

527
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,408
all should I never change my passwords

528
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:49,789
well and the obvious answer is you know

529
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:52,039
if you sue if you suspect you've been

530
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,109
compromised change your passwords I mean

531
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:56,299
that kind of goes without saying some

532
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,928
people say you know do one year do two

533
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:01,489
years and this helps it avoids some of

534
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,739
the problems of having those common

535
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:06,639
patterns or where users are choosing

536
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:09,480
really really weak passwords pardon me

537
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:11,040
but it's kind of like what's the

538
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,050
then because remember that the main

539
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,310
reason is that we want to limit the

540
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,899
amount of time an attacker can use

541
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,940
stolen credentials on a network right

542
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,430
and and one year as a hell of a long

543
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,940
time to let an attacker muck about on

544
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,500
your network if you pressure me and say

545
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,050
how long should it be Travis I kind of

546
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,700
go I don't really know because even

547
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,010
though I just talked about how posture

548
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,270
rotation is terrible if you came up to

549
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,680
me and told me that you were using a

550
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,110
password the same password for you know

551
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,450
10 15 years I'd probably go you might

552
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,379
want to change that right it's even I

553
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,430
have a hard time letting go of that idea

554
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,080
so can we do better than pass the

555
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,180
rotation yes absolutely

556
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,470
it's called account monitoring user

557
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,720
based analytics and all that sort of

558
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,630
thing what that actually looks like

559
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,280
we're side of the scope of this talk

560
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,290
multi-factor authentication also would

561
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,980
go a long way to improving this problem

562
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,450
you don't really need to rotate

563
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,400
passwords if we have multi factors yeah

564
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,720
that kind of likes that problem of

565
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,280
course is that multi-factor

566
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,960
authentication doesn't really work in

567
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,420
Windows Active Directory environments

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,450
again that's another issue way outside

569
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,060
the scope of this talk so one idea that

570
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,010
I like I'm kind of kicking around

571
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,899
tentatively is the idea of password

572
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,950
audits and that is you you have a

573
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,930
professional come in or you do this

574
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,630
yourself and take your password database

575
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,270
securely of course and you try to crack

576
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,500
the passwords contained therein and

577
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,480
basically you're doing the same thing to

578
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,860
your password database that in modern

579
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,050
adversary what you're using the same

580
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,570
tools and techniques and identifying

581
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,120
which passwords are likely to fall in

582
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,679
the event of a compromised and the idea

583
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,520
is to kind of try to pick off the the

584
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,560
lowest hanging fruit

585
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,510
you know Bureau which passwords are

586
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,010
actually weak according to you know

587
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,700
objective metrics instead of just

588
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,960
guessing now the idea it's very

589
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,580
important that we want to use this as a

590
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,280
teaching moment we don't want to shame

591
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,419
users for having a strong password but

592
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,180
it does give us the ability to

593
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,340
concretely say hey you have a weak

594
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,780
password because you did you know you're

595
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,340
using a dictionary word you know please

596
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,040
don't do that here's how a better way of

597
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,330
choosing a password right and the idea

598
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,580
is is make sure that you're

599
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,879
communicating with your users when doing

600
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:17,010
this now this is a lot of organizations

601
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,840
may not be familiar with you know what's

602
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,430
how to crack passwords or they don't

603
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,199
have the resources to build their own

604
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,080
password cracking rig which

605
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,700
a lot of money but you know we can do

606
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,620
this with AWS and you know maybe

607
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,430
somebody can give you a hand with that

608
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,840
if you if you need so I do have some

609
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,880
bonus slides but I don't think I have

610
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,939
time for bonus slides no I do not have

611
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:54,300
time for mones slides so we'll go into

612
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:55,710
the questions you were first yes I think

613
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:24,180
you may have missed the the point of my

614
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:25,890
talk but yeah I can see some value in

615
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,400
that because you you avoid the pitfalls

616
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:33,290
of having them choosing weak passwords

617
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,440
or fall or following common patterns but

618
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,820
how much would that really help well

619
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,380
dubious I mean if the password gets

620
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,360
outright stolen through a keylogger I

621
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,860
guess and and with an automated service

622
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,870
I guess you can set it up to rotate the

623
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,790
passwords daily or whatever right so I

624
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,919
would see that house as having some

625
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,510
value and because it's basically free

626
00:23:49,920 --> 00:24:01,760
with an automated service I guess yeah

627
00:23:51,510 --> 00:24:01,760
turn it on why not okay

628
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,920
yes

629
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,539
yes rainbow tables also good times I'm

630
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,539
even kicked off the stage sorry Moz

631
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,279
[Applause]
