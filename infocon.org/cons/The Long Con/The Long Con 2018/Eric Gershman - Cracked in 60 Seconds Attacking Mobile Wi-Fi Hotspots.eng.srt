1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:15,010
so first things first why did I pick

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,120
gone in 60 seconds so those who may not

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,700
know me

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,670
I'm a bit of a car nerd this was at the

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:24,269
DEF CON Harbor hack car hacking village

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,609
and they had like a challenge to

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,619
basically take apart a car and find the

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,960
input ports and at this point I was

9
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,110
under the bumper of the car like seeing

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,000
if I could access the some of the

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,040
sensors there for the airbag and they're

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,190
like no no no we didn't mean take it

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,629
apart for real so yeah so the reason I

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,059
picked gone 60 seconds is because

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:52,089
there's a lot of parallels between this

16
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:55,209
topic and the movie Gone in 60 seconds

17
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,649
is about speed and so can hacking and I

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,590
want to mention that sometimes it takes

19
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:03,100
longer than 60 seconds in the movie the

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:08,860
in the original movie the last car to

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,330
get to get to to get stolen I was gonna

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,110
I was gonna say jacked but I didn't know

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,880
if that was right um that one it takes

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,229
like 60 seconds for the guy to get in

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:26,380
and then the car chase is for 45 minutes

26
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:28,270
so so the first thing the first example

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,908
we're going to go over is a wireless

28
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,140
assessment that I had to do I had a

29
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:36,939
really limited a scope pen test where

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,399
instead of you know instead of 60

31
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,829
seconds I had it 24 hours it was still

32
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,409
really short in retrospect it was also

33
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,240
pretty limited in that uh there were

34
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,250
there were just corporate users

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,439
connected to Wi-Fi hotspots

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,530
so my attack surface was just the

37
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,529
hotspot so those of you who may be

38
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,200
familiar with those know that the only

39
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:04,539
real attack surface is the password the

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,840
pre sure key so we're gonna go over a

41
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:11,850
little bit about attacking WPA preacher

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,410
keys the authentication for WPA PSK

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,720
happens using a four way handshake that

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,510
happens either periodically or in the

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,810
first authentication the

46
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:27,409
the session encryption key is calculated

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:32,060
using info including the SSID the pre

48
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:34,760
share key and a one-time number a nonce

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,030
from the client and the access point and

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,190
this is to prevent replay attacks an

51
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,900
attacker can who can observe the full

52
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:48,470
handshake is able to take that session

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,370
and then and then perform a brute-force

54
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,680
attack against it one thing I do want to

55
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,470
mention is you may be asking well how

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,280
can you make this faster and one way is

57
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,799
to force a Rihanna keishon by sending ad

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,359
authentication frame as the access point

59
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,040
and that'll cause the client to

60
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:11,870
disconnect and then Rihanna Cate

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,629
so now that we have the background down

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:20,329
let's do this let's start looking at

63
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:25,120
attacking it so yeah okay yeah let's

64
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:31,489
write okay a few more times are you good

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,079
okay so so maybe maybe asking like Eric

66
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,359
are you a script kiddie why are you

67
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,370
using Wi-Fi to and I'm using it because

68
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,010
it's a really good tool for learning and

69
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,919
for trying to attack out first if I was

70
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,500
teaching it using just aircrack-ng it

71
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,250
would it gets a bit complicated also

72
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,079
it's been rewritten just show what's

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,129
happening during each step of the attack

74
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:56,840
and finally there's a there's oh I just

75
00:03:55,129 --> 00:04:02,120
mentioned it the debug options let you

76
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:07,040
see each step so using Wi-Fi - I started

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:13,909
it in it starts in scanning mode and no

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:15,108
I'm not gonna walk over there I'm not

79
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:19,310
using my pointer because I'll just like

80
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:21,530
shake like like you know you guys trust

81
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,220
me trust me it'll just be like a laser

82
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,960
point like going all over the screen but

83
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,010
anyways this is the first step with

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,570
Wi-Fi - it shows the the the SS IDs of

85
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,340
all the networks that are available I

86
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,949
picked the first one which is the ver

87
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,280
in my fight that I'm targeting and it

88
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:45,560
starts ad authentication attack well it

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,799
starts observing the the network on that

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,389
channel and looks for authentication

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,080
handshakes when it doesn't see the

92
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,690
handshake

93
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,900
it goes through and it actually sends a

94
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,360
D authentication if it finds a client

95
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,150
it'll send it to one of the clients if

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,919
it doesn't find a client it'll send it

97
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,840
to broadcast and try and do authenticate

98
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,690
all clients I really want to mention

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,359
this because that's one downside with

100
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,700
Wi-Fi too you can like denial a service

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,580
a whole network with it so in this case

102
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,729
it dedicated the client and then it went

103
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,669
and successfully captured the handshake

104
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,530
and save the handshake so now that I

105
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,650
have the handshake let's try to crack it

106
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,869
well let's try to recover the password

107
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,870
most hotspots have a default random PSK

108
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,210
and I started wondering if I could find

109
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,070
the format so I looked for the model

110
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,520
number the model number was in the SSID

111
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,680
it was public info it was clear text so

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,250
I did recon on the model number and

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,229
started looking I looked for looked for

114
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,229
documentation I didn't find it I started

115
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:54,889
googling and I came across josh josh

116
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:57,919
writes twenty ten posts on kind of the

117
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:01,340
same thing it was attacking Verizon MiFi

118
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,159
hot spots this is eight years ago and he

119
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,799
was able to find a flaw in the format of

120
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,410
the pre share key and and exploit that

121
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,210
to use technology from all the way back

122
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,479
then to recover the hash in a short

123
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,750
amount of time so that that got me

124
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,240
motivated I kept looking until finally I

125
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,090
started looking at YouTube I was like

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,120
well people do unboxing videos what if

127
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,250
like in the unboxing video the pre share

128
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,380
key is in there because it's on a screen

129
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,410
that's like hidden so I started looking

130
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,289
through and sure enough there was some

131
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,580
YouTube video from from Russia where a

132
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,370
guy was giving a review I couldn't

133
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,440
understand him but a little a little

134
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,310
more than halfway through he shows the

135
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,760
screen of of the setup page I'm just

136
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,990
gonna

137
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:54,870
so she shows the screen on the setup

138
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:57,960
page and it has the yeah to loud okay

139
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,090
how's this good so he shows the screen

140
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,340
on the setup page and I was able to get

141
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,570
the format of the preacher key what

142
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:11,359
format does this look like hex yeah it's

143
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:15,360
8 hexadecimal characters so using math

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,080
combinatorics in particular we can

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,520
figure out how long it'll take and this

146
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,169
is where I kind of dive a little bit

147
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,520
into storytime because it reminded me of

148
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,430
of something that happened with roommate

149
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,770
in college my roommate and I we were

150
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:39,060
kind of paranoid well I was paranoid

151
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:40,890
honestly he was a film major and I ended

152
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,020
up buying one of those security locks

153
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,780
for my laptop it was a Kensington cable

154
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,340
lock with like a lock and a key and he

155
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,960
was like oh that looks really cool

156
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,919
you're pretty paranoid but that's cool

157
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:57,690
why don't I get a combination one and he

158
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,550
said that uh he set it up he he created

159
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,440
a code and I don't know if he didn't

160
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,610
trust me or something but he never wrote

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,520
the code down so later on a week goes by

162
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,750
he never he goes to unlock his laptop

163
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,609
because he wants to go work in the

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,890
library and he can't remember the code

165
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,440
and he's like do I have to break my

166
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,450
laptop my new laptop how do I get into

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,870
this thing so he calls Kensington

168
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,659
support and they say well just try all

169
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,350
possible codes he's like no that can't

170
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,240
be that easy

171
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,560
and there's like trust us if you go

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,090
through all of it it's like less than an

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,039
hour it's like oh okay

174
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,409
so he goes through and you gotta try

175
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,400
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one

176
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,620
and so on

177
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,929
and then sure enough within like 30

178
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,310
minutes he had the thing a lot it's like

179
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:46,260
oh that's not so secure is it so in this

180
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,150
case it's kind of the same thing but

181
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,460
instead of the four digits we have the

182
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,140
eight hexadecimal characters so we

183
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,510
looked through hexadecimal characters of

184
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,410
zero through nine and A through F that's

185
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,089
16 possible combinations and it comes

186
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,629
out to a little over 4

187
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:07,410
know the number of the key space or the

188
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:10,160
amount of the key space using hash cap

189
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:15,540
we can we can research or I researched

190
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,600
how fast my GPU can crack wpa2 and I

191
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,819
looked it was a GTX 970 which was

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,290
released all the way back in 2014 so

193
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:24,029
it's a little old and I was able to find

194
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:29,309
benchmarks published by the hash cat

195
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:33,569
team and it came out too for that that

196
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:36,240
key space and it came out to a hundred

197
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:39,479
and seventy three thousand hashes per

198
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,399
second so taking the key space of will

199
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,009
over four billion dividing it by the

200
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,620
hashes per second gave me about seven

201
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,290
hours and that's the worst case scenario

202
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,209
that's if I have to get to the end of

203
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,269
the key space to actually recover the

204
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:56,638
key so now that we have like the math

205
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:59,490
down and I at this point I had the

206
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,680
confidence to actually go for it because

207
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,870
I only have 24 hours am I going to

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,779
actually finish this assessment before I

209
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,879
have to fly out I I went through and I

210
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,420
started running the hash cat attack and

211
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,040
in this case it's gonna be a mask attack

212
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,099
these are the options for a mask attack

213
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,379
I want to go over a little bit you don't

214
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,059
need to focus on actually on fully

215
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:24,480
understanding this I just wanted to show

216
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:27,689
that you know option a is the mask the

217
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,679
mask itaú the attack method then we're

218
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,670
doing wpa2

219
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:35,129
that's the hash file the 4 Way handshake

220
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:38,370
capture and then finally a the important

221
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:40,230
part is the format of the mask so you're

222
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,389
doing - one to say that you want to

223
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:46,199
define a custom mask and you're saying

224
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:48,179
question mark digits and then ABCDEF so

225
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,639
that's all the hex character sets and

226
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:58,050
then finally we're saying it's eight

227
00:10:50,639 --> 00:11:00,329
characters so using hash cat it started

228
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,069
and it was really close to my estimate

229
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:07,109
it was at seven hours so I was feeling

230
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:08,939
pretty confident at this point I woke up

231
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,009
the next morning and it was it was

232
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:13,079
recovered it was cracked in less than

233
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,310
four hours so it was less than

234
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:22,950
half the time this is how hash CAD

235
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:26,579
displays the plaintext so at this point

236
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,230
I was able to connect the hotspot and do

237
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,850
the configuration of the flying I was

238
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,080
able to compromise the host server

239
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,430
server message block so at this point I

240
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,450
basically made it through the assessment

241
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:42,689
and provide a lot of value to the client

242
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,330
but one thing later on after I realized

243
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:49,230
it left me with quite a few questions

244
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:52,200
the first one was how how overlooked is

245
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,230
this so I had a Verizon hotspot in the

246
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,870
fast or not a Verizon but a generic

247
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,150
mobile hotspot in the past and I left

248
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,290
the default key there because I looked

249
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,170
at it I was like oh that should be

250
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,719
secure enough and I didn't at the time I

251
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:12,030
didn't really understand the math behind

252
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,110
the attacking passwords like that so I'm

253
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,980
wondering how many other people have

254
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,200
done that and then I also want to know

255
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,880
is this widespread is this systemic

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,700
is it happening across a lot of devices

257
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,560
and is it happening across to newer

258
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,960
devices because this one's pretty old

259
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,650
and then finally is it being actively

260
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,320
exploited our people are our attackers

261
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,240
truck malicious people actually using

262
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,340
these flaws to connect to networks and

263
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,680
compromised systems so what I did is

264
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,110
while I was traveling as a consultant

265
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,969
and and going to conferences going to

266
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,470
airports I started casually scanning

267
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:54,960
using Weigel and/or wiggle and and using

268
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,630
just the default Wi-Fi apps and I kept

269
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,690
seeing that same hotspot this one in the

270
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,510
example which is from 2014 there were

271
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,270
plenty of examples this one was actually

272
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,850
at my tiny airport of like four gates

273
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,100
there were two of them nearby and then

274
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,500
this one was at a conference there were

275
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,330
about four or five that I noticed so

276
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:22,530
it's still in use today so the next

277
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:24,960
thing is is it being exploited and I

278
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,449
start googling a lot more as you do and

279
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,850
I found

280
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:34,100
- killer co uk which is a a forum and a

281
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,060
hash recovery service and one of the

282
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:42,170
services they offer is recovering wpa

283
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,839
hashes it's used to primarily used for

284
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,569
testing the security of your network but

285
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,050
anyone can go on here and pay to get on

286
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:54,020
a network that they want to that that

287
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,540
they want to access and they listed a

288
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,630
large number of routers and then they

289
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,689
listed them by by duration and how

290
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,910
difficult it would take so I was like oh

291
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,770
that's probably because some of these

292
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,990
routers are more secure than others like

293
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:12,290
some of them have more complex keys and

294
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,770
then I looked and they they actually had

295
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:19,459
a list of all the default routers they

296
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:26,900
could find in all the formats and going

297
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:29,900
back from - 2015 I believe and then I

298
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,760
also saw that on the hash Gap forums

299
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,340
they were targeting weaker algorithms

300
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,260
and working together to reverse the

301
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,480
routers to see if they could drop that

302
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,210
entropy and drop the recovery time and

303
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,280
in some cases it looks like they were

304
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:48,470
able to make it so it only took them

305
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,680
take some minutes or seconds to recover

306
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:54,560
a key and then I also looked they had a

307
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,969
form recovery service on their public

308
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,699
side where people can post the four-way

309
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:09,800
handshake and ask members on the forum

310
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:12,020
to recover it and pardon me and members

311
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,609
will come on and they'll they'll kind of

312
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,620
race each other to see to be the first

313
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,740
one to crack it and provide it and then

314
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,830
ask for a donation in this case it's I

315
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,210
wanted to point it out because well

316
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,980
actually I'll cover it later so but

317
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:33,410
first I wanted to go into another

318
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,510
example I had so at this point I my

319
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,819
interest was really piqued so I started

320
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,160
buying random hot spots one of them I

321
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,930
came across was the Alcatel link zone

322
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,839
and it's one of the most affordable hot

323
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,870
spots to get it's used actively by two

324
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,759
networks in the US and the documentation

325
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,399
actually contained the pre share peep

326
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,240
format I started searching and I looked

327
00:15:52,399 --> 00:16:01,009
on t-mobile's website and it talks about

328
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:04,069
the SSID and the SSID contains the last

329
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:07,670
four digits of the IMEI number

330
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:10,219
oh that's useful the password contains

331
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,279
the last eight digits of the IMEI number

332
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,540
oh okay that should help a lot and it's

333
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,939
your through nine characters so it's

334
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,699
even easier than the Wi-Fi hotspot we

335
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:23,540
were looking at so I look at it and I

336
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:25,160
look at the IMEI format and the first

337
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,709
digit looks like it's almost always

338
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,019
static so it's almost always zero

339
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:32,989
because it's used to indicate like the

340
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,089
type of IMEI number it is the next three

341
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,939
digits are just zero through nine and

342
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:40,250
then the last four digits are just in

343
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:43,550
the SSID so you already have them

344
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,430
available so all we're doing is we're

345
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:52,099
trying to crack in this particular case

346
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:54,469
we're trying to crack or three ten digit

347
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,500
numbers which comes down to just a

348
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:04,339
thousand possibilities so it's really

349
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:06,109
fast so one thing you might want to

350
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:10,549
might be asking is what about other

351
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:13,609
devices these the pre shared key

352
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:15,109
generation methods are pretty systemic

353
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,539
across all devices that I looked at you

354
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,099
can just look at the list from hash

355
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:23,510
killer and you can look on your own and

356
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:26,829
one of the ones I came across was in

357
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:31,460
that previous example in the forum post

358
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:34,190
you'll see that the format is Bell and

359
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,559
then three digits and that's the SSID

360
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:40,150
format so it's one of the routers that's

361
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:45,110
used for Bell Canada the home hub fast

362
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:47,240
fast routers and there there's people on

363
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,240
the hash pillar forum who are actively

364
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,490
recovering handshakes for the routers

365
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,010
that are that are deployed for home you

366
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:01,800
know

367
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:03,600
in in ISPs like like Bell and Rogers so

368
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:10,610
how many on-time who's actually keeping

369
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,610
different oh you are okay thanks Ron

370
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,750
okay so the main takeaway I wanted to

371
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,640
talk about was that uh that the default

372
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,660
randomly generated passwords are not

373
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,120
secured forever

374
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,020
if you go back to when my five hotspots

375
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,060
were first released over in 2000 in 2008

376
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,830
they were using these formats and

377
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,710
they're still using them today

378
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,159
and at that point in 2008 one really

379
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,730
interesting thing happened the password

380
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,800
cracking kind of had a huge breakthrough

381
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,710
because GPUs were starting to be used

382
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,480
and that dropped the key recovery time

383
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,910
and that's one of the reasons that this

384
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,460
is so easy now the big question I have

385
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,860
is why don't they move on to better

386
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,240
longer passwords in some cases I've seen

387
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,250
that they have they moved to 12

388
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,980
characters which is significantly harder

389
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:02,160
but in most they haven't the

390
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,270
recommendations that I have for for

391
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,510
basically the practitioners the

392
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:10,320
corporations is to adopt a zero trust

393
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:13,379
model so your users connecting to walk

394
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,669
by now untrusted Wi-Fi networks

395
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,800
shouldn't be trusted

396
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,290
shouldn't sure they should be protected

397
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,560
against any network they connect to

398
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,600
whether it be a public access point or a

399
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,490
hotspot that they're using and then

400
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:31,260
these hotspots really should should you

401
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,230
should change the default password and

402
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,580
the SSID for the hotspots disable

403
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,470
unnecessary services on the endpoints

404
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,439
decreased or further further limit the

405
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,750
attacks surface by blocking any unused

406
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,610
services or white listing them and then

407
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,430
finally when you're using VPN or

408
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:57,330
deploying VPN disable split tunnel VPN

409
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:58,860
connections so with that thank you thank

410
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,879
you long con this is great

411
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,439
this is a great opportunity and if how

412
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,290
much time do I have

413
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,640
three minutes yeah I could do that all

414
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,240
right let's see if we can do a demo in

415
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:18,390
three minutes

416
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:22,050
Oh two minutes oh yeah you got me you

417
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,580
got me in the talked to sixty seconds so

418
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,149
I should be able to do this in 60

419
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:31,790
seconds

420
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:33,180
Oh oh no I have to my hands too sweaty

421
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:39,450
okay there we go

422
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:41,220
cool yeah it was a really secure all

423
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,320
right so first we're gonna run Wi-Fi and

424
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,690
we're gonna run the kill option to kill

425
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,220
the the network interface manager the

426
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,680
network manager and we're only going to

427
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,230
look at hot spots that have clients

428
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,900
connected so these are all the hot spots

429
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,980
here that uh that currently have it one

430
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:08,190
or two clients you're cutting into my 60

431
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:11,430
seconds come on I can do this okay in

432
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,310
interest of time I'm gonna stop this and

433
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:19,620
scroll up because I did this like before

434
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:21,929
I got here so here's the hot spot it

435
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,100
went through and it recovered the

436
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,320
handshake pretty quickly

437
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,290
by using a DI authentication attack and

438
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,850
then it tried to crack it using the weak

439
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,570
passwords that are built in and didn't

440
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,520
work it saved the handshake so I went

441
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:39,960
through and now that we have the

442
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:43,650
handshake let's create a word list for

443
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,870
the possible pass phrases so it's a

444
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:50,130
thousand combinations like we looked at

445
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:55,530
before and now that we have the word

446
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:57,450
list I'm going to copy it off to windows

447
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:04,110
because that's even faster than trying

448
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:05,910
to run this in a VM and then I'm gonna

449
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,490
use air crack in this case instead of

450
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:13,770
hash because this thing does not have a

451
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:17,090
GPU so I'm using air crack and I gave it

452
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:29,120
the word list the handshake

453
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:31,280
and and that's it so that was a demo

454
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:41,360
fail so we're gonna go to the screenshot

455
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:45,950
I saved oh I found the key thank you so

456
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,870
when I ran this before oh I have it here

457
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,520
so I'm gonna leave it on for as long as

458
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,580
I can if you want to try recovering it

459
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,320
and throughout the weekend and I just

460
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,699
wanted to let you know it took like less

461
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,679
than a second it just showed it

462
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,820
instantly when I want to practice this

463
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:06,040
but thanks everybody I'm at a time right

464
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,040
[Applause]
