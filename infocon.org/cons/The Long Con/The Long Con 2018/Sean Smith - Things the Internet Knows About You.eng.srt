1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,860
Thanks

2
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:13,809
say yeah my my name is Shawn Smith I'm

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,390
the director of architecture a company

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,189
called security scorecard security

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,330
scorecard goes and collects a lot of

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,970
information on the internet either

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,849
directly through active scanning or from

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,340
third parties and we then take that to

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,920
construct customers digital footprints

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,930
and surface bunch of issues for them and

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,489
try to distill that down till a letter

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,530
grade around what their public security

13
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,089
posture is but I'm not really here to

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,289
talk about what scary squirt core does

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,980
I'm here to talk about some of the

16
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:43,839
information underneath so you know there

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,568
there are a lot of companies that go and

18
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:49,870
collect information on the Internet

19
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:51,550
all this data is actually is generally

20
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,010
available for the right price and in

21
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,940
many cases the right price is zero

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,039
dollars especially if you're a

23
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,190
researcher so what what sort of things

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,940
can we do with that so some additional

25
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,199
constraints all data that I'm gonna pull

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,850
up it's gonna be found with the domain

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,798
name I'm not here to talk about showed

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,750
and i/o or you know of course I can

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
search for things and turn up all sorts

30
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,310
of things on the internet will show down

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,830
and so all data must be acquired without

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,930
triggering any packets where is the

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,640
target so there are a lot of tools where

34
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,320
you can you know type in a domain or

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,270
whatnot and I'll go and do a scan for

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,589
you I'm not here to talk about any of

37
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,899
those I'm here to talk about what data

38
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,730
sets that people are collecting they

39
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,250
were just sitting in on some server

40
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:37,870
somewhere I rest that anyone can just go

41
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,790
and pour through so I lots of people are

42
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,140
using this Daiso resource researchers

43
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,400
are obviously using these because

44
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,800
they're they're the ones producing these

45
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,380
data sets there's the security ratings

46
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,110
space which security court security

47
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,140
scorecard is in that is using all this

48
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,870
data to put forth companies public

49
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,270
security postures and cyber insurance

50
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,060
companies are using this data to dictate

51
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:06,399
how much companies are gonna pay them

52
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:09,429
for a cyber insurance policy and more so

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,230
so who may benefit from this if you're

54
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,159
on like the red team maybe you want to

55
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,200
go and look through some of this

56
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,170
information to collect some information

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,299
before you know and engage the target on

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,280
the blue team side

59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,840
perhaps you're interested in what the

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,570
internet knows about you because they're

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,360
using it to sort of evaluate some of

62
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,980
your work in a sense and if you're just

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,170
a researcher someone who likes looking

64
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,000
at data you know you can quickly go and

65
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,100
through some of this data and check your

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,960
hypothesis or quickly gauge the

67
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,340
potential impact of some exploiting the

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,800
internet when it comes out without

69
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,290
actually having to go and collect that

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,820
information yourself and do it over a

71
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,049
period months so you can actually see

72
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,570
turning data all right so first is of

73
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,890
course DNS a DNS is cornerstone the

74
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,769
Internet of course you can find out a

75
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,820
lot of things about an organization from

76
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:04,060
from the DNS so is our individuals going

77
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,160
and collecting vast quantities of DNS

78
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,750
information yes

79
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,790
so rapid7 is the primary large data

80
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,970
source that we use or for DNS

81
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,519
information so they do both reverse DNS

82
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,530
scans where they're just scanning PTR

83
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,570
records on the ipv4 space every month

84
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:28,120
and they're feeding that and watch of

85
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:30,130
other things into 4d DNS scans and so

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,820
they're sending on like this vast trove

87
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:37,990
of DNS information which anyone can go

88
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:40,060
through and then so there are newer

89
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,240
files are actually pretty large so for

90
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,790
more ad hoc stuff I actually use this

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,030
this tool called security trails which

92
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,459
has which is essentially another one of

93
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,940
those SAS products where you can just go

94
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,070
and put in put in a search string and so

95
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,690
for example I can put security scorecard

96
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,190
into that and you know of course so put

97
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,590
in of course they'll give me back a

98
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:07,090
bunch of subdomains everyone will have

99
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,980
subdomains this isn't complete so not

100
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,630
all these all these data sets are not

101
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,060
necessarily going to be complete but

102
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,740
they have a lot of information well

103
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,880
let's see what some some interesting

104
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,470
things I can pull up are so for example

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,110
when when going through this information

106
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,419
at one point I stumbled across these

107
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,020
records for Ohio children's hospitals so

108
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:32,299
I was I was looking at whether or not in

109
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,719
it whether or not organizations

110
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,370
there are MX records set up correctly so

111
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,920
from here I found out that so the this

112
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,740
organization has a number of MX records

113
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,630
set up so it looks like they've actually

114
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,580
migrated through several different email

115
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,950
providers or over the course of the

116
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,560
years with the with the latest one here

117
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,210
being Outlook so it looks like they're

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,450
on Outlook right now but they have all

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,890
they have all these older ones here and

120
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,599
then going through like looking at

121
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,120
historical data for that for that first

122
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,830
one o hotmail dot org which is

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,980
presumably themself hosting their own

124
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,080
email at one point so using this tool I

125
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,540
see a that the last time they saw any

126
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,020
any record for that was like two years

127
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,030
ago it's like ah so actually of course

128
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,060
that is available for registration right

129
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,369
now so conceivably like I could go and

130
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,290
register that and while in this case

131
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,600
it's very unlikely that I'll get their

132
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,450
email because of the prior two vimax

133
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,070
like what what are what

134
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,560
misconfigurations two other companies

135
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:41,360
have are there some where they have

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,470
failed to to remove entries that no

137
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,910
longer resolved is something that

138
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,300
actually have higher priority where I

139
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:51,220
could go and register that and then just

140
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,950
happen to get any emails sent to them

141
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,500
alright and this tool also has txt

142
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,000
records I find txt Rutgers fascinating

143
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,980
there's a lot of really interesting

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,280
information this is really this is

145
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,230
really hard to see here so so I had to

146
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,679
cheat briefly and actually do a jig to

147
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:14,540
bring that up in a usable fashion so so

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,530
48 for DNS like I'm not looking I'm not

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,790
just finding information about an

150
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,099
organization I'm finding out what other

151
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,830
organizations that organization is

152
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,160
dealing with so from the MX record like

153
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,740
it's very easy to see who who's hosting

154
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,910
their mail um and then for for txt

155
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,870
Rutgers I can find out a lot of

156
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:38,510
information so for example here it

157
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,820
indicates as QB scorecard is using

158
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,900
company called Bala meal for the recipe

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,040
for

160
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,260
setting up the recipe F and I know Val

161
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,850
Emil is an organization that that helps

162
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,190
other organizations roll out Demark

163
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,890
policies so I know security scorecard is

164
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,870
using that and then like going down

165
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,900
farther there's this interesting ones so

166
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,850
there's Atlassian domain verification so

167
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,830
and then it turns out so this this

168
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:07,790
actually means that security scorecard

169
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:11,550
is using JIRA as a cloud product and

170
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:14,670
there's there's this is a pretty common

171
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,410
practice actually so going going through

172
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,600
a lot of data like I've seen stuff Rado

173
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,120
because adobe has or online photoshop

174
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,580
product and they use the strategy cisco

175
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,190
and Citrix Dropbox has done it for our

176
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,409
organizations Facebook does it for some

177
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,320
reason run entirely sure sure why

178
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,700
offhand Global sign whether or not

179
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,980
someone signed up for have I've been

180
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,560
poned for the organization send cloud

181
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,900
almost all the email providers to prove

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,520
that you own a domain and like the list

183
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,469
just goes on and on and then when doing

184
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,870
some investigation so this is another

185
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:52,440
isn't interesting one I turned it turned

186
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,010
up this subdomain which kind of which

187
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,860
resolves to a private internal DNS

188
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,520
number as I wonder I wonder how many

189
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,620
people do that

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,799
and then use so using that tool like I

191
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,370
can search for 10.0.0.0

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,200
and so based on what we saw in the

193
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,280
information address there's like seven

194
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,340
thousand one hundred thirty-seven

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,809
results actually kind of wonder now if I

196
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,810
could just do a range and see how many

197
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,300
results are but like but this shows that

198
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,570
all a number of organizations are sort

199
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:29,100
of leaking there are internal internal

200
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:32,330
DNS through external means and so what

201
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,490
could somebody conceivably do with that

202
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,430
all right say summarize DNS you know DNS

203
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,930
contains lots of information about you

204
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,260
as well as the companies you do business

205
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:45,810
business with some people are really

206
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,330
slow to clean up DNS after migrating and

207
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:52,050
some people are leaking internal IP

208
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:54,780
addresses so I'm going to move on to TLS

209
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,199
certificates which is another area I

210
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,900
find

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,180
interesting so first first there's

212
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,069
certificate transparency so certificate

213
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,339
transparency is the thing that Google

214
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,950
has rolled out as a response to them

215
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,230
being frustrated with certificate

216
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:14,220
authorities message miss issuing

217
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,350
certificates so as you may be aware like

218
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,240
recently Symantec doesn't issue

219
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:23,000
certificates anymore and others are

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,520
trusted and before that happened like

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,420
Google essentially forced them to put

222
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,579
all their certificates through

223
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,890
certificate transparency and now

224
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,140
actually they require Austrian

225
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,930
authorities to essentially have

226
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,810
certificates pushed and to sort of get

227
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,699
transparency logs as a result that means

228
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,329
that certificate transparency logs are

229
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,130
now essentially a log of all the

230
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,250
certificates that should be exposed on

231
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,340
the Internet

232
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:56,900
so I can you know type in security

233
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:59,910
scorecard comm and I get a list of

234
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:04,530
certificates that have reason that I've

235
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:07,410
been issued for us within our log and

236
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,569
chronological order so so it seems here

237
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,850
that recently we had a bunch of service

238
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,260
issued so I can go through and actually

239
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,140
look at some of the information here so

240
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,520
these are cloud for SSL's because you

241
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,630
know security scorecard happens to be

242
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,069
using cloud from there or another

243
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:25,890
another Association companies I'm going

244
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,210
through like CloudFlare issues you know

245
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,710
certificates with a lot of sans and

246
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:34,830
there we are nestled between Russia and

247
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:38,640
Ballet history and bike shop italia and

248
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,740
you know did I miss a source so there

249
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,840
there's there is a an organization

250
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,420
called census which sorta does the same

251
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,660
thing in allows you to view a full text

252
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,790
search so I can I can go and and get the

253
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,199
sort of same results in there and you

254
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,530
know you'll also see that you know

255
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,560
there's there there's gets issued by

256
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,480
Amazon as well alright but you can also

257
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,579
do more interesting things because it's

258
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,980
a log and like all the details of in the

259
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,530
log people are starting to use okay

260
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,520
transparency to detect pushing domains

261
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,470
because

262
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,390
you know you want you're trying to evoke

263
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,940
a certain amount of trust that you're

264
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,680
trying to spoof a URL that means that

265
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,280
you're gonna have you're likely to have

266
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,660
part of someone's organizational name

267
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,939
and that URL so like sure enough like I

268
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,770
can I can sure search census for things

269
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,140
that have PayPal and I'll get

270
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,270
interesting things like so when someone

271
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:40,770
registered your account PayPal has been

272
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:45,430
blocked dot flammond area america.com or

273
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,720
this other PayPal one and you'll notice

274
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,880
that these are let's encrypt

275
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,370
certificates because like lesson less

276
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,500
encrypt doesn't doesn't really do a

277
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,270
whole lot of verification is they don't

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,300
think it's their job and I largely agree

279
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,699
with that their their primary purpose is

280
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,930
just to you have more secure

281
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,930
communication on the Internet

282
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,670
all right and then past certificate

283
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,500
transparency there are actually a number

284
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,469
of organizations that are actively

285
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,300
scanning the internet for TLS services

286
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,040
so they you know there are a lot most

287
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,079
services that use TLS or on common ports

288
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,270
they're going through and scanning those

289
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,010
and knocking on those doors and seeing

290
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:32,470
her response and so rapid7 is of course

291
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,330
doing that as well

292
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,500
security scorecard is we're doing

293
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,850
ourselves as well

294
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,210
so I I think there's a lot of

295
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,000
interesting information there and and

296
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:47,820
remember it's not just HTTP that uses

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,470
TLS it's all sorts of other things and

298
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,490
all right here's my census slide so

299
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,670
census so you so you can you can you can

300
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,220
search and you'll actually bring up

301
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,900
hosts that's ship gates are found on and

302
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,800
so I think an interesting property of

303
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,020
TLS certificates and the usage of them

304
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,469
on the internet so you can you can query

305
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,689
things by AP on services and if they

306
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,320
give back a tell us from akid that TLS

307
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,720
certificate is going to have the all the

308
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,150
all the all the names that the

309
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,500
certificate is useful for

310
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,930
the certificate itself so that is

311
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,570
actually an association between an IP

312
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,449
address and an organization because you

313
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:35,080
haven't have a TLS certificate that

314
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:38,140
references your organization or not and

315
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,660
a security scorecard this actually comes

316
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,160
up fairly fairly frequently with some of

317
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,770
our customers we have customers that

318
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,810
come and talk to us and the like this I

319
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,270
peep doesn't belong to us this is some

320
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,829
third party that we use like three years

321
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,160
ago and that we're no longer do business

322
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,900
with and it's like well you know there's

323
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,890
still there's still a certificate that

324
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,829
you used to use on host right now so if

325
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:05,980
that wasn't cleaned up what else wasn't

326
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,170
cleaned up on that machine and and

327
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,790
that's not certainly a good good

328
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,780
conversation and the customer is usually

329
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:16,360
like oh I don't know and so they

330
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,010
actually go back to they go back to the

331
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,440
hosting provider and try to figure out

332
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,090
like what's still on there what they use

333
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,820
it for in the first place because in

334
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,440
many cases like turnover like who knows

335
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,330
who knows what that thing was used like

336
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,740
three years ago I can barely remember

337
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,850
what some machine I set up a year ago

338
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:40,320
still does and then and then get that

339
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:43,390
cleaned up alright so so that's that's

340
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,330
an overview of what we're using for TLS

341
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:49,020
for so certainly transparency can show

342
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:52,300
who's issuing certificates for you or

343
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:56,079
reveal potential phishing attacks or

344
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,060
other things and then active TLS scans

345
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,770
can reveal associations between an

346
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,290
organization and some random IP on the

347
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:08,290
internet right now web scanning web

348
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,329
scanning is an area that we've been

349
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:14,439
spending a lot more time in recently

350
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,720
because information or like everybody

351
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,190
has a website there are tons of people

352
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,260
crawling in those websites or sorts of

353
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,650
information those web sites so there's

354
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,870
this - there's two big repositories of

355
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,610
freely available web crawls that I'm

356
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,000
currently aware of so one is common

357
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,220
crawl and the next is the HTTP archive

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,620
where the HTTP archive is actually the

359
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,850
data set that powers the Wayback Machine

360
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,529
that they just recently decided to give

361
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,589
people access to you and you can

362
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:47,110
actually query this through the Google

363
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,640
Big Data Platform so you don't even need

364
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,540
to download this and do it yourself like

365
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,189
all the data's all the data is there and

366
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,770
then additionally we work with this

367
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,830
company called their name isn't actually

368
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,890
here so Netta graph which is a research

369
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:06,220
organization that's more interested in

370
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,170
the associations between a website and

371
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,390
their learner parties so they're largely

372
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,959
privacy oriented what's still pretty

373
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,880
interesting um so what's what sort of

374
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,470
things might you be interested in when

375
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,990
looking at web crawl data so one one one

376
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,690
thing we do we take a look at we take a

377
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:31,510
look at the prevalence of of web header

378
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:35,050
of response headers so this is this is

379
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:38,500
just like some the top headers that I

380
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,359
saw or some period data in our cases

381
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,430
where we're largely looking for for

382
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,709
things like expired by to see what

383
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:49,000
technologies are in use or you know the

384
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:50,380
security headers here so for example

385
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,790
maybe you're interested in what

386
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:59,920
aspersions are are essentially

387
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,810
announcing themself on the internet so

388
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,569
this is somebody else's research

389
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:08,948
research where they they took a set of

390
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:12,178
scans and and actually ordered by the

391
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:16,170
the prevalence of the version number er

392
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:18,760
maybe you're interested in the number of

393
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,270
websites that have vulnerable JavaScript

394
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:28,690
and yes that is hovering near 80 percent

395
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:31,809
or maybe your privacy oriented and

396
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,940
you're interested in what organizations

397
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,379
are setting persistent tracking cookies

398
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:41,679
so that the kid track your activity

399
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,330
across the Internet I know that's really

400
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,160
that's really just the tip of the

401
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,928
iceberg there's tons and tons of things

402
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,640
that you can do with web crawling do I

403
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:52,150
think it's I think it's really

404
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,340
a big goldmine for for taking a look at

405
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:58,450
what's available there obviously your

406
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:00,610
footprint is available there since the

407
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,770
web browser is web probably is going to

408
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,389
pick up the your sites that are

409
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,920
essentially of available and link to on

410
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,750
the internet whether or not you know

411
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:15,070
about them or not someone else certainly

412
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:18,250
does as well as potentially covering a

413
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,740
subset of services you use all right so

414
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,040
mapping it all out so one of the things

415
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,960
I did with this data is okay so I can

416
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,430
draw I can draw a relationship between

417
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,620
one organization and another

418
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,800
organization which means that I can draw

419
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,020
a relationship between one organization

420
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,570
their intermediary and that another

421
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,910
organization was like why don't I just

422
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:43,270
why don't I just map all this out so

423
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:46,030
this is this is actually nfl.com and the

424
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,240
services they use spiraling out to the

425
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:51,970
services that their services they use

426
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,220
and so I mean there are some pretty

427
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,260
obvious clusters here so like Google

428
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,450
Google's over here because you know

429
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,180
everybody uses Google for email and

430
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,770
everything else interestingly like a

431
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,500
number a number of people in this chain

432
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:10,780
or using box comm there is double click

433
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,090
so a number a number of people in this

434
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:19,420
chain or using double-click for ads a

435
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:21,790
number of things with global sign yeah

436
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,440
and then and then I can actually do I

437
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,389
can actually do the reverse so this is

438
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
this is the number of people that

439
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,420
actually rely on nfl.com

440
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,770
and not surprising it is the it is all

441
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,870
the NFL sports teams and then so here

442
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,760
here's another one so this is this is

443
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,310
Atlassian so this is a little bit more

444
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,430
sparse but you still see you still see

445
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,480
google.com it's pretty prevalent

446
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:51,280
double-click is pretty prevalent and

447
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,930
then then reversing this you know I last

448
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,680
seen clearly has a lot of customers that

449
00:19:52,930 --> 00:20:00,900
are easily able to be picked out just

450
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,900
through some very very simple techniques

451
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,430
all right so wrapping up there is tons

452
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,379
of historical data available on your

453
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,200
additional footprint on the Internet

454
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,470
this includes services that you're using

455
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,600
in 3rd parties you're interacting with

456
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:20,470
it's really accessible and easily

457
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,300
processable and large volumes so let's

458
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:27,860
think about what other people could

459
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:32,490
possibly do with it that's it thank you

460
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:39,639
[Applause]

461
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:49,270
so quick question sorry I can't I can't

462
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:53,470
actually hear it sorry I still I still

463
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:56,770
can't actually hear you yeah come closer

464
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:24,490
come closer and or like if we have

465
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:26,590
enough do you have another mic so the

466
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,130
question is is there information around

467
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,510
who who the registrar's are for the DNR

468
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,120
stuff for things like phishing attacks

469
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,140
and whatnot I'm I'm quite confident the

470
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,820
answer is yes

471
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,300
I just haven't looked and I haven't

472
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,210
really looked into that area myself but

473
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:47,680
yeah I am 100% certain that the

474
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:50,160
information is there all right cool

475
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,160
thank you everyone

476
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:57,559
[Applause]
