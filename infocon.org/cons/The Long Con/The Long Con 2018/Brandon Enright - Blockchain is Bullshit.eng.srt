1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:14,580
so awesome guy

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:19,170
and he even gives a talk so Thank You

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,950
Brendon everything Ron said is a lie

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,950
this guy's an idiot

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:30,420
all right so III think you know most of

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,790
us work in some sort of technology field

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,199
most of us are the types of people that

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,750
are our friends and family members come

9
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:40,500
to for advice on anything technology

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,050
related and surely in the last probably

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,829
18 months you've heard non-stop

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,199
blockchain this blockchain that I think

13
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,579
we've all heard it and I think there's a

14
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:56,730
time in a place for a blockchain and

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:58,230
that time in place is never so my talk

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,760
blockchain is why blockchain

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,178
technology will not solve any

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,950
significant technology problems this is

19
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,750
me apparently I should include a bunch

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,679
of other things like I swallowed magnets

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,130
and that sort of stuff

22
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:15,810
but that'll have to do

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,399
so I have a bunch of fine print for this

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,289
talk because whenever you say something

25
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:22,380
is you need a lot of fine print

26
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:24,990
so first of all I'm not Satoshi Nakamoto

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,190
the allegations are not true I do not

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,410
wear golden sunglasses this talk is not

29
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,840
about cryptocurrencies right some

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,238
cryptocurrencies are kind of neat I not

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,590
talking about from a money perspective

32
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,509
but just from a technological

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,630
perspective a lot of cryptocurrencies

34
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,380
are pretty cool aetherium is one of the

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,500
really really interesting ones

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,720
blockchains

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,239
actually solve some problems the

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,619
cryptocurrencies have so so if there's

39
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,700
one area where a blockchain is not

40
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,259
 it would be encrypted

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,789
currencies never mind that all

42
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,060
cryptocurrencies are at least most of

43
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,869
them are scams we'll just ignore that I

44
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,509
have no idea what I'm talking about

45
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,039
honestly I have a blunt I had a bunch of

46
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,959
ideas for why block chains are

47
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,360
without any concrete information or

48
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,860
evidence and so I did a bunch of

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,940
research and I found out that none of my

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,959
ideas are unique they've all been

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,829
written out written about before and so

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,450
you're not gonna learn anything if you

53
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,099
keep up on this stuff this talk will not

54
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,119
teach you anything because it's all been

55
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,319
written about before this presentation

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,469
does not

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,409
select the views of my employer I don't

58
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,299
need to say any more there this

59
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,730
presentation will not help you buy

60
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,810
bitcoins but coin scam coins or Ponzi

61
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,719
coins or any other coin this

62
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,700
presentation is way too late right I

63
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,888
should have been talking to you at the

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,268
peak of the hype but no I'm talking to

65
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,939
you down where there's no more hype

66
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,299
so I've already talking about something

67
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,430
that everyone's moved on with the US

68
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,109
NIST in the process of me doing research

69
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,239
for this presentation completely

70
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,209
obsoleted my entire presentation by

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,739
releasing this flow chart that basically

72
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,000
asks you a bunch of questions and then

73
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,469
tells you that you do not need a

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,530
blockchain for every single question

75
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,090
right it's so after you pass every one

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,069
of those which no one could ever pass

77
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,099
you finally need a blockchain down at

78
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,780
the bottom the if I know you can't read

79
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,358
this but it's the answer is database

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,689
database database database like the

81
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,159
every single time I have a bonus just

82
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:28,828
for the long con I'm gonna be giving

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,810
away three thousand ETH just send point

84
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:36,120
one eth to my address and I'll send you

85
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,419
back ten this presentation might be a

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,159
scam this talk is for entertainment

87
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:47,159
purposes only no Warren trees express or

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:49,560
implied already so watching hype I could

89
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,769
just talk for 45 minutes with green

90
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,650
shots on all the insanity surrounding

91
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:58,439
blockchain but I chose to select just a

92
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,439
small number of examples to illustrate

93
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,030
what I think the problem is so Atari is

94
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,989
a video game company I think we've all

95
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,400
experienced or at least played some

96
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,079
Atari games or at least know the impact

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,879
that Ataris had and we all I think know

98
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,819
that Atari has been in financial trouble

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,769
for a very long time and Atari fought

100
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,108
actually kind of correctly if you look

101
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,989
at the graph of their stock that if they

102
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:25,169
released not just one but two different

103
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,250
blockchain like coin token things that

104
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,770
it would do well for them so they

105
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,780
launched atari token and pong token at

106
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,340
the same time and the data they

107
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,080
announced this their stock shot up by

108
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,940
something like 50% amazing kodak another

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,310
failing company decided that they were

110
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,940
going to

111
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,290
Kodaka coin and if you look at the you

112
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,880
know all the sort of the the great

113
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,230
things that they say about Kodak poin it

114
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,990
is the absolute buzzword bingo

115
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,330
so and if anyone is is playing along at

116
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,120
home or playing you know in the audience

117
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,859
in with an actual bingo card also I have

118
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,360
for you a cloud-based decider ABT

119
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,390
machine learning behavioral anomaly

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,130
detection so I think we actually just

121
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,070
covered every buzzword that there is and

122
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,020
that sentence that I just uttered was an

123
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,740
actually complete sentence what has

124
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:19,870
happened to our industry so if you

125
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:22,060
Google IBM blockchain Google actually

126
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,580
helpfully recommends a bunch of other

127
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,440
things that people search for Walmart

128
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,060
blockchain maersk blockchain Oracle

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,440
blockchain Deloitte blockchain ASAP

130
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,940
blockchain Microsoft blockchain

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,710
Accenture block change Lego blockchain

132
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,160
that one's the only joke by the way Lego

133
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,900
blockchain Amazon blockchain Facebook

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,550
put blockchain Samsung blockchain Toyota

135
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,039
blockchain I mean and and like I could I

136
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,750
I only had one slide to waste on this

137
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,920
kind of craft like it just goes on and

138
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:52,390
on and on and on and on so every one

139
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,850
tiny startup you know municipality small

140
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,770
government random entrepreneur big

141
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,410
gigantic you know conglomerate company

142
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,180
everyone has has at some point jumped on

143
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,630
the blockchain bandwagon or is planning

144
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:11,260
on doing it so everyone gets a

145
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:14,020
blockchain so what the hell is a

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,340
blockchain and this is where the talk is

147
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,770
gonna get a little bit technical and I

148
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,940
think most people that know anything

149
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,210
about walk chains know a little bit

150
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,980
about hashing and sha-256 and proof of

151
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,190
works and that sort of thing and I skip

152
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,590
all of that so I want I want you to take

153
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,420
away from this talk is some sort of

154
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,219
semblance and of idea of what a

155
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,360
blockchain is without really getting you

156
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,580
bogged down in a lot of the technical

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,340
details so this is gonna be a very

158
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,870
high-level description so first of all

159
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,250
it looks like you're trying to fulfill

160
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,410
your anarcho-capitalist or libertarian

161
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,100
fantasy by creating your own money would

162
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,100
you like an algorithm

163
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:54,620
so a cryptocurrency is basically two

164
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:58,220
things a cryptocurrency is a protocol

165
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,530
and it's some data structure that

166
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,630
interacts with that protocol in order to

167
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,409
produce something that is a money like

168
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,210
thing I'm completely ignoring the

169
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,380
protocol aspect of these things because

170
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,239
again this talk is not about

171
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,219
cryptocurrencies this talk is about

172
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,229
block chains and block chains were

173
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,389
effectively invented to solve

174
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,590
cryptocurrency problems and now people

175
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,409
think that they apply to a bunch of

176
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,630
other issues so I'm going to talk about

177
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,280
block chains here and I'm going to take

178
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,169
the approach that you know sorts of

179
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,960
suppose suppose you want to make your

180
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,549
own money what would you need to do and

181
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,900
we'll talk about some of the components

182
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,460
that are needed and why the design

183
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,340
decisions have been made the way they've

184
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,448
been made so you're trying to make your

185
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,039
money you want no centralized Authority

186
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,409
you want it to be fully distributed you

187
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,900
know peer-to-peer you don't want any

188
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:50,479
bank or government or other centralized

189
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,729
Authority write it which is not does not

190
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,060
match traditional money so you don't

191
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:59,449
want any trusted users you want some

192
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,490
semblance of anonymity and anonymity is

193
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:03,229
very hard to define especially in in

194
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,820
most cryptocurrencies where they claim

195
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,060
that this anonymous and it's really not

196
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,400
anonymous in any way at all you want

197
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,919
immutable or irreversible transactions

198
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,448
so you don't want if I take virtual

199
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,979
money out of my virtual wallet and hand

200
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,210
it to you you don't want me to ever be

201
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,789
able to take it back right that that's

202
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,380
supposed to be an immutable transaction

203
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,090
and you want it all to be secure and

204
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,280
when people say secure they really mean

205
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:30,500
secured by math and that basically means

206
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,919
cryptography so blockchain is an

207
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,828
algorithm for tackling these details and

208
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,990
it when you read anything about block

209
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:41,120
chains you will probably feel stupid and

210
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,399
that's not because you're stupid unlike

211
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,899
this gentleman it's because walk chains

212
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,970
are complicated and there's a lot of

213
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,100
they're couched in a lot of complicated

214
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,490
jargon and complicated terminology that

215
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,699
is mostly irrelevant so you want to keep

216
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,589
track of money build a ledger any

217
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:59,449
accountant or anyone who is familiar

218
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,110
with accounting or familiar with finance

219
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:03,199
in general has

220
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,269
some idea of what a ledger is if you're

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,700
if you're not familiar it's kind of like

222
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:13,750
venmo will only lamer this is also known

223
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:19,040
as spreadsheet technology right so

224
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:21,769
spreadsheets so you wanna you want all

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,689
transactions to be secured by math well

226
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:27,950
sign all the transactions and this is

227
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:30,140
known as RSA technology so it's simple

228
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,610
right even has a public key and a

229
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,610
private key and and so does a bunch of

230
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,560
other people so Eve signs a transaction

231
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,899
so that you can't just say you can't

232
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,399
just write on the ledger Eve you know

233
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,160
Eve pays Cori

234
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,649
100 dollars that's not a valid statement

235
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,100
you know Eve pays Cori $100 signed by

236
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,079
Eve's

237
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,420
public or a private key that's a valid

238
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,859
statement this is simple everyone

239
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,760
understands digital signatures even if

240
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,040
they don't understand the math behind

241
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,300
them and it just turns out that if you

242
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,610
sign everything you solve most problems

243
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,740
that that block chains are trying to

244
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,720
solve and Matthew likes this transaction

245
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,779
because I guess this is 2018 we have to

246
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,160
be able to like these things so you

247
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,689
don't want replayable transactions you

248
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,149
don't want you don't want Corey to be

249
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,399
able to copy Eve pays Cori or hundred

250
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,079
dollars multiple times so that Eve is

251
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,380
now paying Cori a thousand dollars that

252
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:21,279
that would be bad and so we add a nonce

253
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,079
this is also known as non sticky and

254
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,329
Ananse is just a number and it's really

255
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,459
any number and so non stands for number

256
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:30,769
used once so we just number these

257
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:32,510
transactions and so transaction one Eve

258
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,490
pays Cori $100

259
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,110
you can't copy that because that numbers

260
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,110
already been used and so you would need

261
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,089
transaction two Eve pays Cori $100 but

262
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,000
Eve did not sign that she only signed

263
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,470
transaction 1 Eve his quarry $100 so

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,970
that's no good you know you can't copy

265
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:53,660
that so that makes everything not

266
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:56,149
replayable anymore so what happens if

267
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,560
you don't want to trust anyone at all

268
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,790
with the ledger right because normally

269
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,140
with a ledger there's someone who's

270
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,180
actually making the entries in the

271
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,760
ledger what if you live in a world where

272
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,099
no one trusts anyone here's a video of

273
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,550
or an image of such world because Trust

274
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,270
sucks

275
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,620
so let's not trust anyone so at up to

276
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,740
this point in the talk I have not talked

277
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,340
about blocks or chain

278
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:23,040
so so where is the block chain aspect of

279
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:24,840
this talk so if everyone has if so so if

280
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,209
you force everyone to keep a copy of

281
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,500
their own ledger so I over here right

282
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,210
you know the answer to this problem is

283
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,340
says have everyone keep their own ledger

284
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,320
alright but that doesn't actually solve

285
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,570
any problems because then who has the

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,850
official ledger how did the ledger stay

287
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,910
in sync and how can we waste as much

288
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,610
energy and computing power as possible

289
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,420
right so ask yourself those three

290
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,250
questions and then we have an answer so

291
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,750
we add a proof of commitment and this is

292
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,730
also known as global warming technology

293
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,290
so the person with the the law it's a

294
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,050
simple rule the person with the longest

295
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,599
ledger has the official one and so

296
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,699
whoever has the longest ledger is just

297
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,290
the official ledger keeper and any time

298
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,550
someone makes their ledger longer and

299
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,589
now they're the official ledger keeper

300
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,180
and everyone's sort of sharing whatever

301
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,580
their ledger is with everyone and

302
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,469
everyone just uses whatever the longest

303
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,470
one is and all this will make a little

304
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,540
bit more sense as this will be justified

305
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,000
a little bit right the problem is is

306
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,730
that making a ledger longer is super

307
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,200
hard and is not easily controllable by

308
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,030
the person who's maintaining a ledger

309
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,750
righted there's some amount of luck

310
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,839
involved

311
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,910
now everyone probably with blockchains

312
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,010
has heard of like a proof of proof of

313
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,199
work some people have probably heard of

314
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,150
like proof of stake ultimately it comes

315
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,830
down to some York you have some sort of

316
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,390
commitment you're either so committed to

317
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,610
this that you're willing to waste tons

318
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,949
of electricity or you're so committed

319
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,920
that you have a bunch of money or stake

320
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,600
already in the ledger or whatever it is

321
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,250
not not just money that you're keeping

322
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,840
keeping track of okay so so a ledger is

323
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,170
like I said is a spreadsheet right so

324
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,210
you're you're adding you know rows or

325
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,560
transactions to the spreadsheet and

326
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,030
these don't actually have to be

327
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,280
financial transactions you can add

328
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,260
anything you want any arbitrary to data

329
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,689
to a ledger will work just fine this

330
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,780
ledger just happens to be Alice pays Bob

331
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:22,410
$100 or Alice pays Charlie $10 that sort

332
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:26,490
of thing so you segment your ledger into

333
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,569
blocks and so we have block 1 block 2

334
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,250
block 3 and then the

335
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,720
fourth block is provisional right there

336
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,210
there's additional transactions that

337
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,000
have happened beyond what the official

338
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,500
ledger any any individual user or any

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
individual person is keeping a ledger

340
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,670
there are certain transactions that have

341
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,890
happened beyond that and so that's a

342
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,189
part of a provisional block

343
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,750
so let's actually zoom in and understand

344
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,260
what is going on with these blocks so

345
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:56,460
you've seen blocks where's the chains so

346
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:58,290
here's the chains so what I've done is

347
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,980
I've zoomed in to you block one and

348
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:05,069
block two so so block one has a hash of

349
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,320
the block and then block two records

350
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,110
whatever the previous blocks hash was

351
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,550
and so those numbers are the same and

352
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:16,380
then block two has a hash of itself and

353
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,410
now into what the important part here is

354
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,500
is that the hash of block two contains

355
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,270
the hash of the previous block so the

356
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,480
other important part and this is sort of

357
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,660
really subtle is that you see that these

358
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,130
hashes they start with a bunch of zeros

359
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,260
so there's this property of a hash

360
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,939
function that you you you give it input

361
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,560
and you're completely surprised by the

362
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,910
output you have no idea what the output

363
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,459
is going to be until you compute the

364
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,600
hash so you can't go backwards and so if

365
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,250
you want to hash with a particular

366
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,250
property like it starts with a bunch of

367
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,860
zeros you really have no choice other

368
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,920
than just try inputs at random until you

369
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,740
get the sort of a desired output and so

370
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,199
in generating these hashes is really

371
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,990
really hard and if you only accept

372
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,300
blocks that have these is really hard to

373
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,420
generate hashes then you have this proof

374
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,160
of work you can if you can present this

375
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,079
to someone and say well look I have this

376
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,850
hash with this special property they can

377
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,710
go oh well you must have done a lot of

378
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,950
work in order to find that it's sort of

379
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,870
akin to if you give someone a haystack

380
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,640
and you have one needle in it and then

381
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,650
they come back to you later holding that

382
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,360
needle then you know that they did a lot

383
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,860
of work right you don't have to verify

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,180
that they went and searched the haystack

385
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,940
or you don't have to know anything about

386
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,709
how they did the needle searching work

387
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,660
they're simply presenting you the needle

388
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,040
that you hid in a haystack is enough to

389
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,089
know that they did a lot of work now

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,069
there's a chance that they could have

391
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,690
gotten lucky and just found the needle

392
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,750
instantly which there's also a chance

393
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,490
here on

394
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,630
average the amount of work that would be

395
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,190
needed is really infeasible and so I'll

396
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,170
talk a little bit more about this and

397
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:53,620
why that this produce is something that

398
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,780
is relatively secure so computing these

399
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,510
block cash ins is really really really

400
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,130
hard and this is when you hear about in

401
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,510
mining when you hear about mining

402
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,880
Bitcoin or mining whatever the

403
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,620
cryptocurrency is what people are

404
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,630
actually talking about is generating the

405
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,890
hashes to these blocks and computing

406
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,860
these hashes is quite challenging so

407
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,569
let's let's look back at what these sort

408
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,770
of design decisions of these design

409
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:22,540
choices gave us so each block has a hash

410
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:26,829
of the entire block

411
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,199
this makes blocks not changeable without

412
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:32,560
recomputing the hash right you can't go

413
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,590
and change Eve pays Charlie $100 - Eve

414
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,109
pays Charlie $200 for two reasons right

415
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,330
Eve did not sign that transaction so

416
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,370
that you couldn't change that but you

417
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,350
couldn't also add a transaction - Eve

418
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,839
has signed or or delete a transaction

419
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,400
without also recomputing the hash for

420
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,300
that block and since computing the

421
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,770
hashes for a block is very challenging

422
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,490
changing a block at all is a very large

423
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:59,230
amount of work and then also each block

424
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,990
contains the hash of the previous block

425
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,060
so they get chained together so that

426
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,010
means that you can't just insert a block

427
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,050
in the middle of things because that'll

428
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,609
sort of invalidate all future blocks all

429
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,560
future blocks that said that they

430
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,240
referenced some previous block if you if

431
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,198
you try to insert something there the

432
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,089
chain has been broken

433
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,400
or if you try to sort of fork off from

434
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:21,510
that point you're no longer the longest

435
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,100
you're no longer the longest ledger so

436
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,260
there's really two types of attacks to

437
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,409
think about here and we should talk

438
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,510
about why this sort of mechanism secures

439
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,260
both of these attacks so you can't

440
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,940
really change history so suppose you

441
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,490
have this chain of blocks block 1 block

442
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,760
2 block 3 block for block n along the

443
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,040
top and you want to go back in time and

444
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,260
you want to say remove a particular

445
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,730
transaction so so the reason you would

446
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,490
be motivated to do this with money for

447
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,470
example is suppose you bought a car in

448
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,320
block 2

449
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,250
and you spent $20,000 or whatever and

450
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,559
you transferred

451
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,679
you know 20,000 virtual dollars to

452
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,389
Toyota in block 2 and at a later date

453
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,240
you want to sort of reverse that

454
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,640
transaction and remove that you transfer

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,260
$20,000 from it you just get these

456
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,169
twenty thousand dollars back you know

457
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,879
sort of magically well blocks are always

458
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:18,780
being at the the chain is always being

459
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,360
added on to and the person with the

460
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,000
ledger the longest chain has the valid

461
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,149
one and so for you to get everyone in

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,799
the network to accept this new chain

463
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,789
that you're trying to forge where you've

464
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,830
changed walked - you have to change the

465
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,080
hash for walk to fix the hash for watch

466
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,629
sheet three fix the hash for block four

467
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,490
fix the hash for block n however long

468
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,950
this is and then you have to get one

469
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,760
more block onto it and the moment you

470
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,840
have n plus one blocks you can present

471
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,610
this change of the rest of the network

472
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,080
and they all accepted as the new valid

473
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,449
chain because it's now the longest one

474
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,070
and so this is how you could change

475
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:01,530
history the problem is is that the

476
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,770
amount of computational power needed to

477
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,740
generate the trendy hashes for these new

478
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,720
blocks is exceedingly high and the chain

479
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,760
is constantly growing right the whole

480
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,380
network is constantly using block three

481
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,510
then block floor then block n then n

482
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,780
plus 1 and plus 2 so you have to outrace

483
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,789
them in order to in order to to get the

484
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,200
longest chain not only you have to

485
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:24,330
compute a bunch of work up to the

486
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,770
present but you have as your as it takes

487
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,530
time for that you to do that you have to

488
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:31,918
sort of how race everyone else is

489
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,780
already working on the chain ok and you

490
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,030
can't really attack the future either so

491
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,620
you may want this is another type of

492
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,500
attack and it's very related to the

493
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,389
previous one which is you may want the

494
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,830
toyota dealership to think that you

495
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,600
transferred them twenty thousand dollars

496
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,490
and you don't want anyone else to think

497
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,959
that so that when you're talking to

498
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,700
other nodes in the networking you want

499
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,690
to spend money if they don't see that

500
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,950
you already spent twenty thousand

501
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,270
dollars so they think you have an extra

502
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,740
twenty thousand dollars they really do

503
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,440
but you want to convince the toy that

504
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,480
Toyota dealership that you transferred

505
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,559
them $20,000 so you have to sort of feed

506
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,990
them this fake blockchain

507
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,220
that has your transaction there and

508
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,370
they're the only ones that are seeing it

509
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,870
and in order for that to work is is that

510
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,219
the Toyota dealership is always looking

511
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,469
at everyone else's Ledger's to see who

512
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,090
has the longest one and so you have to

513
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,249
constantly be feeding them a ledger

514
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,399
longer than any other ledger that they

515
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:23,950
see so you know the current block is

516
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:26,168
sort of the light blue one and you want

517
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,110
to do sort of a fake private transaction

518
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:31,090
and just convince one party of that and

519
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,399
but the whole network is continuing to

520
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,428
use the public chain and so you're

521
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:39,070
constantly having to generate new

522
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:41,590
private blocks that it continues to be

523
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,539
longer than the public blocks so that

524
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,220
you can convince this one party that

525
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:46,629
they've received a transaction that they

526
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,269
haven't actually received according to

527
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:51,759
anyone else this is what people call a

528
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:55,149
51% attack so if you've ever heard of

529
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,669
like a 51% attack in Bitcoin or another

530
00:20:55,149 --> 00:21:00,369
cryptocurrency if you have more than

531
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:02,230
half of the computing power in the total

532
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:04,149
network then you can outrun everyone

533
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,179
else because you have 51% they only have

534
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:10,418
49% so you can keep the gig going for as

535
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,369
arbitrarily long and convinced you know

536
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,200
someone that the chain is one way

537
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:16,230
without convincing anyone else that the

538
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,669
chain is that way this is not

539
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,919
computationally feasible as long as you

540
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:24,279
can't gain more than 50% of the

541
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,049
computational power or in the cases of

542
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,909
chain block chains that don't use a

543
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,769
proof-of-work what use like a proof of

544
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:32,889
stake you need to somehow have more than

545
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:34,360
50% of the stake or there's some like

546
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,860
sometimes there's like a lottery system

547
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,269
and you have to somehow be able to game

548
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,899
the lottery so that you win at more than

549
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:44,860
50% of the time which is infeasible for

550
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:46,928
effectively every blockchain so a

551
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,449
blockchain has the the following

552
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:51,519
properties right so it's a database it's

553
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,570
immutable what I mean by immutable if

554
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,759
you're not familiar with that word is

555
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,178
that it's not changeable it's

556
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:00,340
distributed it's trustless its append

557
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:02,679
only so you can only add on to it you

558
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,199
can't change the past which is you know

559
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:08,710
very related to being immutable and it's

560
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,999
crypto a cryptographically secure these

561
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,379
are nice properties by the way this is

562
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:13,379
really these it's cool that there is

563
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:16,110
anything that produces these properties

564
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:18,090
so do we actually need block chains

565
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,549
well for a cryptocurrency it's very

566
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,169
clear that we do right if you look at

567
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,879
what the problems you have for money and

568
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,260
you and you want the requirement that

569
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,340
it's distributed and that there's no

570
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,750
government in control it's not

571
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,040
centralized that sort of thing

572
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,390
when you just make a list of those

573
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,860
requirements you end up with something

574
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,900
that looks very much like very much like

575
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,549
a blockchain so do you need a blockchain

576
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,870
for smart contracts I haven't even

577
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:38,490
talked about what a smart contract is

578
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,620
the answer is maybe

579
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,210
probably like it would make sense you

580
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,590
did you would implement smart contracts

581
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,630
with a blockchain do you need a

582
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,129
blockchain for other things well I have

583
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,620
we'll see and you'll see the answer's no

584
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,390
so further so so when do we need the

585
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,590
following properties right a database

586
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,880
immutable distributed trustless

587
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,799
append-only cryptographically secure

588
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,320
remember you need you need all of these

589
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,799
things simultaneously in order to need a

590
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,780
blockchain

591
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,879
so let's just look at them one at a time

592
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,559
so when you need a database loops all

593
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,940
the time because how are you going to

594
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,500
lose all your customers data if you're

595
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,030
not collecting it if you want to collect

596
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,510
it you need a database right when do you

597
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:20,280
need immutability pretty rarely actually

598
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,600
usually a full history suffices and you

599
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,370
don't usually need like cryptographic

600
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,409
guaranteed that things can't be changed

601
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,989
so this is examples like the Wikipedia

602
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,340
edit history you know who cares that

603
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,679
there's no cryptographic proof that

604
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,590
there hasn't been any change not listed

605
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,299
in the end of history it's good enough

606
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,309
this is also true like with audit logs

607
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,450
you can just ship off copies of the

608
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:41,700
audit logs to some other location

609
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,620
without having a cryptographic proof of

610
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,020
the immunity of something being

611
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,590
immutable um so it's actually pretty

612
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,450
rare that you truly need immune ability

613
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,010
when do you need distributed data well

614
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,330
the actor is is sometimes right so

615
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,040
there's lots of reasons to distribute

616
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,020
data you can distribute it because of a

617
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,070
fault tolerance or redundancy but you

618
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,320
can also distribute it for for

619
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,049
performance reasons this would be like

620
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,850
MapReduce like architectures where you

621
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:07,470
need to copy the data to a bunch of

622
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,209
nodes so they can all sort of process on

623
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,250
the data locally and sort of send the

624
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,010
results up in a MapReduce architecture

625
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:16,380
so distribution of data is is not

626
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,049
unreasonable but fault tolerance is sort

627
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,610
of I think the main reason so when you

628
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,230
need something that's decentralized and

629
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,689
totally trust lists the answer is

630
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,490
basically never virtually never and now

631
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm excluding the case for crypto

632
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,280
currencies here because you definitely

633
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,110
need this for crypto currency

634
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,370
but when do you need those what when

635
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,330
you're scamming people but that's a

636
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,800
different story so when are we ever in

637
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,210
the situation where we can't designate

638
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,409
some sort of central trusted Authority

639
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,060
it's really rare especially since

640
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,940
virtually all of us work for companies

641
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,530
and when you work for a company it's

642
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,030
it's there's a certain amount of trust

643
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,010
built into the company that you guys are

644
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,930
running usually something like an Active

645
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,850
Directory or some sort of a centralized

646
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,040
authentication database you're running

647
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,990
you know something like Kerberos we have

648
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,670
a trusted third party already like the

649
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,770
technology is already built and

650
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,200
companies are already built on the whole

651
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,830
idea of a centralized authority it's

652
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,750
quite quite unusual outside of sort of

653
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,790
the libertarian an anarcho-capitalist ik

654
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,500
fantasy that you don't need that you

655
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,990
actually need something that's

656
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,180
completely decentralized and trustless

657
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:24,450
and so when do you need append-only and

658
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,130
the answer is not very often usually

659
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,500
things are done append-only

660
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,960
because the underlying technology is

661
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,790
faster because of that or because the

662
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,800
underlying technology is simpler because

663
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,720
of that so things that were I think

664
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,240
things in the past that were append-only

665
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,490
were like burning a CD right you you

666
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,620
can't go back and unburn parts of it

667
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,280
unless you had like an RW but never mind

668
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,320
how that works or sometimes like flash

669
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,520
media is much higher performance when

670
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,760
it's append-only where you have like

671
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,139
sort of a round robin ring but if this

672
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,940
is usually just done for performance

673
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,980
it's rare that you truly need app end up

674
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,500
only as an underlying property of the

675
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,090
system that you're designing and then

676
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,770
when do we need cryptographically secure

677
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,580
assurance and the answer is actually way

678
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,500
more than we think

679
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,429
as an industry we don't do a very good

680
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,230
job of this things are oftentimes a lot

681
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,880
better and in certain classes of attacks

682
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,070
completely go away when we have

683
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,110
cryptographic assurance built in when we

684
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,840
have digital signatures of everything

685
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,899
when we have sort of check sums and and

686
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,459
and hash like checkpoints which in in a

687
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,830
blockchain way is a block right we have

688
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,200
a checkpoint of every block you there's

689
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,810
this offers a lot more auditability it

690
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,100
offers a lot more detection of fault of

691
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,840
detection of tampering that sort of

692
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,719
thing so we actually I think need this a

693
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,870
lot more than we realize

694
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,630
so if not block chains

695
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:47,070
then if what if we could just relax some

696
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,990
of these requirements because remember

697
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,780
to have up to need a blockchain

698
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,250
you need all of these you need to

699
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,230
simultaneously have all of these

700
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,160
properties and it's very unusual to have

701
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,090
a system like that

702
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:03,600
so if we could just relax even one of

703
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:07,050
those requirements then why is git not

704
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,719
in a solution here right git is

705
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:13,950
effectively impend only effectively

706
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,110
immutable effectively has you know audit

707
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,550
log units got cryptographic assurance

708
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,439
it's a database where you can store

709
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,180
arbitrary data in it you know get is

710
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,730
already a tool that does almost

711
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,500
everything that we need when we relax

712
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,500
those requirements even a tiny bit now

713
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,750
yes git does have some ability to edit

714
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,630
history and but no one really knows how

715
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:38,010
to do that anyways because so it's

716
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,690
effectively immutable so if not get and

717
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,440
gets not gets not actually the right

718
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:45,330
answer git is the easy is the right

719
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,640
answer for a small number of solutions

720
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,490
but there are better answers for for

721
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,800
most other situations that people try to

722
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,020
apply blockchains to so what about just

723
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,940
a database if you can designate a

724
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,910
trusted central authority then a

725
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,130
database suffice is just fine do you

726
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,390
need some level of privacy that sort of

727
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,760
thing what about an encrypted database

728
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,260
well what about where you you the

729
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,090
clients who are sending data to you

730
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,620
first encrypt it and then send it to you

731
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,679
and you store effectively a binary block

732
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,469
I mean that's how LastPass works and who

733
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,570
everyone either uses LastPass keepass or

734
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,030
some other password manager most people

735
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,530
who do anyways you're not sending your

736
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,020
pastors to LastPass how does that work

737
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,430
right they encrypted the database you

738
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,200
send them a binary blob they don't have

739
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,590
the key for it they store it for you you

740
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,940
didn't need a blockchain for that what

741
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,740
about a distributed file system

742
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,200
sometimes like that what you really need

743
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,400
when you need distributed data is just

744
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,420
the distributed file system and there's

745
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,350
a lot of different distributed file

746
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,210
systems with a lot of different

747
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,610
interesting properties what about an

748
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,890
append-only log file what if you need

749
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:49,199
audited ability right so you produce

750
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,520
logs you ship them off to a different

751
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
location where they can't really be

752
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,940
changed the logs have now been separated

753
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,600
from the system that the logs are about

754
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,100
so

755
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,350
if the system gets compromised the logs

756
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,120
are not compromised what about digital

757
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,860
signatures right that a lot of the

758
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,379
problems that that can be solved that

759
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,959
people advocate a blockchain for solving

760
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,179
or actually trivially solvable just with

761
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,160
digital signatures or how about a

762
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,960
peer-to-peer network right blockchains

763
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,520
use a peer-to-peer network oftentimes

764
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,720
the peer-to-peer network is the property

765
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,820
of the blockchain that actually solves

766
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,470
the problem not all the other stuff what

767
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,939
about a trusted broker right so to

768
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,380
people that don't trust each other if

769
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,900
they can agree on a trusted intermediary

770
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,429
then they can broker transactions

771
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,230
between between the two people you don't

772
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,880
need a blockchain for it um and

773
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,210
sometimes honestly a spreadsheets of

774
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,710
Isis so in many situations where where

775
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,190
someone says we need a blockchain what

776
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,600
they really need is a spreadsheet so

777
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,419
block chains are built for a world that

778
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,719
looks like this

779
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:48,809
InfoSec is actually this world so we're

780
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,070
in the castle and the s the castles on

781
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,710
fire

782
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:56,399
and yes we are way outnumbered by the

783
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,380
mob outside but at least it's not this

784
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,450
we have some chance of defending

785
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,640
ourselves and building relatively simple

786
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,320
systems this is typically the situation

787
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,120
that we're actually in you know and that

788
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,889
castle might be called Cisco Systems or

789
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,830
IBM or whatever the company that we work

790
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,059
for but we can at least trust each other

791
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:15,809
a little bit we at least have some

792
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:17,668
semblance of a trusted authority we at

793
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,620
least have some semblance of borders and

794
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:20,760
we understand whose data were trying to

795
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,590
keep and who's rated we're trying to

796
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,940
protect and who the people are on the

797
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,980
outside attacking us that sort of thing

798
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,059
so this is the little world that we live

799
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,830
in and this is the role that we need to

800
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,600
be thinking about and blockchains don't

801
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:35,309
solve this problem they solved this

802
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,168
problem so for more information like I

803
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:39,030
said I not a single idea that I had for

804
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,409
this talk was original and I didn't know

805
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,690
that until I started doing research for

806
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:44,400
the talk and there's really two good

807
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,870
really good resources one of them is

808
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,909
this book attack of the 50-foot

809
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,889
blockchain this book is hilarious and it

810
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:51,659
mostly attacks cryptocurrencies but

811
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,090
there's a lot of sort of good core ideas

812
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:56,820
about blockchain and then there's a

813
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,168
video on how block chains work and if

814
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,120
you want to understand more of the

815
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:02,039
technical detail more about the proof of

816
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,399
work more about the types of attacks

817
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:07,650
this video is absolutely fantastic it's

818
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,519
incredibly easy to understand this the

819
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,950
guy who makes this

820
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,499
is a freaking genius so these two

821
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:16,469
resources are absolutely great resources

822
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:19,289
if you're interested in this area and I

823
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:23,659
say questions but I don't really have a

824
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:23,658
lot of time for that so maybe one or two

825
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:38,119
you sir in the back okay

826
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,850
okay so it's so the question was suppose

827
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,220
your organization and someone proposes a

828
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:59,520
blockchain to to solve a problem the

829
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,380
example was land title's and so the idea

830
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,430
behind land title's here is right you

831
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,200
know there's some hunt has some

832
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,520
ownership of land and and trying to

833
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,140
figure out you know proving that you own

834
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,400
that land and you know finding off

835
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,790
claims that other people on that land

836
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,950
how do you when the one someone comes to

837
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,290
you with the problem land titles and the

838
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,270
solution blockchain how do you sort of

839
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,010
quickly socialize the idea that

840
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,220
blockchain is not necessarily the right

841
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,470
solution to this so that's actually a

842
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,030
really interesting question and if we go

843
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,320
all the way back to the very beginning

844
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:33,090
of my presentation this graph of

845
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,679
blockchain if you look at the first the

846
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,080
ten number one country in this Google

847
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:41,520
Trends graph the number one country is

848
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:44,010
Ghana and you might wonder well why why

849
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,610
is the number one country Ghana and the

850
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:51,360
reason is is that in Ghana they have a

851
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:54,449
significant problem with land tidal

852
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,229
issues land tidal disputes they have a

853
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,090
bunch of subsistence farmers who have

854
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,650
you know who feel like they own the land

855
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,060
maybe they do own the land but they

856
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,800
don't really have any documentation or

857
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,870
proof that they own the land and Gaughan

858
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,100
has proposed a solution to this is what

859
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,580
we'll do is we'll make a land title

860
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,830
registration blockchain and then

861
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,210
everyone will will be able to prove in

862
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,199
court that they own land and you know

863
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,250
we'll be able to settle these disputes

864
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,580
that sort of thing

865
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,860
um and it's obviously completely

866
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,449
ridiculous so so first thing I think to

867
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,729
to countering any sort of problem like

868
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,250
this is understanding the problem so

869
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,900
what is the problem in Ghana or any

870
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,790
other place with land title's or what is

871
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,310
the problem with whatever people

872
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,020
proposed the the blockchain is going to

873
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,000
solve and if you understand that problem

874
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,740
and you understand where the hard parts

875
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,050
in that problem you oftentimes realize

876
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,000
that the hard parts are not actually

877
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:47,370
what the blockchain is addressing so in

878
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,710
Ghana the hard parts are they have to

879
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,439
physically go out and survey land and

880
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,450
figure out GPS coordinates and talk to

881
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,670
talk to landowners and talk to the

882
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,840
neighbors and talk and ask how long is

883
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,550
your family lived here and that sort of

884
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,899
thing that's the hard part

885
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,820
right once they

886
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,160
the hard work they could issue a

887
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,500
certificate with a digital signature in

888
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,490
a QR code that would validate that the

889
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,860
government has issued you the

890
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:12,600
certificate saying that you own this you

891
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,679
know this section of land here's the GPS

892
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,029
coordinates and then the next time

893
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,460
there's a land dispute they can take

894
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,810
that certificate to court and if the

895
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,580
judge doesn't believe them they can scan

896
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,110
the qr-code and we could we could do

897
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,790
this with QR codes and apps and not a

898
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,980
blockchain or we could do this with a

899
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,610
database of land ownership right this so

900
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,530
so the hard part is is in the surveying

901
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,990
and all of the all would work on the

902
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,700
ground of talking to people and really

903
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,049
writing it all down writing all down

904
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,000
once and for all but once it's written

905
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,870
down you don't need to store that in a

906
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,610
blockchain what does the blockchain

907
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,168
solve a part of this problem you can

908
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,720
store that in database you can store

909
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,600
that in paper on a certificate you can

910
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,100
store that a bunch of different ways

911
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,350
blockchain is not necessarily a great

912
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,020
way to store it so there's one potential

913
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:56,850
property that a blockchain has that

914
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,890
could be useful here which is that it's

915
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:02,310
an open and public database that anyone

916
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:04,319
can query right so so someone will not

917
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,420
even bother to try to steal some of your

918
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,010
land if they can already go and check

919
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,450
the database and see that you have the

920
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,680
certificate that proves that you own it

921
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,629
because then they'll know that there's

922
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,850
there their claim their fraudulent claim

923
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,220
is gonna be thrown out right away so an

924
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,660
open database that anyone can query or

925
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,000
database that multiple people have

926
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,649
copies of or that anyone can get a copy

927
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,570
of when they write the state or that

928
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,220
anyone has given a copy of when their

929
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:29,160
land gets surveyed solves this problem

930
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,600
the blockchain is an unnecessary tool

931
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,089
for solving this problem and that's

932
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,640
usually the case that when you really

933
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,230
understand what the underlying problems

934
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,700
are you understand where you need to

935
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,340
focus your resources and you realize

936
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,080
that the blockchain solution

937
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,090
quote/unquote solution does not actually

938
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,029
help you with those and so I'm out of

939
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:49,440
time but there's one well okay so I'm

940
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,740
not actually quite out of time Mac is

941
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,500
Mac is telling me I can keep talking

942
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,700
this example of the poor folks in Ghana

943
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,320
having to Google what the hell a

944
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,740
blockchain is because their land has to

945
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,180
be registered to one is both a blessing

946
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,459
and a curse

947
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,250
so blockchains what are they good for is

948
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,200
not a slide that I have but if I were to

949
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,710
have it getting people to think about

950
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,430
these hard problems is a good good sort

951
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,740
of

952
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,819
positive benefit of blockchains people

953
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,439
think that a blockchain is gonna solve

954
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:21,180
this hard problem and they get really

955
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
energized and motivated to go solve that

956
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,319
problem and then they start working on

957
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,400
the hard problem of going and surveying

958
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:28,170
the land and talking to the neighbors

959
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,700
and that sort of thing and never mind

960
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,559
that they're doing it for sort of weird

961
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,169
blockchain reasons they're actually

962
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,819
solving a real problem even if the way

963
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,000
that they're ultimately registering it

964
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,900
is kind of dumb so I think I have time

965
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,920
for one more question

966
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,630
I don't have another question so folks

967
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:54,340
thank you very much for your time

968
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:54,340
[Applause]
