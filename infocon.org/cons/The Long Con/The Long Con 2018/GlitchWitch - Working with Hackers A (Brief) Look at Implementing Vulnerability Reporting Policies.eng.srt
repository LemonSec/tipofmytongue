1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,720
hi everyone thanks for coming to my talk

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,280
working with hackers a brief look at

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,369
implementing vulnerability of Scotia

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,230
policies and bug bounties before we get

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,080
started just a quick note please don't

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,550
take any photos or videos you can get

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,089
access to my slides though on my website

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,790
if you need to copy of any of those okay

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,770
so who am i glitch which obviously not

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,019
my real name but a handle that I use to

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,940
kind of preserve my privacy I currently

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,489
work as a freelance information security

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,110
researcher primarily doing penetration

14
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,750
testing managing bug bounties and

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,510
providing consulting services you can

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,310
learn more about that my website as well

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,140
over the past decade I've working on

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:59,640
wide sorry quite nervous I've worked in

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,040
a wide range of roles in a number of

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,990
industries and in my own my spare time I

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,270
do my own auto repairs and quite enjoy

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,229
that yeah fun fact this is my first time

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:15,298
presenting at a conference

24
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:16,740
so quite anxious but thank you right so

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,929
today we're talking about funny relieves

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,490
closure policies but at the end of this

27
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:22,009
talk you should hopefully have a basic

28
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,899
understanding of at least a few things

29
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,030
including why you should have a Wan

30
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:30,719
abilities closure policy some BEC best

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,719
practices sorry some best practices to

32
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,270
follow when implementing a policy some

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,788
resources help you get started and also

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,810
briefly touch on the differences between

35
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,880
bug bounties and vulnerability

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,100
disclosure policies some benefits of

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,089
running a bug bounty and how to prepare

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,439
for launching a bug bounty so what is

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,490
the vulnerability disclosure policy

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,600
often shirt in hand for PDP a

41
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,729
vulnerability is closure policy is

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,469
intended to give hackers and researchers

43
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,420
clear guidelines for submitting

44
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,079
potentially unknown and harmful security

45
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,490
vulnerabilities to your organization so

46
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,079
good vulnerability disclosure policy

47
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,090
will provide a clear path for external

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,269
parties such as hackers and researchers

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,650
toward issues to you and doing so will

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,440
give clear guidelines for things such as

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,280
what your scope is things that they can

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,290
be testing and things they should avoid

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,020
a good VDP you also ensure legal safe

54
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,480
harbor for both the program runners and

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,030
searchers and ultimately a successful

56
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,130
UDP will prove the overall security

57
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,130
posture of your product or organization

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,690
so why do you need a vulnerability of

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,850
scotia policy if you have a publicly

60
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,260
facing website or product you probably

61
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,780
should have a disclosure policy for a

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,459
number of reasons first off as we all

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,860
know nothing's hundred percent secure

64
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,160
people will find bugs whether you want

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,490
them to you or not when those bugs are

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,660
found

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,410
I think of owner ability of Scotia

68
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,049
policy you freud's a clear path on how

69
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,579
to handle them which also mainly lead to

70
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,290
those bugs getting fixed clicker and

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,850
then that way if people like me don't

72
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,739
have to go through LinkedIn and find the

73
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:12,960
security officer and contact them

74
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:15,060
directly VDP will some Kerch hackers to

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,610
tell you about bugs rather than just

76
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,900
ignoring them droplet zero days sell

77
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,020
them or even exploit them for their own

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,970
gain and of course a VDP will help quell

79
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,400
fear fear some researchers like myself

80
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,150
who face legal threats and might be

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,740
operating in sort of a gray area this is

82
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,700
kind of a big one because often times

83
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,459
without a vulnerability disclosure

84
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,519
policy researchers can be operating

85
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,900
outside of the law or in violation of

86
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,610
laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse

87
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,620
Act where they might not actually have

88
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:49,140
authorization to do that but they're

89
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,880
trying to be helpful now a good

90
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,000
vulnerability of a Scotia policy should

91
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,720
include some key elements first you

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,200
should have guidelines from

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,340
communication such as we report bugs and

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,049
this could be a contact form

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,630
or often it's security at your company

96
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,390
LD and if possible you should include a

97
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,810
PGP or some other way to encrypt that

98
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,279
data and get it to you securely you

99
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,090
should also include the expected

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,709
response time

101
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,840
ideally you'd want to communicate with

102
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,358
researchers as soon as they email you

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,519
typically within 48 hours ideally and

104
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,570
then set yourself a deadline for when

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,430
they should check back in if they

106
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:29,010
haven't heard anything you should also

107
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,240
include expectations around what sort of

108
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,849
information they should include in the

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,500
report this might for example ask them

110
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,950
to include a proof of concept or an

111
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,490
applicable CVE number an acknowledgement

112
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,909
this look

113
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,020
lay out how you'll reward researchers

114
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,520
oftentimes just having a bullet point on

115
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,840
your website saying this person found

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
this vulnerability is more than enough

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,940
and really helps researchers build

118
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,940
resumes

119
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,020
everything's broken

120
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,770
certainly that

121
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:47,889
right so a good vulnerability disclosure

122
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:52,179
policy she includes some key elements

123
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:54,349
first there should be no this is already

124
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:55,969
sorry about that

125
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,558
now that we kind of understand why we

126
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,689
need a phoner ability of score policy

127
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:01,039
and what you should include in your

128
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,949
policy we can take a look at some of the

129
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,139
resources help get you started the first

130
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,909
one is the open source vulnerability

131
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,709
disclosure framework by bugcrowd cipher

132
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,199
law I was designed to help prepare

133
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:15,259
organizations to work with independently

134
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,089
with security researchers I'd offer a

135
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,289
sort of a scent of boilerplate templates

136
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,699
that you can quickly write out and

137
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,099
publish to get your own policy going

138
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,099
this is one that I've seen used in a lot

139
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:27,199
of places the second one is disclosed at

140
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,909
i/o which kind of works um kind of

141
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,349
builds off of the previous work and

142
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,438
again it attempts to standardize this

143
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:36,529
practices around safe harbor and good

144
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:40,069
fate for security researchers there's

145
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,959
also a free ISO kind of gives guidelines

146
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,479
for disclosures the vulnerabilities so

147
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,499
if 42 pages goes into great detail

148
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,829
pretty much all the things you might

149
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:49,969
wonder of course you can always look at

150
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,729
other companies vulnerability disclosure

151
00:06:49,969 --> 00:07:00,589
policies some examples included are

152
00:06:52,729 --> 00:07:02,179
Google's cloud players drop boxes now

153
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,649
that we understand what you need to

154
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:06,049
successfully implement vulnerability

155
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:08,749
disclosure policy we can take a look at

156
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,539
some common pitfalls to avoid the first

157
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:13,189
set is around communication things like

158
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,039
not having timely response can be

159
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,050
detrimental to your program again

160
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,378
typically you want to have an initial

161
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,029
response within a day or two and again

162
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:27,349
kind of give a timeline for that further

163
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:29,179
communication there's been cases where

164
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,369
I've seen where you know not responding

165
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:33,859
initially in the first 24-48 hours can

166
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:35,869
actually anger some researchers that are

167
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,159
maybe more gray hat well those just drop

168
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:41,149
the vulnerability as a zero-day right

169
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:43,279
there and then I also want to have a

170
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,729
clear communication internal

171
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,229
communication and documentation path

172
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,729
this will include making sure all the

173
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,300
applicable teams are on kind of the same

174
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,919
page

175
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,379
and that you're properly triaging

176
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,150
findings and documenting when you don't

177
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,310
in cases where you make businesses to

178
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,989
not fix an issue right away it's very

179
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,090
important to document why that happened

180
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,919
to avoid any potential legal or

181
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:11,679
regulatory issues this kind of ties in

182
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,120
with resources and staffing ideally the

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,129
team receiving the reports will have

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,569
strong customer service skills they're

185
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:26,259
really building relationships with the

186
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:27,279
community and sometimes also like the

187
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,860
people who are on the other end of the

188
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,458
screen make a living off of this so have

189
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,870
some empathy another common pitfall is

190
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,689
the inability for your team to actually

191
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,010
validate hire ties the findings again

192
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:47,980
having the right people taking in these

193
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:49,779
reports can be very very important of

194
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,269
course there's an ability to fix the

195
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,649
bugs that are reported to you um this

196
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,089
can have several consequences not just

197
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,769
for the obvious reasons of having

198
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,990
untouched runner abilities but also

199
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,240
legal problems too for example if a

200
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,100
cyber incident occurs at least two

201
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,560
regulatory investigation or a lawsuit

202
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,480
and they see that you have a whole bunch

203
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,589
of unpatched vulnerabilities that could

204
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,690
look like you're not taking security

205
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:16,269
very seriously now you might be

206
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,769
wondering what about bunnies bunnies

207
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,110
typically differ from vulnerability of

208
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,279
sculture policies in a few ways but

209
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,529
gonna knees expand on your existing

210
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,060
vulnerability of sculture policy by

211
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,649
offering incentives and financial

212
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:31,420
rewards researchers who discover

213
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,890
vulnerabilities within your products but

214
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,250
grow knees are typically set up within

215
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:40,060
your organization when your organization

216
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,860
already has a good security posture and

217
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,510
of course bug bounties aren't for

218
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,589
everyone just because all the cool

219
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,459
because they're doing it doesn't mean

220
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,459
you need to implement one

221
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,310
now before you get started on launching

222
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,500
a successful by Benny program you know

223
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,939
what I have a few things first you want

224
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,040
to have an existing stick burner ability

225
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,870
to disclosure policy I was thrown grasp

226
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,040
on handling researchers researcher

227
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,080
submissions a deal you'll have had this

228
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,430
in place for some time and will worked

229
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,220
out the kinks and properly handling

230
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,569
submissions and getting them fixed you

231
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,370
also want to have a healthy budget for

232
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,070
rewarding researchers and for paying

233
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,230
yourself having an existing disclosure

234
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,880
policy can actually help you kind of

235
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,890
estimate what that budget will be and of

236
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,080
course you want good security posture as

237
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,240
you hopefully know a bug bounty is not a

238
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,890
pen test so ideally oh what I've done

239
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,140
pen testing and security testing

240
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,550
beforehand

241
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:45,480
doing that will actually save you a lot

242
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:47,010
of money when you go watch the know

243
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,380
before you launch a bug bounty you also

244
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,360
want to consider a few things for self

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,120
rewards how much will you reward

246
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,040
researchers will you offer cash or swag

247
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,320
such as conference ikut soar software

248
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,990
licenses if you're paying cash rewards

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,790
how much are you willing to pay what are

250
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,020
the bugs that are most that are most

251
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,699
valuable to you typically one rule of

252
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,260
thumb to follow is if you've made a code

253
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,970
change you should be paying the others

254
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,360
platform where you gonna host your bad

255
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,370
bunny

256
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,900
we're gonna host it yourself we owe some

257
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,930
a platform like hacker wanna bug crowd

258
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:26,730
and we'll be public or invite-only now

259
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,439
if you are gonna go with a platform

260
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,760
there's some pros and cons obviously

261
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,010
there's more than this but these are a

262
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,260
few pros if you don't have a large

263
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,970
financial team often researchers are

264
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,710
working in all kinds of countries and

265
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,600
you're not to deal with tax paperwork

266
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,290
with them so if you go with the platform

267
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,470
often that's handled for you manage bug

268
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,290
bounties off it also reduce the internal

269
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,000
workload so having someone else kind of

270
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,270
verify and triage that for you what kind

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,980
of save you a lot of time internally and

272
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,199
using a platform also gets you instant

273
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,310
recognition and exposure and kind of an

274
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,920
immediate response in the hacker

275
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,630
community and of course there's some

276
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,760
cons it might end up being more

277
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,590
expensive

278
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,360
most platforms charge at minimum about

279
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:13,040
20% of the payouts you offer there's a

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,870
third water irresponsibility so it might

281
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,880
not be in your risk appetite to have all

282
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,730
of your vulnerability reports on an

283
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,290
external platform and often you'll get

284
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,150
lots of submissions not always high

285
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:29,390
quality ones swell and so you might not

286
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:30,920
be able to handle that immediately in

287
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,880
conclusion vulnerability disclosure

288
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,589
policies help overall security they also

289
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,650
encourage researchers to report findings

290
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,390
they might not have they take a lot of

291
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,110
work to implement but they're definitely

292
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,670
worth it

293
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:50,390
and bounteous learned for everyone and

294
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,890
communication is key and that's it I'm

295
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,630
done a little bit early but coffee

296
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,490
breaks next if you want to submit

297
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,080
questions you can split them there or

298
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,080
you can come up and ask to you

299
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,500
specifically the government you said

300
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,030
yeah yeah so the question was how is the

301
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,710
government kind of relating until this

302
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,220
and are they getting better

303
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,530
in my experience mostly but bounties

304
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,850
that I have done him submitted to have

305
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,579
been from the US government and there

306
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,650
actually is a lot of push both from the

307
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,540
FTC and another organization that have

308
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,949
actually been pushing for more people to

309
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,230
have honorable Dias culture policies

310
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,700
because they recognize the benefit so

311
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,800
definitely there over the last say five

312
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,030
years or so there's been a lot more

313
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,199
adoption and there's been a lot more

314
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:49,390
push to really see that happen yeah I

315
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,010
mean I again I haven't really I don't

316
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,880
know the politics of Canadian government

317
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,880
in regards this but

318
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:07,169
[Applause]
