1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,120
so hello everyone my name is Mike yelets

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,340
I'm a Solutions Architect for Paul -

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,379
networks I'm coming out here to talk a

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,500
little bit about our view of the

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,259
Canadian threat landscape so first slide

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,850
legal 9 realize this is going online so

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,990
I gotta be very specific on what I talk

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,930
about and I kind of wish I wouldn't put

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,060
this slide in here now but legal team

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,770
came down on me pretty hard they wanted

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,629
to make sure that everyone realizes here

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,180
that first off I am NOT a threat

13
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:38,910
researcher ok by trade this is not my

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,649
job we have teams that do that what I've

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,929
done though is I've taken all the data

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,450
that we see from Palo Alto Networks and

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,730
really kind of sliced and diced it on a

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,559
Canadian threat landscape so really

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,540
looking at the campaign's that we see in

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,239
Canada the actors that are hitting

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,790
Canada you know and we're gonna talk a

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,239
little bit about how Canada differs from

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,530
the world we have very specific threats

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,690
that we see we have very specific

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,460
transport mechanisms that we see in

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,410
Canada so we're gonna go through some of

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,679
that again some of this is

28
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,750
interpretation on myself because again

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,750
I'm not a threat researcher so in one of

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,000
the examples I'm gonna show there was

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,429
7,200 samples I did not go through all

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,800
of them that is a long a lot of effort a

33
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:24,509
long time so what I did in that case was

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,209
I grouped them together anything that

35
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,319
looks similar I treat it as one sample

36
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:34,289
okay also this information comes from

37
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,539
the the global threat Alliance and

38
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:38,880
specifically our wildfire service that

39
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:41,399
Palo ttle Network has so we don't see

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,750
everything that happens in Canada right

41
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,880
that is that is not what we're looking

42
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,459
at what we're looking at here is a

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,220
combination of about 5 million endpoints

44
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,590
and a hundred and twenty-five thousand

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,289
firewall devices that are all kind of

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,920
combining data for worldwide

47
00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:01,530
you know worldwide visibility into what

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,479
we're seeing so what I've done here is

49
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,940
specifically looked at data from January

50
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,310
1st of this year up until September 30th

51
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,199
now I did this presentation a couple of

52
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,480
weeks ago that's why the the timeframe

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,619
is basically a month old also it took me

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,849
a couple weeks to get through all this

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,689
stuff so I didn't want to try to do

56
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,220
November 1st

57
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,440
and come out here because I wouldn't be

58
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,510
very up-to-date I was pretty surprised

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,770
Theo had had done the research on a

60
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,380
paper that came out a week and a half

61
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,610
ago that's pretty ballsy to get up here

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,579
and do a presentation on something

63
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,920
that's that new so so again like I said

64
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,500
the most the data in this presentation

65
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,149
our source was from the wildfire fire

66
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,040
service that Paul - Annette works offers

67
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,690
as well as virustotal

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,910
so we've actually correlated some of the

69
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,060
data with virustotal to go a little bit

70
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:50,709
deeper into sorry she's just taking

71
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,209
pictures so go a little bit deeper into

72
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,550
some of the you know especially the

73
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,440
threats and the campaigns that we were

74
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,690
seeing because not all the information

75
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,650
that was was provided from our unit 42

76
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,570
group was you know was very in-depth

77
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,480
also we're looking at first scene okay

78
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,019
so this is a very very specific way of

79
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,929
looking at data so we might have seen a

80
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,860
new exploit a new file a new type of

81
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,660
malware hit once okay once we've seen it

82
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,269
that's a check box for us we don't

83
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,180
bother continuing to look for it okay

84
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,890
because we've seen it you know the

85
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,140
industry is already protected against it

86
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,690
so there are cases here where we've seen

87
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,190
a file hit once I've treated that as a

88
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,989
checkbox but it might have been a

89
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,030
million times over the next three weeks

90
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:41,440
so when we're specifically looking at

91
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,690
targeted attacks the next 999,000 to us

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,640
aren't really that important the first

93
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,170
instance is important because that's

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,000
usually what's been targeted at a

95
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,160
certain organization so once you

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,540
understand that when we start talking

97
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,769
about some of the numbers that's why

98
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,510
some of the numbers seem a little bit

99
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,560
smaller than what you'd be expect and

100
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,209
when we start talking about worldwide

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,750
numbers you know we're talking about you

102
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,850
know millions or hundreds of millions of

103
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,640
instances we've actually seen billions

104
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,670
of these files happening but those are

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,268
first seen first instance first response

106
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,530
type of of instances and again the

107
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,380
information here was specifically

108
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,450
provided to us from our internal threat

109
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,640
group called unit 42 and again some of

110
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,310
this information has been interpreted on

111
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,260
my part so again that satisfies all my

112
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,430
legal stuff that I needed to cover so as

113
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,669
long as everyone gives me a thumbs-up

114
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,540
gate we're good good to go so when I

115
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,729
started with Paulding

116
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,310
works about a year ago my first question

117
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,260
I had to myself really was is Canada a

118
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,810
target for like advanced persistent

119
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,640
threats and nation states because we see

120
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,780
all the stuff in the news we hear all

121
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,030
about this stuff especially in the

122
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,159
Middle East where governments are

123
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,330
attacking governments u.s. is doing some

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,910
stuff maybe they should or shouldn't be

125
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,190
doing but really is this affecting

126
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,590
Canada or are we just kind of collateral

127
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,180
damage to all the other stuff that's

128
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,799
going on the world so that was the

129
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,780
question I started trying to answer

130
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,280
myself and again I've been working on

131
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,340
this for a couple of months now I've

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,799
broken this down into very specific

133
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,479
areas again specific threat actors that

134
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,520
we know about and what they're you know

135
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,100
their activity within Canada has been as

136
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,169
well as specific campaigns that we've

137
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,030
seen happen over the past year again

138
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,030
nine months from January first into

139
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,320
September so before that I want to kind

140
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,440
of get into what the threat landscape

141
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,260
looks like worldwide versus Canada so

142
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,150
again first sample our first new malware

143
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,240
samples seen worldwide in that timeframe

144
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:38,289
was just over 130 million we are seeing

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,540
a lot of malware surprisingly last month

146
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,590
and again so this is data that's you

147
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,100
know again not within this presentation

148
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,729
but starting in October we saw a massive

149
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,820
spike in Android like probably a hundred

150
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,310
times increase in and Android related

151
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,680
malware than we've ever seen before

152
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,080
not quite sure why that happened all of

153
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,450
a sudden but the Android actors out

154
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,039
there have gotten very very active

155
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,960
so when we start talking about kind of

156
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,150
the the top file types that we see in

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,070
the top campaigns we're seeing a

158
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,590
definite shift in the past kind of four

159
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,750
to five weeks to more of more mobile

160
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,190
devices away from what we've seen in the

161
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,720
past and that's very you know very

162
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,310
surprising to a lot of people in the

163
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,380
industry within Canada we saw again

164
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,300
135,000 new malware of samples so this

165
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,210
isn't you know this isn't a small number

166
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,550
this is a lot of malware coming across

167
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,799
Canada and it is something that you know

168
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,330
our organizations are you know and this

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,100
is wrapping up so organizations are

170
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,560
seeing higher and higher numbers of

171
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,930
malware coming towards them you know

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,550
daily so can we see this this slide

173
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,680
doesn't always translate very well

174
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,860
um so this is basically just a breakdown

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,470
on what we see worldwide versus within

176
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,230
Canada so top application worldwide is

177
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,330
web browsing by far right so we see most

178
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,390
malware being transferred through some

179
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,609
type of web click go to a site download

180
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,890
this you know we've all hit that you

181
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,940
know if you're an IT your users have

182
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,010
done that and that's you know that's

183
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,960
usually the biggest pain that we see

184
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,550
what we're starting to see a little bit

185
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,890
more of is if you kind of go all the way

186
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,760
down to the the second last one on the

187
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:20,289
worldwide side is Google Cloud Storage

188
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,289
so we're starting to see a lot of these

189
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,070
Google and Dropbox and that type of

190
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:28,660
stuff being used for malware trance

191
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,310
transmission mostly because those are

192
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,740
now considered to be quote business

193
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,990
applications and most organizations will

194
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,450
never ever ever block something that's

195
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,460
supposed to be part of the business you

196
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,560
know I'll talk about an example in in a

197
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,609
couple slides here where malware was

198
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,250
using MSDN forums to transfer data back

199
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,130
and forth so it was uploading in what

200
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,570
looked like gobbly gook to a forum but

201
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,780
another piece of malware was reading

202
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,860
that form taking it encoding it

203
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,140
realizing what it was and then sending

204
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,000
its response back on the forum and again

205
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,770
from an IT perspective we look at that

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,530
as probably an IT administrator going to

207
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,810
MST of MSDN forms and looking up

208
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,119
information this was take a CLE a

209
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,710
transport mechanism from malware so

210
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,960
we're starting to see more and more and

211
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,719
more of you know these type of Google

212
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,969
storage cloud platforms the presentation

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,800
earlier on the the video transport now

214
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,110
again that's super cool we're seeing

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
more and more of that type of stuff the

216
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,280
malware actors out there are really

217
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,080
really really smart people and they're

218
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,570
really thinking outside of the box how

219
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,270
to get around traditional traditional

220
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,429
mechanisms that in enterprises that put

221
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,900
in on the Canada side though what's

222
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,719
surprising is we're still seeing mostly

223
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,640
email well number one is email I

224
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,090
wouldn't say mostly email but number one

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,199
is still email if you look at SMT pop3

226
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,300
IMAP and you know I always laugh when I

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,370
see pop3 I mean who's using pop3 in the

228
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,229
enterprise this is a lot of people with

229
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,730
iPhones or Android that have set up

230
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,680
their home devices you know and we're

231
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,540
seeing that stuff transfer through but

232
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,479
if you look at the numbers it

233
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,060
a substantial amount not an amount of

234
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,150
malware still hitting that and again if

235
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,430
you look all the way down Google has hit

236
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,740
this one as well so we're seeing Google

237
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,930
again Google's that in this specific

238
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,210
specific example is the cloud storage

239
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,239
being actually a big mechanism to

240
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,910
transfer malware mostly down this is you

241
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,530
know when you click on a link we're

242
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,939
pulling this stuff down from Google and

243
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,680
then it's executing on or on our

244
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,170
desktops but this is really where we're

245
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,449
starting to see a lot of organizations

246
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,880
you know kind of allowing stuff that

247
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,880
they shouldn't be and again I chuckle IT

248
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,460
guy right FTP really who allows FTP out

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,890
and in still turns out a lot of people

250
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:47,140
do because it sits in the top seven here

251
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,460
on both sides now the other thing that

252
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,460
we look at here is the top industries

253
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,630
now high tech in the u.s. is a little

254
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,970
bit of anomaly because there are

255
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,430
organizations like ourselves checkpoint

256
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,410
Microsoft Amazon these are all

257
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,209
considered to be high tech right so

258
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,010
they're getting hit more than anyone

259
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,810
else is because everyone's trying to you

260
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,730
know to disrupt but if you look at

261
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,469
wholesale and retail and education being

262
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,440
kind of two and three within the world

263
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,230
wide target list versus Canada Insurance

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,840
being number one I don't know if that's

265
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,150
because we've got a very large you know

266
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,790
provider of insurance locally here in

267
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,120
Winnipeg or if that just happens to be

268
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,579
what what you know what organizations

269
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,410
are looking at you know basically

270
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,120
attacking but you kind of go through and

271
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,290
see education is up there as well state

272
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,070
and local government along that type of

273
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,230
stuff so high tech in Canada again is

274
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,420
quite low now again I don't know if this

275
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,540
is because high tech in Canada is a very

276
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,520
small sub sector of our of our

277
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,530
industries right most high tech is in

278
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,560
Silicon Valley that's just the nature of

279
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,600
where people get started but if this is

280
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,680
more of a target attack at high tech

281
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,090
versus other industries and again so the

282
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,489
other thing I looked at here was where

283
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,820
is the source of this malware coming

284
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,210
from so worldwide surprisingly despite

285
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,370
all of the stuff you read in the media

286
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,100
us is number one the distribution of

287
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,790
malware is coming from the US and again

288
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,370
if you look at this

289
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,459
I'd probably you know five or six times

290
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,690
as much France is number two I kind of

291
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,130
thought that was funny you know we

292
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,330
always kind of think of France as wiving

293
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,670
waving the white flag well they're

294
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,290
pretty active in the I shouldn't say

295
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,640
that there's probably that's probably on

296
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,219
YouTube so I was gonna put something

297
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,630
here but if you look at the Canada you

298
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,160
know landscape here as well

299
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,700
Canada is number one for attacking

300
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,100
Canada so again we have a lot of

301
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,870
enterprises that are blocking Russia

302
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,370
China Zimbabwe Nigeria which is great

303
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,390
but it's a very small percentage of the

304
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,150
malware that's actually hitting

305
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,730
organizations so again us number one

306
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,199
Netherlands being number three or us be

307
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,030
number two Netherlands being number

308
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,890
three and it's funny that France even

309
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,300
being kind of the second most active

310
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,520
here isn't even on the Canadian

311
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,490
landscape right so you can kind of see

312
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,430
where we fall into a very niche of you

313
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,850
know what's gonna call collateral damage

314
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:15,550
from some of these much larger campaigns

315
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:17,770
so the next thing I did was I looked at

316
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,490
the the top actor so these are

317
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:24,400
individuals or individual groups that

318
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,430
are actually attacking or providing

319
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,990
malware around the world so worldwide we

320
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,180
you know we see some very very large

321
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,550
groups doing this stuff and and and make

322
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,680
Sim is number one by far go on out by

323
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,939
far but number one and Gorgon group is

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,359
is number three these are the only two

325
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:46,420
active actors that we saw in Canada

326
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,910
during that time now again remember this

327
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,069
is first instances only I'm not saying

328
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,949
that we didn't see anything from apt 33

329
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,600
but it wasn't a first instance it wasn't

330
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,910
a you know let's call it a targeted

331
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,250
attack to a Canadian organization this

332
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,469
is you know very specific so Gorgon

333
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,760
group again if you you know we're gonna

334
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,730
go through a little bit about what these

335
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,710
organizations do Gorgon group basically

336
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,030
is responsible for a lot of the the

337
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,410
commercial malware we see out there

338
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,780
today you know they're using Loki

339
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,880
they're using a couple of the rat tools

340
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,910
that are out there again they're

341
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,630
specifically looking at using Microsoft

342
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,310
documents to provide a second foothold

343
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,730
in and

344
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:34,949
using the Microsoft document as a

345
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:36,630
secondary download or a downloader we're

346
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,100
starting to see some very very advanced

347
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,450
things happening with Microsoft

348
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,640
documents so we actually saw one a

349
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,910
couple of months ago that when you

350
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,800
opened it it was non malicious and it

351
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,910
actually pulled information from your

352
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,670
website

353
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,260
so not really a targeted attack but it

354
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,390
was actually pulling based on the domain

355
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,339
of the email information from the

356
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,170
website to populate the document so you

357
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,520
open this up and you actually see a

358
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,020
bunch of stuff from your website and you

359
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,210
kind of look at it and you you start

360
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,310
reading it because it looks legit as you

361
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,790
scroll through when you hit the third

362
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:11,130
page the exploit kicked in so not on

363
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,719
page one or two on the third page the

364
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,370
exploit kicked in it actually

365
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,170
compromised the system and downloaded

366
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,520
the new payload so when you're looking

367
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,670
at things like that the reason that

368
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,670
happens is most next-generation

369
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,260
antivirus only looks at initial opening

370
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,420
it doesn't wait thirty or forty or fifty

371
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,760
seconds to see what happens it says open

372
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,560
the file what's going on in the file

373
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,720
nothing's going on the file I'm good to

374
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,369
go it doesn't wait to see if you scroll

375
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,780
through so we're starting to see more

376
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,870
and more of that type of stuff happening

377
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:45,390
in the industry so Gorgan here

378
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:48,650
specifically basically what all they did

379
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:51,839
here and again this is a very kind of

380
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,180
simplistic version of malware so there

381
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,800
was a file normal you know you know with

382
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:02,880
normal dot dot M you know basically of a

383
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:05,699
template for Word documents we saw them

384
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,030
use this across you know almost all of

385
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:15,060
their all of their attacks that we saw

386
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:18,240
in Canada up until May 21st May 21st

387
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,849
they changed so May 21st we saw the

388
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,740
first three instances of a file that was

389
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,850
specifically called DHL and there was

390
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,410
something it was either an account

391
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,570
number or something and they actually

392
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,930
changed it to an RTF file so instead of

393
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,880
using a docx file is now an RTF file so

394
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,939
I dug in a little bit more in that

395
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,650
timeframe between May 21st and June 3rd

396
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,429
we actually only saw we saw 13 other

397
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,799
instances of this file of this

398
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:45,858
Gorgon group RTF files 12 of those files

399
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,228
were absolutely just give garbage and

400
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:50,779
naming they were you know 16 to 32

401
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:53,839
characters long mostly just you know

402
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:56,959
random generated you know very kind of

403
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,379
you know very easy to spot very you know

404
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,508
kind of generic in in the naming one was

405
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,819
called original invoice doc okay again

406
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,799
getting a little bit more creative but

407
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:09,769
when we looked at it these three

408
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,949
documents were created for their

409
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,019
intended target so Gorgon actually

410
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:18,348
changed the way they did their

411
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:21,169
distribution specifically for that one

412
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:22,549
target changed their distribution method

413
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:23,209
so they've actually started using RTF

414
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,189
since dead

415
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,258
change the naming scheme it's not

416
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:29,449
auto-generated and actually changed the

417
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:31,549
payload within those organizations so in

418
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:33,919
this case again I'm not a threat

419
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:36,978
researcher but in this case this looks

420
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,489
very very highly like this organization

421
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:44,689
targeted that one individual company for

422
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:46,429
for these for these new files now the

423
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:48,949
reason I say it looks like it is this

424
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:51,529
could also just been a new test of a new

425
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:53,719
set of malware it looks like it wasn't

426
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:57,350
very successful because after June 3rd

427
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,689
we didn't see it again so very specific

428
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,149
very short timeframe but then it wasn't

429
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:05,990
actually carried out any any further

430
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,970
after these dates alright the next group

431
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,859
that we saw here within Canada during

432
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,459
this time frame was makes him write this

433
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:16,029
is number one in nor in worldwide makes

434
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:20,209
him is a Russian malware author

435
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:23,388
specifically around Android so very you

436
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,299
know very advanced Android malware

437
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:27,529
looking specifically to steal SMS is you

438
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,000
know again I don't know why people want

439
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,799
to steal SMS is if you look at what I'm

440
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,480
saying it's usually running late coming

441
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,710
home do you need milk so I'm not quite

442
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,100
sure why people are stealing this type

443
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:42,799
of stuff but sure yeah okay again very

444
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,519
very you know generic type of malware

445
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,220
sorry very specific malware to Android

446
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:52,730
is makes them to you know targeting

447
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,030
Canada probably not we only saw one file

448
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,429
in that whole time in one net new file

449
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,070
there was almost 8000 samples seen

450
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,720
worldwide for one or out for one file to

451
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,520
make it to Canada that was probably just

452
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,530
a little bit of off spray you know

453
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,690
probably using an IP that they didn't

454
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,178
realize it really doesn't look like this

455
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,309
was a target towards Canada at all so

456
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,080
yeah not that it's not important to know

457
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:20,120
about but we're not really being

458
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,290
targeted by by this specific sorry

459
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,540
something's moving over here I'll show

460
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,889
you so many signs or not know this

461
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,510
specific malware author so taking taking

462
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,000
a look at the campaigns now so those

463
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:36,500
were specific actors now campaigns are

464
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,980
more of generic groups of of activities

465
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,990
targeted at the same end goal so it

466
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,850
could be you know crypto mining it could

467
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,710
be you know credential theft all that

468
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,620
type of stuff so worldwide you know

469
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,299
again we've seen some very specific ones

470
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,820
but again within Canada a silver carrier

471
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,918
is by far the the highest that we've

472
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,399
seen and will con talk about this a

473
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,049
little bit more and a couple crypto

474
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,640
jackers here and the kody crypto

475
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:02,990
campaign one is I think is interesting

476
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,450
we'll talk a little bit about that one

477
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,220
as well again I'm coming this from it

478
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,020
from an enterprise side of things

479
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,090
who's running Kodi within their

480
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,809
enterprise well turns out people are and

481
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:16,730
they were targeted so don't don't do

482
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,500
that just in general don't don't run

483
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,870
Kodi at work perfect

484
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,929
okay so silver Terrier so this is a

485
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,399
Nigerian campaign so the one thing

486
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,130
that's interesting about this is these

487
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,410
guys do not write their own malware it

488
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,059
is malware as a service mostly and

489
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,700
believe it or not an hour of the service

490
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,910
is a huge huge industry it is off the

491
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,059
shelf or off the dark web these this

492
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,940
team is buying generic malware and

493
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,980
basically brute forcing it these are

494
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,799
very very effective campaigns because

495
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,320
they are hitting hundreds of millions of

496
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,780
people with it so are they targeting

497
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,909
Canada no they are targeting in the

498
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,710
world they're you know what they are

499
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,870
trying to do is basically spray and pray

500
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,510
as much as possible they don't want to

501
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,309
go after you know very secure

502
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,110
environments they are really just hoping

503
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,470
someone clicks on it and gets them in

504
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,449
for me

505
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,980
to get your bank account and steal some

506
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,259
money from you that is really all

507
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,120
they're trying to do this is one of the

508
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,330
most effective campaigns that we have

509
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,979
seen just because of undereducated

510
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:23,120
end-users and the amount of volume that

511
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:26,539
they are willing to put out the second

512
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,189
one here this vs VBS cryptocurrency we

513
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,870
see cryptocurrency going through the

514
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,960
roof especially fireless cryptocurrency

515
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,449
attacks this is kind of the the new the

516
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,950
new haven right this is the new

517
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,350
credential theft if we if these

518
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,809
organizations can get in and steal your

519
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,939
compute resources to make money they

520
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,460
will now the one thing that I think is

521
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,549
hilarious about this is most times

522
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,220
people that are are clicking these links

523
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,450
in getting crypto jacked already have

524
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,340
other malware on that machine because

525
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,139
they're not very you know educated and

526
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,689
the machine is slow as crap to begin

527
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:02,120
with so they're hitting dumb people with

528
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,860
slow machines which is a very very low

529
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,370
chance of them actually ever kind of

530
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,139
making any money doing it so it is free

531
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,539
compute but for no apparent reason

532
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:13,519
so one of the school divisions here and

533
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,049
I won't name names they actually allowed

534
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,120
a few of these things to go through just

535
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,090
to see how active they could actually

536
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,529
get it they didn't win a single you know

537
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,330
it bit sorry I'm sorry I'm gonna pray

538
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:27,740
for you they didn't win anything right

539
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,899
so they didn't make any money they just

540
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,639
basically ran cycles on laptops for no

541
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:33,258
apparent reason so again I'm sure

542
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:36,019
somewhere out there you know

543
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:38,029
organizations are are making money at

544
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:41,720
this but this one definitely is really

545
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:44,000
not this one's another interesting one

546
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,200
so my little forum book is a it's

547
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,759
basically a variant of the original form

548
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,649
book this is another one that was very

549
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:57,559
very interesting so on 6 618 they had

550
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:59,779
been using PDFs up until that point

551
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,908
oh sorry they've been using personal

552
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,250
executables so little AFC files that

553
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:07,549
type of stuff up into that point 6 618

554
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,710
they changed dead stop stopped using

555
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:12,620
Pease almost a hundred percent started

556
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,409
using word files verse 3 also hit

557
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,629
Candida so very similar to what happened

558
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:19,009
with the first one I talked about first

559
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,370
three files were now targeted

560
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:23,550
specifically at Canada

561
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,350
now talking to the unit 42 team about

562
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,559
these files it does not look like they

563
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,490
were specific to the Canadian

564
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,430
organization it looks like they were

565
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:36,630
testing a new delivery method but after

566
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:38,309
this point almost 100% of their of their

567
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,370
new malware distribution was through

568
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:44,280
Word files so obviously or I guess not

569
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,469
obviously but one could assume that they

570
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,510
were very successful and the pease were

571
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,730
not being very successful so they've now

572
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,220
moved their their distribution methods

573
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,280
through to word files so again probably

574
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,270
not a very specific targeted attack

575
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,580
within Canada but a test two to test

576
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:06,960
their new viability of of a new payload

577
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,210
and a new distribution method um so here

578
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,730
this one this cody crypto campaign so

579
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,059
again yeah automatic how many people

580
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,920
here Cody boxes mine is really slow and

581
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,559
old if you were to load anything on here

582
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,630
you would not win anything so again

583
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,690
there was only you know seventy two

584
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,880
samples seen worldwide again this is an

585
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,429
enterprise look view of these or of

586
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,650
these type of malware again who's

587
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:33,990
running Cody at work you probably

588
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,660
shouldn't be but okay that's that's a

589
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,910
whole different conversation to have

590
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,559
again three of the three only three were

591
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:44,190
seen in Canada so again a very limited

592
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,020
amount of Cody exploit going on within

593
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,500
the world but again it's something that

594
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,429
we do see a little bit of I'm running

595
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,350
out of time so I want to talk

596
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,170
specifically about this one

597
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,678
so Helsing so how saying is a is a group

598
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:00,390
that actually targets other advanced

599
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,360
threat actors so it's kind of like the

600
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:06,330
Dexter of cyber warfare

601
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,330
they only attack other people that are

602
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,639
attacking countries that's kind of neat

603
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,428
I think that's interesting so they

604
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,760
targeted the the neon group here you

605
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:20,190
know again in the mid middle of the of

606
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,890
the year I don't believe that we have

607
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,530
any neon group members acting within

608
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,120
Canada so this is probably just kind of

609
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,310
collateral damage from a much larger

610
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,449
campaign that happened again and we

611
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,850
don't know why it would have happened in

612
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,130
can

613
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:35,230
but it is something that's you know kind

614
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,820
of interesting that to see that you know

615
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,580
these groups now are starting to

616
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,649
attacking each other and you know that's

617
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,480
you know becoming the cyber warfare

618
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,820
that's you know that we've heard about

619
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,470
for so many years so really the question

620
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,919
you know that I started this was is

621
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,100
Canada a target overall I would say no

622
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,310
we aren't really a specified target for

623
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,899
most of these organizations we've seen a

624
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,409
little bit of stuff being targeted

625
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,910
within Canada but it doesn't necessarily

626
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,400
you know we don't really see a lot of

627
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,440
very specific targeted attacks to Canada

628
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,270
so this should if you're an IT security

629
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,500
professional change of the way you think

630
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,450
a little bit about how you're protecting

631
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,580
your networks right we're not

632
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,160
necessarily working worrying about those

633
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,230
netnews zero-days these things have been

634
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,750
seen elsewhere in the world so start

635
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,880
looking at using other mechanisms to

636
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,770
pull information into your into your

637
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
organization where you don't have to

638
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,740
necessarily be the first person to

639
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,480
prevent it but you want to make sure

640
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,400
that you're actually taking advantage of

641
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,230
a lot of these you know these free share

642
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,490
Spamhaus lists and a lot of type of

643
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,520
stuff to make sure that you're actually

644
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:42,550
utilizing other people's misfortune to

645
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,460
protect yourself I've been told times up

646
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,320
so if anyone has any questions please

647
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,670
grab me I'll be stick around during

648
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,980
