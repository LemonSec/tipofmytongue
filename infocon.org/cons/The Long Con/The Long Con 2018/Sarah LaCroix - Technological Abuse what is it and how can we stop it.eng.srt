5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,380
pretty early on a Sunday morning and

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,960
we're all confused about the time change

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,320

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,330

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,830
you watching on YouTube on demand later

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,400
thank you for taking the time to watch

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,370
this

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,440
so about me my name is Sarah and I'm a

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,809
business information technology student

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,699
at Red River College and I'm graduating

15
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:44,930
in April whoo thank you yeah thank you

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,239
so I have some previous experience

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,030
working with at-risk youth and young

18
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,209
adults and I'm interested in how people

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,460
use technology so I thought that I would

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,090
use my education to make the world a

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,010
better place and so here I am my contact

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,390
information is at the bottom and I'll

23
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:08,030
show it again at the end so today we

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,909
will be discussing what is abuse who's

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,110
affected by abuse what is technological

26
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:15,049
abuse and how can we prevent

27
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:19,340
technological abuse I'm not going to be

28
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:21,049
going into too many specifics or really

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,710
difficult details but I get that this is

30
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:26,450
a heavy topic so if you need to excuse

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,309
yourself for a few minutes I get that

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,710
you know talk to someone you care about

33
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:36,049
and you know to take care of you so

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:39,229
first off what is abuse well it's easily

35
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,840
defined as any action used to control or

36
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:47,689
control control the behavior of another

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,549
person it exploits trust so if you're

38
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,720
dependent you trust the victim and

39
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:56,900
they're vulnerable it's grounds for it

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,789
makes abuse easy to happen there are

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,500
several types of abuse we have physical

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:05,119
emotional financial sexual spiritual and

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:10,310
technological so those are kind of the

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,769
main areas and anyone anyone at all like

45
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,790
regardless of age gender identity sexual

46
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:18,230
orientation race nationality religion

47
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,140
occupation income level like I I do

48
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:25,190
really mean anyone can be a victim or

49
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,619
perpetrator of abuse some examples there

50
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,590
domestic abuse happens between romantic

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,450
partners child abuse will happen between

52
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,060
a child and adults and elder abuse

53
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,399
happens between an elder another like

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:42,050
typically younger person so one of their

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,830
children or a caregiver some of the risk

56
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,150
factors for abuse caregiver stress

57
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,180
dependency on the other person family

58
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,190
conflict isolation psychological

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,980
problems and they're being addictions

60
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:59,150
and although anyone can be affected by

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,190
abuse these risk factors tend to make it

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,290
significantly more likely that you will

63
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,290
experience abuse in your lifetime so

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,380
technological abuse uses technology to

65
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,269
control harass intimidate people and it

66
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,989
usually happens in conjunction with

67
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:21,260
other areas of abuse the four main areas

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,750
we have disrupting use of technology so

69
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,980
that would be in that category like

70
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,420
denying use of Technology hiding devices

71
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,828
look locking victims out of their

72
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:36,619
account could be demanding that they

73
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:40,220
that access to devices be given at all

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,260
times impersonation so locking in or

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,600
logging into accounts and pretending to

76
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,950
be the victim creating copycat accounts

77
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,190
identity theft in other ways using

78
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,959
technology harassment I think most of us

79
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,540
are familiar with this one because we

80
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,450
have the internet trolling bully and

81
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,450
constant messages emails calls and then

82
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,369
monitoring so that would be trackers key

83
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,010
loggers checking phone bills which is

84
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,900
really really creepy I was looking at my

85
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,929
phone bill researching this talk and

86
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,290
it's very creepy the amount of

87
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,090
information that is on there accessing

88
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,769
accounts or devices without permission

89
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,679
and often without the other person

90
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,990
knowing as well as demanding account

91
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,000
passwords to personal devices or

92
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,979
accounts I will say that consent is the

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,140
major thing here like there I mean there

94
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,659
are often times where people will share

95
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,150
devices or

96
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,770
and I mean if it's consensual then

97
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,909
that's okay but consent is key so we

98
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,180
have a lot of challenges surrounding

99
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,610
technology and abuse there's a tendency

100
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,160
to trivialize a text role and abuse and

101
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,590
blame the victim will often hear things

102
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,690
like well get off the internet change

103
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,810
your phone number oh my god you're just

104
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,640
being dramatic or the attitude that it's

105
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,380
their fault for being on the internet or

106
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,630
using a small smart device like they

107
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,120
somehow brought it upon themselves which

108
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:10,150
is kind of crazy because we all have

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,860
devices we're all on the internet and I

110
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,159
mean we wouldn't be okay with that

111
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:19,500
happening to us it's also difficult to

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,940
detect laws and social services

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,130
providers and agencies haven't really

114
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,830
adapted to the new technology because

115
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:30,280
it's changing so fast so it's really

116
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,400
difficult to to provide services and

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,229
give good good advice and good counsel

118
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,969
around that because they literally don't

119
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:43,200
know anything about it so these risks

120
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,640
there are ways to minimize the

121
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,159
likelihood or the risk of technology

122
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,630
abuse happening to you so in the home

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
it's recommended that you share the

124
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,070
responsibility for setting up and

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,109
maintaining the tech a lot of times I

126
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,040
mean there's a division of labor that

127
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,919
happens

128
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,660
I hate sweeping the floors and my

129
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,469
partner will sweep the floors all the

130
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,180
time thank you

131
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,669
because I hate doing it but I I do more

132
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,310
of the laundry and that just that's how

133
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,780
it works out and also in the home often

134
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,990
there will be one person who's more

135
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,119
interested in setting up the tech and

136
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,360
maintaining it and buying the devices

137
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,980
and stuff so and that happens just make

138
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,320
sure that everyone in the home is aware

139
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,740
of what's being installed what is

140
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,510
internet connected you know and that

141
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,060
they have some sort of say in it like if

142
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,640
one person is not comfortable with a

143
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,930
Google home or Alexa then maybe don't

144
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,820
just veto that decision in by one where

145
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,479
possible address any risk factors

146
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,960
associated with abuse stress addictions

147
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,449
isolation

148
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:55,460
mental-health issues family conflict and

149
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:58,580
dependency dressing these also helped to

150
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,008
minimize the risk and raise awareness of

151
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,719
technological abuse as a real form of

152
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:06,080
abuse and helped to educate the public

153
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,229
on what healthy tech use looks like so

154
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,909
us being people NIT we are in a position

155
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,880
of power because we have a lot more

156
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,440
knowledge than the average person and

157
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,240
that can be used for good or for evil

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,460
and I would hope that everyone here is

159
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,949
using it for good and that does also

160
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,849
mean at home and with your grandma and

161
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:29,479
stuff like that so if you are loved one

162
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,340
need help call 9-1-1 right now don't

163
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,370
wait don't hesitate don't worry about it

164
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,849
call 9-1-1 if there is immediate danger

165
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,400
i have a list of resources available by

166
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:43,940
province and some best practices for

167
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,960
shelters in assessing technology misuse

168
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,460
and safety and how to keep people safe

169
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,400
if you are worried about someone

170
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,560
tracking you or your internet use or

171
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,210
anything like that go and use a public

172
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,190
computer this is probably one of the

173
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,008
only time someone up here will advocate

174
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,719
that but in this situation it's okay you

175
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,409
can use a public computer you probably

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,960
should that's all I really have for you

177
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:12,139
today I apparently there is a cat tax

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,210
for being here so there is a kitty and a

179
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,610
snake just chilling out being best

180
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,729
friends yeah

181
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,860
hit me up on social media or I'll be

182
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,960
wandering around here again I'm

183
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,040
graduating in April and I have business

184
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:33,189
cards so thank you for being here

185
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:35,930
[Applause]

186
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,969
sure so the question was can I explain

187
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,669
the distinction between emotional and

188
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,219
spiritual abuse I mean they are very

189
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,920
similar emotional abuse you would be

190
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,350
attacking the person and setting out to

191
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,050
like hurt their feelings or minimize

192
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,010
them in some way spiritual abuse would

193
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,229
be minimizing or otherwise attacking a

194
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,350
person's religion or spirituality that

195
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,540
can also include denying them the right

196
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,940
to go to their preferred house of

197
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,339
worship were there any other questions

198
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:21,170
okay

199
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:24,020
okay yep right yeah so a lot of times

200
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,439
and I've seen this happen firsthand

201
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,540
where one partner will go through the

202
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,670
other partners phone bill and track the

203
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,209
calls that are being made and they are

204
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:39,380
all listed I did notice on mine as well

205
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:41,300
they listed timestamps dates and

206
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,570
locations I was accessing the internet

207
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,279
as well it didn't have many more details

208
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,860
than that so not sure if it was just

209
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,649
using the port number to assume I was on

210
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,050
the internet but that was on their phone

211
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,630
calls are also they were all timestamp

212
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:03,109
date stamped and everything so that can

213
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:04,550
be used to be tracking phone use okay

214
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:11,839
you in the front and then I'll get you

215
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:15,079
in the back just the city so not exact

216
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,010
location but it's a yeah yeah sensitive

217
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:21,579
enough yeah okay sorry one and back and

218
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,579
then I'll get you

219
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:35,510
yes so the last time I talked to the

220
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,939
resources in this area was a few years

221
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:42,200
ago and they were generally really

222
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:44,120
dismissive online when I was looking it

223
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,740
was it was a mix there were some that

224
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,960
just didn't even acknowledge that it

225
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,670
existed there were some that were just

226
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,860
like okay if you're a victim of abuse

227
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,329
just get rid of your devices and then

228
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,220
there were others that were much more

229
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,380
progressive and okay these are the steps

230
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,580
you can take and it looks like they have

231
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,880
training in place to help help workers

232
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,120
kind of assess what is actually a risk

233
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,370
in how they can help deal with that and

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,530
empower their client to you know move on

235
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:27,200
with their lives and so are you to

236
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:30,429
question Hey

237
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,429
[Music]

238
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,430
so the question was how does this relate

239
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,439
to when you're going to the US border

240
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,300
and they demand that you unlock your

241
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,160
phone and log into your social media

242
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,609
devices and they look and stuff how does

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,500
that factor in admittedly I don't know

244
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,540
what ton about that in particular but I

245
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,290
would say that it's absolutely an abuse

246
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:09,250
of power and it's a way to control it is

247
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:12,310
not usually done it's usually very

248
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,050
targeted who is asked to do that and so

249
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:19,569
if it's not being applied equally it's

250
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:22,290
definitely a form of abusing power okay

251
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,290
mailee honest

252
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,560
okay so the question was do I think that

253
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,540
there should be an ethics course for

254
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,030
technology professionals in the school

255
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,760
and stuff and then if they violate that

256
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,920
them not be able to you know practice

257
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,290
doing their code or whatever it is in

258
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,540
the future I'm a huge advocate for

259
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,969
teaching ethics I think that it's very

260
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,400
important to know where you stand and

261
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,610
know what your rights are especially as

262
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,449
someone who has as much power as I will

263
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:15,790
graduating the challenge with that is it

264
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,490
seems like no one cares like I know in

265
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,040
my classes I was required to do a

266
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,560
presentation and do some research on the

267
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,719
ethics and technology it's something

268
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,479
that I was required to take when I was

269
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,190
in Scotland I'm not sure about the

270
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,590
University requirements but it was

271
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,690
something that I felt was really really

272
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,000
important and is something that I want

273
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,550
to be conscious of when I go into the

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,740
field however it seems that a lot of my

275
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,500
classmates don't care and it's hard to

276
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,620
make that relevant to them I would hope

277
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,220
that so we can find a way to make people

278
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:55,810
care and make them realise that it is

279
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,930
relevant so I hope that it becomes more

280
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,489
of a requirement and not just well we're

281
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,550
doing this economics course I'm gonna

282
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:07,660
mention some ethics to you but I don't

283
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:13,300
know if we're there yet were there any

284
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:23,520
other questions okay you in the front

285
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:23,520
again sure okay

286
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,430
so one of the things that I've been

287
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:40,290
doing is working with voices which is

288
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,120
Manitoba's youth and care network and

289
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,569
I've been involved with them for many

290
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,760
years and I was involved with them

291
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,950
before I started school what I've been

292
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,330
doing with them is just kind of making

293
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,040
them aware I when I'm talking to their

294
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,620
youths I mentioned their rights like

295
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,360
part of this talk came from a bunch of

296
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,980
their youth saying that their social

297
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,050
workers told them they were not allowed

298
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,840
to have facebook or any other devices

299
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,760
unless they handed their password over

300
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,190
yeah so I had to sit them down be like

301
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,610
nope you don't have to do that and they

302
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:17,340
can't bully you into doing that so with

303
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,440
other shelters and stuff you could try

304
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,330
talking to them and emailing them seeing

305
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,570
if they have any kind of like open

306
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:27,360
groups or any sort of area where they're

307
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,360
looking to have someone volunteer to

308
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,290
help with that I sorry I don't have a

309
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,590
better answer that was kind of rambling

310
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,589
and Shaab

311
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,670
absolutely

312
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:59,810
yeah yeah yeah

313
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,660
okay

314
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,590
okay

315
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,210
okay so your question was then what do

316
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,090
we do about the abuse of abuse like okay

317
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,980
that that again is another really

318
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,110
challenging area because we want to make

319
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,730
sure that everyone is taken seriously so

320
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,760
that people feel like they can come

321
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,680
forward but at the same time having this

322
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,180
whole blanket everyone's right and I am

323
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,209
ignoring everyone who says otherwise

324
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:58,859
because they'd be haters is like I'm a

325
00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:02,430
little bit too skeptical to I wouldn't

326
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,470
want to just say that every like

327
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,909
everyone who says they are being abused

328
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,220
is right and everyone who says that

329
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:12,000
they're not is like that that person is

330
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,700
not is wrong but I really don't know how

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,700
to handle that I I don't know what we

332
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,280
should do about that I would just like

333
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,140
us all to be decent human beings but we

334
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:28,580
wouldn't be having this discussion if we

335
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,580
weren't having these issues and you

336
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:43,450
right yeah

337
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,620
okay cool

338
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,760
sure sure

339
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:22,880
so it is really true that a lot of times

340
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,590
the reasoning behind being like you have

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,610
to give up your passwords and all your

342
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:31,100
social media if you want to have them it

343
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:34,399
is true that that is often being said

344
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,429
out of the I want to protect you I want

345
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,240
like the youth may be gang involved or

346
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:43,550
have other issues going on or addictions

347
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,740
and so the idea might be to try to

348
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:51,110
protect them from that however they

349
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,060
still have that right to privacy and we

350
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:57,189
can't just assume that they're going to

351
00:18:53,060 --> 00:19:00,080
access social media to get into trouble

352
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,390
but when I did do some looking into this

353
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,780
I interviewed a bunch of social workers

354
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:08,570
I knew as well as youth care workers and

355
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:12,530
I found it very interesting because all

356
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,899
of them said that they would not demand

357
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,370
the passwords of their own children

358
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,680
because they knew that their children

359
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,510
were being fine but they would demand

360
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,980
the passwords of the youth they were

361
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,590
working with because they were probably

362
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,210
getting into trouble there seem to be a

363
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,820
lot more concern that someone was going

364
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,440
to harm their own kids but the kids that

365
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,330
were their clients were just getting

366
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,050
into trouble and because of that bias

367
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,370
I'm skeptical that it's purely out of

368
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,889
the goodness of their hearts that

369
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,570
they're asking for passwords I don't

370
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,940
think that's always the case and I think

371
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,590
that people should know what their

372
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:55,220
rights are and they do have that right

373
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:59,060
to privacy sue yeah

374
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,860
I don't know either because like in a

375
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,040
lot of these cases these kids have

376
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,760
public profiles anyways I have found

377
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,340
everything I need to know without having

378
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,520
to actually access anyone or anyone's

379
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,159
account that's another issue altogether

380
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,190
the having a completely public profile

381
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,830
but yeah I haven't actually ever needed

382
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,610
to access anyone's account to figure out

383
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,610
if they're in trouble

384
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:44,979
sorry what was that

385
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:49,419
oh yes correct yeah so it might be for

386
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:51,160
accessing private messages that if you

387
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,560
can't see that by going on a public

388
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,360
profile okay so I have like two minutes

389
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,360
left do I have any other questions okay

390
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,629
so I am going to leave the stage now

391
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,210
because we have other amazing speakers

392
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:10,810
that are going to come up and rock your

393
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,220
world if you have any questions or want

394
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,990
to chat with me

395
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,670
I'll be around so just give me a few

396
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,830
minutes to kind of calm down this is

397
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,520
like super nerve-wracking thank you all

398
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,520
for being here
