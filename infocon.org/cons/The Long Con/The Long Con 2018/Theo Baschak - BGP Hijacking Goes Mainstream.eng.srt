1
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,240
so I'm going to talk about BGP again

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,360
this year I think it's the fourth year

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,240
in a row maybe the fifth this year I'm

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,730
going to talk about how BGP has kind of

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,310
gone mainstream and it's gotten into the

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,270
news quite a lot this year and there's a

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:30,930
lot of emojis in my presentation because

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,370
they were quite easy to do so Who am I

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,980
I'm starting a new job tomorrow as

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,699
network operations manager at broadband

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:43,150
communications North I'm super involved

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:46,810
in the internet scene community but not

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,879
in Manitoba I'm involved behind the

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,100
scenes and a number of ISPs and service

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,840
providers I have a blog called BGP guru

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,510
I used to be Cisco do dotnet but I

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,770
changed it to BGP guru because if you

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,820
get a three-letter domain you better use

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,710
it right so mmm-hmm I I'm involved with

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,530
the internet exchange both on the board

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,839
level and the operations team I'm also

22
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,950
involved in called hack which is a local

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,460
not-for-profit that attempts to further

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,619
privacy in Canada and I'm also a

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,530
co-founder of the Manitoba Network

26
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:27,119
Operations Group and I've recently

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,159
discovered that I absolutely love curry

28
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,869
and so I even started the food blog

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:38,770
about that so I could publish one or two

30
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:43,780
recipes per year so the first event I

31
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:50,318
want to talk about is this 2017 Russian

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:51,670
leak slash hijack so if you alright so

33
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:59,200
next year I'm gonna use latex for my

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:02:01,299
slides so if you do a google for russian

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,630
google bgp hijack there was a lot of

36
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:09,910
news items from December of 2017 about

37
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:11,799
this one here so the networks that were

38
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,459
affected for this one here included

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,100
Google and YouTube Facebook Microsoft

40
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,820
twitch Riot Games and Apple plus a bunch

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,109
of Russian networks

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,150
the Russian networks were fully

43
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,730
propagated by almost all of the up

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,450
streams the the rest were only

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,399
propagated by Hurricane electric so I've

46
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,399
bolded hurricane electric here because

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,480
there's a couple pieces along the way

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:46,060
that all sort of fit into the end on

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,160
this one here so this one here there was

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,590
a lot of speculation about whether it

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,880
was malicious or not there were more

52
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:58,480
specific networks it seems like maybe it

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,970
was a traffic optimization escaped but

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,630
it's really really hard to actually say

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,960
for sure in this case a lot of people

56
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,730
noticed because upstream links were

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,190
getting congested and things weren't

58
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:18,010
working so some of the outcomes of this

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,720
one here so this guy I know named job

60
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,519
started putting a lot of pressure on

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,010
Hurricane electric to better filter

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,770
their internet exchange connections they

63
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,510
they appear extensively I don't know if

64
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,580
you guys get maybe the same Google ads

65
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,250
that I do but the Google ads I see for

66
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,710
American Electric say they have like

67
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,010
8,000 or 10,000 peering sessions so that

68
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:42,670
is a lot of different peering sessions

69
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,970
to manage filter etc it's not exactly an

70
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,739
easy job if you slack off on it

71
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,850
eventually it's gonna bite you and it's

72
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,860
gonna bite you and maybe kind of a

73
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,989
public way which is what started to

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,740
happen earlier on well this is about

75
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,300
january or so this year i'll publish

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,950
these slides later so there's a bunch of

77
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,500
links and whatnot that if you're more

78
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,850
interested you can follow them and read

79
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:10,060
some additional information so the

80
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:15,400
second event that involves BGP hijacking

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,108
this year was the Amazon DNS hijack so

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,180
if you google this one here there's tons

83
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:22,120
and tons and tons and everybody noticed

84
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,930
it was a very very visible of hijack

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:30,490
because stuff wasn't working so this

86
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:33,050
happened on April 24th of this year five

87
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,960
networks from Amazon Amazon's

88
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,270
route 53 DNS were hijacked more specific

89
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,919
networks they were all slashed twenty

90
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:48,620
fours they came from an isp in columbus

91
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:50,539
ohio it's not hasn't really been

92
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,970
determined it was malicious or not but

93
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:58,669
given the other stuff it seems like they

94
00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:01,490
were probably hacked because they were

95
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,219
slash twenty fours they they were

96
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,550
accepted but they they weren't seen by a

97
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,860
huge number of peers only about fifteen

98
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,669
percent so not the whole internet saw

99
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,250
this but unfortunately because a lot of

100
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,229
people just plonk 8.8.8.8 into their

101
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,389
devices for dns and don't bother to run

102
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:24,318
their own DNS or don't have the ability

103
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:27,740
to run it or whatever anymore Google saw

104
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,949
these hijacks and so Google was

105
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,740
returning DNS results for my ether

106
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:37,340
wallet comm that actually had an IP with

107
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:43,130
a very long TTL that resolved to an IP

108
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:46,279
in the eastern Ukraine so some of the

109
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:49,069
outcomes of this particular hijack job

110
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,080
again proposed that major DNS

111
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:55,009
authoritative service providers offer

112
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,419
rpki for origin validation so I'd spoke

113
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,849
about rpki

114
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,520
previous years here and I said that it's

115
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:03,169
a solution but really nobody's using it

116
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,229
yet and so now there's been some

117
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,139
pressure to actually use our PKI

118
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:12,080
on networks where it actually matters so

119
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,629
Amazon serves a lot of DNS for a lot of

120
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,020
the world if someone else hijacks those

121
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,639
routes some different ASN and you have

122
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,389
an easy thing that you can do to stop

123
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:27,050
that you know it's no longer you can't

124
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:31,099
overlook it anymore so if major

125
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,050
authoritative dns providers offer rpki

126
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:36,529
validations for their routes it also

127
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,680
allowed ISPs and IXP route servers to

128
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,120
drop the invalid routes and so I've

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,370
bolded IXP here because I'm going to

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,080
come back to that later on and there's a

131
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,340
there's a long Twitter thread in between

132
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,960
job and

133
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,380
Matthieu prints of CloudFlare and

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,698
basically he compared them some people

135
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,199
don't want to use our PGI because

136
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,750
there's there's the invalid data and

137
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,910
whatnot in it and he compared it to the

138
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,850
clean up that the cloud filler did for

139
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,500
one dot one dot one dot one where a ton

140
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,949
of networks we're using it internally as

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:12,680
a ping sync or whatever right and so

142
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:15,919
later on this year there was also a blog

143
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:23,680
on a medium called towards cleaning up

144
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:27,440
invalid rpki invalids by a person named

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,419
nuisance they haven't really identified

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,250
who they are however they've been pretty

147
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,940
active on the Nanog list and they've had

148
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,580
a definite effect on the the number of

149
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,370
rpki invalid certificates that are out

150
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:45,740
there the post has a nice little graph

151
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:53,060
but as it turns out I wasn't able to

152
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:54,940
include graphics very well this year so

153
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,419
the third event I want to talk about is

154
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:02,270
the BGP hijack Factory so this started

155
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:04,760
as a series of posts on the the North

156
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,659
American network operator group list by

157
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,659
a guy named Ronald Gill Matt and as it

158
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,050
turns out you know there had been some

159
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,510
BGP hijack activity that was local to

160
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,520
Winnipeg and so he talked to someone who

161
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,560
talked to someone who said well you need

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,849
to talk to this deal guy and so I've

163
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,550
actually talked to this guy on the phone

164
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:30,560
about and I explained how a BGP

165
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,150
hijacking works so in June and July of

166
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,099
2018

167
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:40,098
this is this is when this all kind of

168
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:42,289
came to a head so Ronald Guilmette sends

169
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,790
really long emails kind of like myself

170
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:50,870
and maybe some other people like mark

171
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:53,150
and and so basically he laid out this

172
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,839
this long history that this bit canal

173
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,959
company out of Portugal had you know

174
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,560
they're involved in spam

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,760
hijacking for spam all the a s ends that

176
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
they're connected with we're actually

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,830
all listed on the spam house drop list

178
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,829
and even their ipv6 slash twenty nine

179
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:18,280
was listed on the spam Hass drop list as

180
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:21,780
well and bit canal had extensive peering

181
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:26,170
at internet exchange points in Europe

182
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,130
but they had been dropped from D six for

183
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,250
bad behavior

184
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:36,100
BGP hijacking specifically so some of

185
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:39,430
the outcomes of this particular long

186
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,050
message thread bit canal was booted from

187
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,170
a bunch of transit providers and

188
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,520
internet exchanges and they basically

189
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,620
were booted off the internet with a

190
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,960
coordinated effort from a bunch of

191
00:09:47,620 --> 00:10:00,880
people who cared about not having stuff

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:10:02,890
hijacked so forth hijack I want to talk

193
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,430
about is when that involves a bunch of

194
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,430
payment systems

195
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,520
this one here happened in July of 2018

196
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,590
of this year

197
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,800
so the first hijack that was attempted

198
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:23,800
there was a bunch of twenty fours from

199
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,530
various payment processing DNS server

200
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,569
authoritative blocks that were announced

201
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,550
so one of the most from sabbath's

202
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:35,440
another going the most one was van t'v

203
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:37,599
which is formerly world pay and then

204
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,750
another one there was actually two more

205
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,860
from a network called q9 networks which

206
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,270
was a data center in Calgary

207
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,110
hence the Canadian connection on this

208
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:53,439
one here so the first attempted hijack

209
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:56,440
was by out of a company called digital

210
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,990
wireless Indonesia and that was on July

211
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,210
6 and it didn't last very long and I had

212
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,050
really really limited visibility almost

213
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:07,270
no one saw it

214
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:10,479
it wasn't very effective couple days

215
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,350
later Malaysian ISP tries the same thing

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,370
the exact same thing

217
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,850
this one here is called extreme

218
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:20,020
broadband this one here also had limited

219
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,580
visibility and then later on that day

220
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,620
they tried the same thing but they used

221
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,840
a different bgp community that actually

222
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,910
let the route propagate quite a bit more

223
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,030
so instead of only three peers seeing it

224
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,370
like 45 peer saw it which if those are

225
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:38,630
large peers that can be a significant

226
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:41,600
portion of the internet additional

227
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,520
payment processing dns authoritative

228
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,840
networks were also hijacked the next day

229
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,280
on July 11 and a couple hours later

230
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,280
which is into the next day again

231
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,760
networks the the first networks that

232
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,160
were mentioned on this slide here are

233
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,770
hijacked yet again by this this

234
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,480
Malaysian ISP and their hijack for a

235
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:07,280
pretty long time like three hours as

236
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:11,810
compared to minutes or 15 minutes and q9

237
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,850
noticed this time and to combat you know

238
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,770
this this more specific route they

239
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:21,890
brought up their own more specific route

240
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:26,180
for these 2/24 and so in this particular

241
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:28,819
case as in the Amazon one the IP that

242
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,979
was being returned by these DNS servers

243
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,740
was an IP based out of the eastern

244
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:40,610
Ukraine again wasn't the same IP but it

245
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:41,960
was based out of the same city so some

246
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,770
of the outcomes from this particular

247
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:50,300
hijack there was a lot more push for

248
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:55,430
validating ebgp routes using rpki

249
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,770
again so job who who works at NTT as

250
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,339
basically an instigator is what you told

251
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,050
me went out and pushed for people to

252
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,670
start you know if you offer a Thorat

253
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,790
ativ dns and you're a big part of the

254
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,890
internet like amazon or dying or one of

255
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,900
these guys you should be making your

256
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:15,860
routes signed so that other people can

257
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:21,800
validate them and invalidate the the non

258
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:24,830
valid ones to one of the ones that came

259
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,030
up more recently actually this actually

260
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,710
only came up about five days

261
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,370
years ago so I haven't had a huge amount

262
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,340
of time to research this one yet is

263
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:37,190
apparently China Telecom has been

264
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,660
hijacking traffic and so the way that

265
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,500
this one here is actually a little bit

266
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:47,480
different is that instead of things not

267
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,850
working it was a an interception hijack

268
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,320
so instead of hijacking traffic and

269
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,940
sending it to a different location to

270
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,250
say oh yeah this DNS server is gonna

271
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,100
respond over here instead with this fake

272
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,100
DNS response they just intercepted stuff

273
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,240
and this is actually so this came from a

274
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:09,920
paper that was just published in the the

275
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,710
military of cyber affairs and then

276
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,610
someone posted this on to the the Nanog

277
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,350
list that I'm on on October 26 so it's

278
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,400
really fresh there's a lot of news about

279
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,710
it if you type in China Telecom BGP

280
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:30,140
hijack into your search engine you'll

281
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:32,450
find a lot of stuff about this actually

282
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,110
so I did a little bit of research not a

283
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:40,940
huge amount but in 2010 they did the

284
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:42,830
same thing and you might recall that 15

285
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,730
percent of the internet won at the China

286
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:50,750
for 18 minutes I was a headline that I

287
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,340
recall from about 2010 or so and the

288
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,410
reason that they were able to do this is

289
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,190
they had the backbone capacity that

290
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,100
intentional or not

291
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,650
when BGP things went crazy they were

292
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:09,980
able to take that traffic and still

293
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:14,569
deliver it so this particular paper says

294
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:17,870
that these hijacks were enabled because

295
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:23,750
China Telecom has an extensive presence

296
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:26,090
in the US and so essentially they are

297
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,000
able to insert themselves in without too

298
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,690
much latency and because of the way the

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,180
BGP works the IAS pass weren't any

300
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,240
longer and so these things actually

301
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,279
worked so some of the traffic that they

302
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,730
they claimed was high

303
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:47,109
was between Canada and Korea in 2016

304
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,959
between US and Italy in 2016

305
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:54,499
between Scandinavia and Japan in April

306
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:59,388
and May of 2017 and Italy to Thailand

307
00:15:54,499 --> 00:16:03,999
between April and July of 2017 so

308
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:07,579
because these were interception hijacks

309
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:09,980
you can gain a lot of information by

310
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,449
seeing what sort of traffic is flowing

311
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,759
through your network if you're able to

312
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:21,378
to get this this stuff flowing through

313
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:22,879
your network so for instance they be

314
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,480
able to see oh yeah there's an IPSec VPN

315
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,759
between this IP and this IP maybe that's

316
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,869
interesting maybe I need to do a little

317
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,869
more reconnaissance on that

318
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,470
unfortunately the research for this

319
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:40,069
particular paper was not based on open

320
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:45,579
data and so I don't know if I'm gonna

321
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:48,889
get any actual data from the researchers

322
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:50,559
to validate this or not makes it a

323
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:56,269
little bit hard when it's a closed

324
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:59,199
system so some of the solutions so not

325
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,199
everything is all bad

326
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:07,129
so the BGP hijacks becoming mainstream

327
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:08,720
this year has increased our PKI adoption

328
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,539
especially with authoritative dns

329
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,750
servers so amazon signed their routes

330
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:20,359
after the roads were hijacked booked two

331
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,949
weeks later it's a good step also ixps

332
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,760
have been automating their filtering

333
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,850
based on IRR so I was a little bit

334
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,379
horrified to find out that there is

335
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:33,408
internet exchanges out there that have a

336
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,200
route server that basically this a/s is

337
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,250
allowed to peer in and this lis is

338
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,710
allowed to peer in and there's no

339
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,559
filtering lists so anyone could say 'oh

340
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,010
yeah google's over here 88's over here

341
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,029
and people would accept it because the

342
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,899
route server would send it through

343
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:49,899
that's crazy

344
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,809
locally at M bik's we've also enabled

345
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,840
automation to do two routes over

346
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,450
filtering we did that over Thanksgiving

347
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,639
weekend this year we're using a piece of

348
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,230
software called a rote server which is

349
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:15,940
some Python with a bunch of other stuff

350
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:18,630
all glued in nailed on whatever it uses

351
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,809
irr row projects which is the standard

352
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,660
it also uses Aaron who is origin a s so

353
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,190
if you have IP space that you have

354
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,910
control over one of the things you can

355
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,740
set is that this particular a s might

356
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,750
originate this or this other and you can

357
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,790
list a whole bunch of them in there

358
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,440
it's kind of a new field I don't think

359
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,220
it's been around forever because it's

360
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,830
not populated for a ton of IP space but

361
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,440
in terms of getting a route accepted and

362
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,149
having a local traffic go local it works

363
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,220
for this it doesn't work globally like

364
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,090
you know AT&T and Shaw where they appear

365
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,950
they don't use that they use IR only but

366
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,689
it at least helps with local and it can

367
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,200
kind of band-aid a thing for a day or

368
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:05,200
two the other thing that we filter based

369
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,870
on is also the rpki certificates that

370
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,130
the robos so if you publish a route that

371
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:15,580
says this slash 24 can come from this is

372
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:20,049
or this a s then we look at that the

373
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:22,740
same as a route object and if it fails

374
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:25,210
then we actually mark it as invalid too

375
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,049
so when we enable this route filtering

376
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:32,530
most of the irr objects existed already

377
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:34,299
and that's due to a lot of the up

378
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,540
streams having already created proxy

379
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:39,639
entries so sha does this for a lot of

380
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,700
there's not all the time

381
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,910
mts also does this for their customers

382
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,500
again maybe not all the time but less is

383
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,799
pretty good about this mostly because I

384
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,470
make him and then myself because I'm

385
00:19:50,799 --> 00:20:01,408
involved in my own ISP and a couple

386
00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:06,690
others yeah

387
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:06,690
so can we have any questions if time

388
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:36,879
what's wait wait we're gonna go with the

389
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:39,189
front row here first Jared sorry so the

390
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,620
questions about if if if it would work

391
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,169
with HTTP or not I guess is is basically

392
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,000
what I'm boiling it down to and so in

393
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,770
the case of the hijack of my ether

394
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,020
wallet calm there was a self-signed

395
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,210
certificate and so people just click

396
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,570
past that logged into a fake site and

397
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,179
gave out the credentials in the case of

398
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,240
like there's this China Telecom hijack

399
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,070
their stuff is still flowing through

400
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,159
them it's not flowing to a different end

401
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,250
point and so if there was weaknesses or

402
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:15,330
something in the HTTPS then maybe they

403
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,330
might be able to see something yeah

404
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,350
Jared

405
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,340
yeah basically that's the the best

406
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,280
solution ask for the regional ISPs and

407
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:52,120
the the tier ones and the i-x bees to

408
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,590
stock less because as a small guy you

409
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,699
know like there's there's people out

410
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,740
there that I only have a default route

411
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,630
you can't do anything with that you

412
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,880
can't do any sort of rpki filtering when

413
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:05,130
you only have one route and when you

414
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,780
expand that up to you know the people

415
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:10,030
like myself that are mostly single home

416
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,600
again there's it's not really a lot you

417
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,760
can do because you're just you know but

418
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,149
the the tier ones they definitely need

419
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,680
to be doing this and I know that that

420
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,300
job is putting pressure on them because

421
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,580
he works for for one of the tier ones

422
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:29,379
for an TT and also you know like the

423
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,919
tier twos and the aggregators and

424
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,150
whatnot

425
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,170
that's where is really really really

426
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,400
helpful and and that stuff has become

427
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,650
since I talked about this you know two

428
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,640
three four years ago it's become a lot

429
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:46,200
more accessible in in the routers and

430
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,200
stuff that people are actually using

431
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,460
yeah

432
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,770
these are all ipv4 hijacks but I mean

433
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,610
the same thing can happen on ipv6 too

434
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:03,240
and if you follow the BGP stream Twitter

435
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,479
account you'll see the occasional v6

436
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,220
hijack I don't know if there sometimes

437
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,380
it's just people changing providers or

438
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,510
things like that to you right so it's

439
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:20,680
hard to investigate them all really

440
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:23,820
seriously in the back yeah I think

441
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,820
that's you well maybe mid ways

442
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,759
so in the case of a lot of these hijacks

443
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,559
it was used to put up authoritative DNS

444
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,879
servers to respond with different

445
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:55,039
results

446
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:58,178
most of the hijacks were like that the

447
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,529
the China Telecom hijacks though were

448
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:02,659
like that's that's looking at traffic

449
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:04,220
that's not that's not hosting a

450
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:06,919
different end point for something that's

451
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:12,679
let's make this go through us and see

452
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:20,929
what we can see yeah yeah yeah exactly

453
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:44,480
I think times up the master questions

454
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:46,129
like super super super short I haven't

455
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,539
seen anything where people have gotten

456
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:51,709
certificates like through let's encrypt

457
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:54,889
or something as a result of this yet but

458
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,960
I think it could have been done in like

459
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:58,309
the example public the Amazon I think

460
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,330
they could have done that through let's

461
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:01,539
encrypt and it would have been more

462
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,539
effective

463
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,760
thanks for listening

464
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:12,760
[Applause]
