1
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:12,000
good morning and thank you very much for

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,330
the opportunity to be here today it's

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
it's a great honor I'm delighted to be

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,220
able to come and visit Japan I've never

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,810
been to Japan or Tokyo before and as

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,880
soon as my body is caught up with the

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,360
jetlag I intend to explore this

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,729
wonderful city and country as well I

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,189
will try and speak as slowly as I can

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,190
I'm afraid my Japanese isn't very good

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,050
it's in fact almost non-existent but I

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,500
will do my best to help the translators

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,959
today I've come here today to talk about

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,060
a book which I published about 18 months

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,040
ago which you can see on the slides

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,200
there called hacking the bomb and this

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,730
was my attempt to wrestle with what I

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,290
thought or I believed to be an

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,169
absolutely central problem in our world

20
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,790
the intersection of the ultimate weapon

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,560
and I don't need to tell people in in

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,780
this room and from this country of the

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,920
significance of nuclear weapons with the

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,769
whole suite of new and emerging

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,530
technologies under this label of cyber

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,659
and this struck me is one a fascinating

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,400
academic project but also hopefully

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,530
something that had considerable

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,159
implications for how we maintain and

30
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,540
secure a peaceful and stable world so

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,260
what I intend to do with the time

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,870
allocated to me today is to give you 11

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,580
takeaways from the book I really had

34
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,280
hoped this would be 10 because it sounds

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,289
better but it is 11 I couldn't squeeze

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,909
them together and hopefully this will

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,620
give you an idea of how I've tried to

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,229
map out this challenge and thought about

39
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,600
it I should also confess at the start

40
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,549
that I'm not a techie I'm a political

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,770
scientist or perhaps more correctly an

42
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,299
international relations scholar so

43
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,298
please forgive me for that to start with

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,250
but I'm also us I think it's fantastic

45
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,240
that in a forum such as this we can

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,680
combine people from different

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,839
backgrounds and I think many of the

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,330
issues that we look at today require

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,010
that cross discipline and people from

50
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,000
different backgrounds and to address

51
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:06,180
them so when I study looking at this

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,470
cyber nuclear challenge five or six

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,450
years ago and I was very lucky to have

54
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,959
some funding from the UK government to

55
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,530
do this a lot of questions seem to

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,499
abound

57
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,079
so could hackers break into nuclear

58
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:20,319
systems cause a launch or prevent these

59
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,620
systems from working

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,420
could they be spoofed electronically or

61
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,920
could operators and decision-makers be

62
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,170
tricked into making wrong and

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,390
potentially fatal decisions could

64
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,450
nuclear secrets be vulnerable to cyber

65
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,040
spies and perhaps even would-be

66
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,530
proliferators and in what ways might

67
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,510
certain attackers do this what exactly

68
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,849
does the threat look like and what is

69
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,310
vulnerable to in what ways and to whom

70
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,129
how much of the hype should we believe

71
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,019
how series should we be about this

72
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:51,909
challenge and of course finally what are

73
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,040
the best ways to manage their mitigate

74
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,439
some of the worst possible scenarios

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,720
that we could foresee and interestingly

76
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,000
it seemed to me that some 35 years after

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,430
this film that you can see on my slide

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,409
was came out in Hollywood wargames

79
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,500
starring a very young Matthew Broderick

80
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:11,019
and back in 1983 it seemed that perhaps

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,480
we had reached an era where hackers

82
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,269
perhaps not necessarily a teenager in

83
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,858
their bedroom in Seattle but hackers

84
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,590
could get into nuclear weapons and we

85
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:23,019
had to take this challenge seriously so

86
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,449
it seemed that as is often the case what

87
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,250
was happening in sci-fi generation ago

88
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:31,840
had almost become reality

89
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,489
today the first thing that really struck

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
me about as a political scientist

91
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:39,069
looking at this question was that the

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,228
word cyber is fundamentally contested it

93
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,750
is nebulous it is used by different

94
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:46,449
people organizations and countries to

95
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,699
mean very very different things this

96
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,620
often means that analysts or even policy

97
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,819
makers talk past each other when we use

98
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,349
this word for some cyber is actions and

99
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,478
I'm guessing this is a lot of people in

100
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,638
this room purely through the internet or

101
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,340
through networks for others it's bound

102
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,010
up with this comp for this concept of

103
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,299
information warfare for others still

104
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,328
it's something about the whole broader

105
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,069
age or period or epoch that we are

106
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,780
living in and this of course makes

107
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,539
understanding the challenge at its most

108
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,899
basic level let alone responding really

109
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:22,089
difficult also I think has and continues

110
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,299
to lead to hype and worst case scenario

111
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,460
thinking a good example of this and I

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,650
apologize for for picking on Donald

113
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,359
Trump it seems to be a a regular theme

114
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,638
of people these days but it's a good

115
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
example in 2016 in the presidential

116
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,220
election

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,440
debates with Hillary Clinton then

118
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,880
candidate Donald Trump kept referring to

119
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,890
doing this cyber better we have to we

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,380
have to do many things better cyber is

121
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,849
one of them and I think as I say Donald

122
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,920
Trump is by no means the only person to

123
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,900
do this but gives a good example of how

124
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,940
this word is being used in an

125
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,799
essentially meaningless way whether this

126
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,469
refers to cyber attack capabilities

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,150
Network defense information security or

128
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,800
something completely different really

129
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,390
isn't very clear and this is comes

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,660
across a lot in the debate from a

131
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,340
political science perspective so the way

132
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,740
that I tried to address this issue is

133
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,440
thinking of cyber or computer network

134
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,810
operations as two different things so

135
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,030
first of all comprising a particular set

136
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,370
of tools or capabilities or operations

137
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,049
many of which are new and as well as a

138
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,000
broader context within which these

139
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,180
operations capabilities and tools are

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,010
being used or are carried out so the

141
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,660
question then becomes not so much which

142
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,360
cyber technologies or what the cyber

143
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,770
technologies can do but rather how the

144
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,240
context alters the way that we

145
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,370
understand and interact with the world

146
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,320
and in this case how we think about and

147
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,750
understand nuclear weapons and the

148
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,219
politics that surround them and I think

149
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,600
because of this it often makes sense to

150
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,040
work backwards from a problem as a

151
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,229
scholar particularly as I say in the

152
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,900
social scientists rather than going in

153
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:54,159
straight away with a framework and this

154
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,780
actually was one of the things perhaps

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,880
not the most exciting bit of the

156
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,380
research that I did that was probably

157
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,860
the most fundamental to get my head

158
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,680
around this definition and conceptual

159
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,180
problem there is even a case although I

160
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
found this increasingly difficult when

161
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,110
cyber is in the title of a lot of my

162
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,880
presentations to get rid of the word

163
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,320
altogether and go back to some of that

164
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,229
language that many in this room will be

165
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,659
familiar with from the 1990s information

166
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:22,240
security information warfare network

167
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,790
security computer security etc etc often

168
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,090
much more precise and how it's being

169
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,580
used second key thing to point out from

170
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,150
the work cyber however we define it and

171
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,039
nuclear are different it's been quite

172
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,010
common I think over the past decade or

173
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,800
so to compare the two to try and

174
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,349
superimpose lessons or frameworks from

175
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,390
the nuclear arm and nuclear era on to

176
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:47,830
cyber that somehow this is the latest

177
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,270
technology that can summative

178
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,700
supplanted and therefore many of the

179
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,070
rules will remain the same but I think

180
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,150
this analogy while the questions that we

181
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,130
ask may be correct

182
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,020
the answers are often very different and

183
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,540
therefore the analogy is quite often

184
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,460
flawed again the major difference here

185
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,620
is clear the amount of damage you canyou

186
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,729
can cause and again I don't need to tell

187
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,890
people in this room how much damage

188
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,810
nuclear weapons can do but modern

189
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,099
nuclear weapons even a small nuclear

190
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,510
exchange would have vast with a

191
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,340
considerable and significant

192
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,890
consequences probably for everybody on

193
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,090
the planet in reality where we are now

194
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,330
and there may be others in this room

195
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:25,510
better in a better position to comment

196
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,580
than I but so far as I'm aware no one

197
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,870
has died of a cyber attack and the

198
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,700
impact would likely to be much more

199
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,040
temporary and perhaps and almost

200
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,690
certainly not as devastating so we're

201
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
often better thinking or a good way of

202
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,410
thinking about this is a difference

203
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,450
between weapons of mass destruction as

204
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,490
in nuclear and weapons of mass

205
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,849
disruption something that is far more

206
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,500
temporary often much more specialized

207
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,710
secret and often happening at the lower

208
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,730
end of the threat spectrum targets are

209
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,859
often likely to be different

210
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,380
sophisticated cyber attacks often have

211
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,670
to be very specialized whereas nuclear

212
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,640
weapons are broadly seen as being

213
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,620
largely indiscriminate transparency is

214
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,349
clearly important here nuclear weapons

215
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,910
are displayed you can count them they

216
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,560
are quantifiable you use them for

217
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,360
signaling and posturing in a whole host

218
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
of other things is much more difficult

219
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,960
in the cyber realm to demonstrate

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,880
capability or to show off what you have

221
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,979
moreover if you do show off what you

222
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,870
have those weapons or capabilities may

223
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,420
lose any value that they had to begin

224
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,860
with the other key point with this is

225
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,930
that the vast majority of what we think

226
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,000
of as cyber threats or cyber operations

227
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,260
actually happen right at the bottom end

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,960
of this spectrum and really have nothing

229
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,400
to do with nuclear weapons at all but

230
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,960
there is a tendency I think to conflate

231
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,209
these two and that often leads to hype

232
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,500
and bad policy third point cyber threats

233
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,720
are very diverse

234
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,580
there is no single cyber threat despite

235
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,860
the fact that the way the word is used

236
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,110
often seems to imply that might be the

237
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,000
case and we're far better thinking of a

238
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,710
cyber threats spectrum something that

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,960
ranges as you can see on the bottom of

240
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,570
the slide there over quite a wide range

241
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,640
of different activities at the bottom we

242
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,100
have general hacking nuisance cry

243
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,600
espionage denial-of-service and then

244
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,430
just at the top in a very small

245
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,860
component of this would be physical

246
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,540
attacks all those attacks or operations

247
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,029
seeking to cause damage or destruction

248
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,490
as far as I'm concerned warfare is quite

249
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,839
a problematic concept in term in the

250
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,670
cyber realm and will refer back to that

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,680
later and I don't think we've had and I

252
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,479
don't think we're likely to have cyber

253
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,790
warfare in the way that we've thought

254
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,829
about it in the past but a lot of these

255
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,630
different threats are often lumped

256
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,370
together and so when we're talking about

257
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,930
a certain type of threat it can often be

258
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,610
misinterpreted or seen through a

259
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,949
different lens and again this leads to

260
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,720
hype misunderstanding and perhaps

261
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,430
complicates responses such as in terms

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,079
of whether deterrence can work in this

263
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,920
realm which will come on to you a bit

264
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,599
later we can think of attackers in the

265
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,130
nuclear arm specifically it's trying to

266
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,980
do two things and this goes back to a

267
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,649
classic strategic studies way of looking

268
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,130
at problems as looking between

269
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:59,600
intentions and capabilities so various

270
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,339
actors in the Nick terrarium met may

271
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,700
seek to enable something so that is

272
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:06,680
causal launched exacerbate a crisis

273
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,660
cause problems that lead to need for use

274
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,180
in some way they may do this indirectly

275
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,709
or directly and I think it's most likely

276
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,239
that this is what this is something that

277
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,890
a non-state actor would seek to do I

278
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,089
can't see many reasons why a state actor

279
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,170
would want to exacerbate a crisis at

280
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,149
least it doesn't immediately come to

281
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,949
mind a state actor is probably much more

282
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,660
likely to seek to disable a system to

283
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,250
stop it from working whether it be an

284
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,899
air defense radar whether it be a

285
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:35,540
particular weapon system at command and

286
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:37,370
control node or something else States

287
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,349
again I think a more capable of

288
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,760
attacking systems directly they have the

289
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,290
time resources capability to do this

290
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,970
whereas non-state actors or cyber

291
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,670
terrorists leave if there really is such

292
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,910
a thing out there and more likely I

293
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,529
think to seek indirect measures of doing

294
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,779
this manipulating the information space

295
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,010
and finding other way other ways in I

296
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,390
think one of the reasons for this is

297
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,160
quite simply that for a terrorist group

298
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,839
there are often much easier ways of

299
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,760
causing they're causing damage or

300
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,070
achieving their objectives it's thinking

301
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,050
about cyber tools and capabilities as

302
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,510
just one part of a toolkit not

303
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:15,010
necessarily the only one that will

304
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,010
always be used

305
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,990
so there's a common perception I think

306
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,390
across the broader cyber community both

307
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,230
social science and hard sciences the air

308
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,029
gapping or network separation is it is a

309
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,589
way of defending things if you don't

310
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,180
connect if you don't connect systems to

311
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,460
the Internet if they are not linked into

312
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,579
broader unsecured networks than they are

313
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,680
if not invulnerable and then certainly

314
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,630
safe but I think this is slightly

315
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,099
misguided and in the nuclear-armed

316
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,420
wicked weekly I think there's a very

317
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,580
good example of how this might work

318
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,380
another good example of course is that

319
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,220
Stuxnet which was discovered in into in

320
00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:00,160
2010 entered an air-gap system in the

321
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,620
tans in Iran but another good example of

322
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,350
the problem of the idea of air gapping

323
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,910
or network gapping or separation at the

324
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,160
UK Trident submarines these are the

325
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,630
submarines the UK uses to house its

326
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,850
nuclear deterrent the Trident missile

327
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,529
inside the Vanguard submarine which

328
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,660
comprises the whole nuclear deterrent

329
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,550
for the UK so when I was doing research

330
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
for this book officials in the UK

331
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,300
Ministry of Defence and across

332
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,339
government constantly told me that this

333
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,109
system was absolutely fine it was

334
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,640
invulnerable hackers could not break

335
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,950
into these submarines they could not do

336
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,900
anything to the UK deterrent because of

337
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,490
course the submarines are on patrol

338
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,130
summer in the North Atlantic sitting in

339
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,589
a deep trench silent and no one knows

340
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,600
where they are well that's certainly

341
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,459
true but it forgets the fact that

342
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,900
somebody has to write the coding for

343
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,219
each part of that submarine all the

344
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,930
different systems on it whether it be

345
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,020
for the natural maintenance of the

346
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,390
submarine and its lifespan clean water

347
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,040
supplies somebody writes coding for the

348
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,630
missiles in this case that's somebody in

349
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,849
the United States probably at Lockheed

350
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,740
Martin not in the UK and of course the

351
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,980
warhead also relies on coding as well

352
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,770
these submarines go in to base to be

353
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,839
patched the operating system is upgraded

354
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,220
it is often plugged in potentially to

355
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,529
unsecured networks and it gives access

356
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,970
to many people while it's in port they

357
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,600
also receive a very small amount of

358
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,250
communications via via radio waves while

359
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,200
there while they're at sea and this is

360
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,350
potentially another way that you could

361
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,640
compromise submarines to the other

362
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,290
aspects of this of course is that you

363
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,100
don't necessarily in the UK case need

364
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,380
- cause the warhead aboard to explode to

365
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,000
achieve your aims it may simply be doing

366
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,279
something to the submarine that makes it

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,500
have to come back into port in the UK

368
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,360
case there are four identical submarines

369
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,949
if one fault or problem is caused on

370
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,870
that submarine it will raise questions

371
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:47,300
across the entire force of submarines

372
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,829
the UK will deploy and this would be a

373
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,569
massive problem for the United Kingdom

374
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,849
given that it relies on a policy of

375
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:55,040
continuous Patsy deterrence whereby one

376
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,980
of these submarines is always on patrol

377
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,060
again it's not it's not the easiest

378
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,769
thing to do to hack into these

379
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,300
submarines but I think getting away from

380
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:05,600
this idea that they are invulnerable is

381
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,829
really really important more broadly and

382
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,880
I've seen this from research they've

383
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,120
done in other parts of the world

384
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,800
including in Asia there's an increased

385
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,360
dependency across all parts of the

386
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,550
military establishment on commercial

387
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,910
off-the-shelf technology quite often

388
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,258
simply for reasons of economics and a

389
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,360
lot of software that is not built

390
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:26,089
in-house or is further and further away

391
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,709
from the actual user and more research

392
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,050
even suggests and I won't say which

393
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:31,310
country it is but that at least two

394
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,040
countries where I've spoken to people

395
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,989
rely on software and components not

396
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,849
built in that country for their nuclear

397
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,029
weapon systems and I think that's quite

398
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:45,440
an interesting and quite worrying

399
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:48,350
development so going back to the cyber

400
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,600
definitional challenge if we take it as

401
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,220
being a contextual thing and about this

402
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,680
latest information age and about the

403
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,569
system's upon which we rely then we also

404
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,489
have to accept that some cyber

405
00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:03,229
challenges in the nuclear-armed and more

406
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:04,790
broadly are inherent so it's not

407
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,519
necessarily that a hacker will break

408
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,959
into a particular weapons system but

409
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,910
that those weapon systems and the

410
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,189
systems we rely upon more broadly are

411
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,219
vulnerable simply because they contain

412
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:18,800
bugs various software errors and a whole

413
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,600
host of other things and this means that

414
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,040
in the nuclear arm the more complex

415
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,560
things get the more we rely on

416
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,420
complicated codes systems that interact

417
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,420
in ways that we sometimes can't foresee

418
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:32,029
that things could go wrong this is an

419
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,130
idea borrowed from sociology from

420
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,630
Charles Perrault called normal accidents

421
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,939
and we can perhaps expand this to think

422
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,880
about normal nuclear accidents theory

423
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:43,160
that is that in a cybereye x'd or

424
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,260
highly complex more digitized realm

425
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,560
things just may go wrong

426
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,370
without hackers being involved at all

427
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,439
and part of the reason part of the

428
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,970
problem here is that for many countries

429
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,430
there is a tension between keeping

430
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,650
nuclear weapons ready to go the

431
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,660
credibility of being able to use them so

432
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,069
that you can deter you can show your

433
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,319
adversary you are willing and able to

434
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,970
use nuclear weapons but at the same time

435
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,300
making sure that they are safe secure

436
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,470
and can never go off by accident

437
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,780
unfortunately for many states it's

438
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,730
towards the always side of this dilemma

439
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,680
they're always there being able to use

440
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,800
them and this I think exacerbates some

441
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,150
of the problems I've discussed another

442
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,000
way of looking at this and this came up

443
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:26,270
in the executive meeting yesterday that

444
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,770
I attended is 40 years ago we have

445
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,660
evidence of a number of problems that

446
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,120
happened at NORAD the North American

447
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,040
Aerospace Defense Command which monitors

448
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,230
potential incoming missile threats the

449
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,599
United States a whole host of problems

450
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,580
with their computers whereby a training

451
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,220
tape was loaded into the system a

452
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,870
circuit chip caught fire and this caused

453
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,270
all sorts of false alarms and problems

454
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,520
of the possibility of a massive Soviet

455
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,410
incoming attack now these were old

456
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,720
computers they were the big sort of like

457
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,850
cabinet computers it was the 8-inch

458
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,950
floppy disk it was this area it was old

459
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,150
stuff and actually that was a blessing

460
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,830
in disguise because that meant many

461
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,770
people could figure out what happened

462
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:07,220
what had gone wrong and diagnose the

463
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,839
problem quite quickly the worry today is

464
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,550
that we've moved from that those big

465
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,899
computers that where we can see the

466
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,760
physical components and what's gone

467
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,800
wrong to something that is far smaller

468
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,480
and is often far less easy to diagnose

469
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,970
and understand the problems that have

470
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,370
occurred and this I think I think that

471
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,130
the lessons from the 1980s are to be

472
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,329
careful how we go about this today I've

473
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,439
put up there Eric Schlosser's book

474
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,560
command and control which is about a

475
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,910
nuclear accident in the 1980 so I won't

476
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,260
give away the plot but it but it is an

477
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,990
excellent book if some of you haven't

478
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,730
read it so far the other aspect of this

479
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,620
of course is the more tightly you keep

480
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,920
nuclear systems coupled with warning

481
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,929
sensors so launch on alert launching

482
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,890
soon and quickly to ensure that they're

483
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,960
not you're not destroyed in a

484
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,030
pre-emptive attack exacerbates this

485
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,860
problem even more if you've got systems

486
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,510
that may interact in complex ways and

487
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,050
that you don't understand problems and

488
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,120
accidents

489
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,680
happen and in the nuclear rome of course

490
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,580
the nuclear weapons realm the

491
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,140
implications of this are enormous the

492
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,399
cause of this I think this is an

493
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,900
interesting one for many people in this

494
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,120
room who may be involved in developing

495
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,190
systems for companies and perhaps even

496
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,560
militaries it's worth thinking about

497
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,350
whether modernization and complexity and

498
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,270
further digitization of the systems used

499
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,459
for nuclear weapons and the sort of

500
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,900
broader nuclear enterprise should be

501
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,700
modernized and should become more

502
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,530
complex or whether we're better keeping

503
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,300
them simple such as those that were used

504
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:32,690
in the 1980s the other thing that struck

505
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,120
me with the whole cyber challenge is

506
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,520
that it's a fundamentally human thing

507
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,899
while we often focus on high

508
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,160
technologies hacking sophisticated

509
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,770
methods of gaining access to

510
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,760
informational systems much of this can

511
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,980
actually be traced back to us as humans

512
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,050
many humans or humans design and build

513
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,930
computer systems they write the coding

514
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,000
create the software enter data operate

515
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,520
the machines and make decisions based on

516
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,200
the information that they provide this

517
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,450
is as true for me sitting here with this

518
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,360
computer as it is for somebody who works

519
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,740
in a nuclear command and control center

520
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,449
humans are knowingly give away personal

521
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,300
information click on infected emails

522
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,370
download malware insert infected drives

523
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,560
into systems and are therefore often a

524
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,540
key way of bridging the air gap of

525
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,909
getting across sophisticated defenses

526
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,100
and even that separation between systems

527
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,590
as well humans are clearly a very

528
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,020
obvious target for would-be attacks it's

529
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,149
much easier to dupe a human or perhaps

530
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,160
even find a way of social engineering

531
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,500
than it is to get past or utilized

532
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,110
zero-day exploits or other ways of

533
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,820
getting in this whole idea of cyber

534
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,169
social engineering it is a really

535
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,730
interesting one I remember giving a

536
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,760
similar talk to this several years ago

537
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,050
in Canberra in Australia and as I was

538
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,720
doing it somebody in the audience said

539
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:53,750
they'd looked up nuclear nuclear missile

540
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,670
is on Facebook and found a group and it

541
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,590
was a group of US Minuteman missile is

542
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,720
the people in charge of the u.s. nuclear

543
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,600
weapons in in the Midwest had a Facebook

544
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,860
group to tell people what was going on

545
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,300
so I think it's just an example of how

546
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,310
information can be shared and

547
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,000
information can sometimes very easily be

548
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,139
given

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,390
this of course could be used by a

550
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,450
would-be attacker or somebody seeking to

551
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,640
compromise and those systems we are of

552
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,230
course potentially getting into an era

553
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,650
where computers might be able to begin

554
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,590
to think and with integration of

555
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,000
artificial intelligence we might see if

556
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,590
we see more and more automation in the

557
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,600
nuclear realm but ultimately at the

558
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:36,050
moment computers do what we tell them to

559
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:38,149
do so it may not be as sexy as Stuxnet

560
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,970
or causing a missile to launch or or

561
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,500
whatever else but the biggest challenge

562
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,760
in the cyber nuclear realm is is

563
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,320
espionage now this is not new any anyone

564
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,610
that seen a James Bond film will know

565
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,139
that nuclear espionage has been

566
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,199
something that in the plotlines of

567
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,660
Hollywood for years and even before 1945

568
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,880
as well but this challenge is clearly

569
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:03,170
changing in the digital era in the cyber

570
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,670
era in different ways so we have to

571
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,770
think about the security of both

572
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,230
operational secrets so how things will

573
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,629
be done the policies the doctrine the

574
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,580
things that you want to keep secret but

575
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,670
also the design of things as well it may

576
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,050
potentially be becoming easier to steal

577
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,510
blueprints and various intellectual

578
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,250
property of weapons to share this

579
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,860
quicker no longer do you have to sneak

580
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,110
in a camera or take out large amounts of

581
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,090
documents or copy by hand this can now

582
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,520
be done in different ways and indeed I

583
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,889
remember going to the United Kingdom

584
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,990
atomic weapons establishment many years

585
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,430
ago and to give a talk going in with a

586
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,660
USB Drive and they said there's

587
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,120
absolutely no way you can bring that in

588
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,580
you can't do this quite simply because

589
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,139
it would be so easy in theory to

590
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,980
download information onto that drive and

591
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,030
take it away the challenge is kind of

592
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,410
bifurcated between both hacking into

593
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,500
these systems and the information

594
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,480
security more broadly and again this

595
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,230
idea of an air gap or Network gap or

596
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,760
separation is not a panacea purely

597
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,210
because of the human aspect that comes

598
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,760
in to this whole idea of cyber nuclear

599
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,830
espionage is not new and go back to the

600
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,470
1980s and the Cuckoo's egg where a guy

601
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,720
called Clifford Stoll traced a an East

602
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,580
German hacker through the computers of

603
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,260
various laboratories in California and

604
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,540
across the United States but it's

605
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,890
expanded pretty exponentially since even

606
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,080
to the point where we're worried

607
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,750
or there is a concern about sort of

608
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,149
digital illicit nuclear trading within

609
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,640
this realm as well some people may be

610
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,590
familiar or be aware of the Pakistani

611
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,080
scientist AQ Khan who established a

612
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,439
nuclear smuggling network in the 1980s

613
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,290
and 1990s the worry here is that a cyber

614
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,080
AQ Khan will be far worse and far more

615
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:47,149
far more worrying this idea of

616
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,980
proliferation is merely only one of the

617
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,270
implications are of cyber nuclear

618
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,850
espionage and the importance of

619
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,740
protecting nuclear secrets and it could

620
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,870
be a precursor to sabotage I'll explain

621
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,760
about the Syrian nuclear program in a

622
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,649
minute Operation Olympic Games was

623
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,530
clearly falls onto this the the broader

624
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,910
program that led to Stuxnet but it but

625
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,860
again it can be it can be different

626
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,330
there are different implications for for

627
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,800
what you might do but that protection of

628
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,040
sensitive information whether it be

629
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,480
operational or design has become more

630
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,899
and more important I think in this

631
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:23,360
particular age so one of the major ID or

632
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,160
one of the big sort of ideas within

633
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,290
within the cyber nuclear challenges well

634
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,090
we can't deter it cyber accompli can't

635
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,680
deter hackers because we don't know who

636
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,139
they are we can't attribute etc etc

637
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,640
therefore ideas of deterrence that we

638
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,980
had in the past whether it be through

639
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,280
air power in the 1920s and 30s or

640
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,170
nuclear weapons in the 40s and 50s can't

641
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,000
work well I don't think that's quite

642
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,580
right I think deterrence can potentially

643
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,920
play a role in this before this

644
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,050
challenge but with the proviso that an

645
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,580
enormous amount of the response will not

646
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,370
be deterrence by denial it will be

647
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,820
things happening much more basic so

648
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,080
linked in with the idea that humans are

649
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,679
one of the key aspects of this challenge

650
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,210
is the fact that many attacks many

651
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,390
security breaches and many other things

652
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:11,300
probably could have been prevented or at

653
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,960
least mitigated through better cyber

654
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,970
hygiene and better practice training

655
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,520
enhanced defence and security and where

656
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,750
necessary law enforcement as well and so

657
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,460
again it's thinking about where the

658
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,710
problem is and the particular aspects to

659
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,600
it however if we look at this from a

660
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,430
strategic perspective it is at least

661
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,830
possible that some cyber operations

662
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,630
could be considered as acts of war maybe

663
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,790
not now but certainly in the future or

664
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,690
military operations and that deterrence

665
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,060
by punishment

666
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,010
could have a role to play but I think

667
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,409
the thing to remember here is that cyber

668
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,420
deterrence only may only apply in

669
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,460
certain circumstances and it's not

670
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,510
either/or or something that can be

671
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:53,090
graduated in 20 2013 the u.s. defense

672
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,700
Science Board published this very

673
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,260
influential report January 2013 the

674
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,000
influential report resilient military

675
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:03,530
systems and this talked a bit about the

676
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,760
nature of the cyber threat and also how

677
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,129
it could be deterred and it quite

678
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,129
explicitly linked a nuclear response to

679
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,600
a cyber attack so the idea that not just

680
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,290
a conventional but even a nuclear

681
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,969
response could be possible or or indeed

682
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,470
credible in this realm is not far away

683
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,080
from the policy debate and we saw that

684
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,360
kind of reflected again although not

685
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,689
explicitly in the Trump administration's

686
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,709
Nuclear Posture review last year I think

687
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,210
it's worth saying a quick thing about

688
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,340
attribution in this room again many

689
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,140
people will know more about attribution

690
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,090
and probably are involved in it at the

691
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,880
moment but it seems to me again this is

692
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,050
not a either/or but something that

693
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,060
depends on a number of different

694
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,010
variables notably the amount of time you

695
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,800
have the forensic capability you have

696
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,330
and perhaps also the political context

697
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,889
within which any attack takes place

698
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,820
although that has to be treated with

699
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,200
some caution deterrence can become

700
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,270
complicated when considering a

701
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,070
proportional response in this realm so

702
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,920
it's not necessarily that you would

703
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,480
respond in kind one particular cyber

704
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,340
attack being met by another type of

705
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,650
cyber attack they're probably much

706
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,060
better off thinking about the impact of

707
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,950
these attacks rather than the method

708
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,470
through which they were carried out

709
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,970
there's also some problematic idea of

710
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,830
probably some problems here about if you

711
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,480
were to try and respond whether you have

712
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,639
to have already breached certain systems

713
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,380
and therefore have essentially preempted

714
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,790
any attack that you may face

715
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,960
so this broadly sort of comes back to

716
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,330
the idea that threatening nuclear

717
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,730
retaliation to a cyberattack might seem

718
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,649
pretty overblown it is there in policy

719
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,450
documents but it's something that isn't

720
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,950
going to go away none of the

721
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,650
nuclear-armed state certainly the US

722
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,480
Russia China or the UK has explicitly

723
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,980
ruled out responding to a major cyber

724
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,620
attack or as we'll see in a minute

725
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,690
attack involving cyber with nuclear

726
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,429
weapons and ultimately any country that

727
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,380
is attacked in this way or the

728
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,540
or the attacker has to run the risk and

729
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,340
those nuclear capabilities may come into

730
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,930
play but the whole point about

731
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,310
deterrence here I think is that it's not

732
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,650
just one type it's deterrence by denial

733
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,450
those things at the top and it's

734
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:07,820
possibly deterrence by punishment in

735
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:09,890
certain circumstances so I think well I

736
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,710
wouldn't want to be too sanguine about

737
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:16,130
this most cyber operations or attacks or

738
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,570
hacking it's probably manner in the

739
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,570
nuclear arm it's probably fairly

740
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,620
manageable during times of peace

741
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,179
notwithstanding those points I mentioned

742
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,610
about weapons that can be used very

743
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,800
quickly but are probably a lot more

744
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,360
risky and worrying during any sort of

745
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,190
crisis because of time pressures

746
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,320
perceive vulnerabilities and certainties

747
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:35,120
and a whole host of other things as well

748
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,669
and this could happen in a couple of

749
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,500
different ways so state actors I think

750
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,290
would seek to disable an opponent's key

751
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,030
systems before military operations can

752
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,430
begin seeking to prepare the battlefield

753
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,740
this is fairly explicit in both US and

754
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:51,380
Chinese policy for any hostilities in

755
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,390
this particular region this leads to

756
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,770
greater uncertainty pressures for

757
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,090
pre-emptive attack they'll preemptive

758
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,160
strikes and this fears of

759
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,840
use-it-or-lose-it if you don't order

760
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,920
firing you may not be able to because it

761
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,050
could be compromised because of the

762
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,490
uncertainty there's also the problem

763
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,590
that terrorists or other non-state

764
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,690
actors or third parties might seek to

765
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,639
interfere in various ways spoofing

766
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,620
systems conducting false flag attacks

767
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,270
flooding the battlefield with

768
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,550
misinformation intending to cause the

769
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,110
crisis to escalate and the two quite

770
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,870
good examples of this so at the top

771
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,550
there this is a picture of a tweet after

772
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,889
the Israeli Defense Forces Twitter

773
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:29,389
account was hacked and this was back in

774
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:31,130
July 2014 the hackers here simply posted

775
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,080
possible nuclear leak in the region

776
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,570
after two rockets hit Dimona nuclear

777
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,669
facility now it's fairly easy for

778
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:40,040
Israeli policymakers and military

779
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,290
officials to see that this was a hoax

780
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,870
that they had been hacked and could be

781
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,070
fairly quickly rectified but imagine if

782
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,199
this had happened in the middle of a

783
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,639
crisis or a middle of a beginning of

784
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,040
warfare or something else when time

785
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,390
pressures are there when communications

786
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,430
are down it's more difficult to gain

787
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,620
full situational awareness something as

788
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,600
simple as it as hacking into Twitter and

789
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,479
or even stealing a password can be very

790
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,330
influential and the second example and I

791
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,120
mentioned it slightly

792
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,949
that in 2007 it's believed that Israel

793
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,070
managed to hack into Syrian air defense

794
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,810
systems to essentially turn off the

795
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,960
sensors and fly over and bomb a

796
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:19,560
suspected nuclear facility

797
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,720
al Cuba you could liken this to in

798
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,700
Hollywood films where burglars

799
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,350
enter a building and find some way of

800
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,370
making the cameras go blank so they can

801
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,709
can walk straight through it's

802
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,780
essentially an same concept we don't

803
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,490
know exactly how the Israelis got into

804
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,590
this system but it's likely that it was

805
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,970
hacked in in some way before and it

806
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,030
gives you an idea here of how you may

807
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:41,160
compromise early warning and again sort

808
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,740
of if we expand upon that how that may

809
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,180
work in a crisis and again just to

810
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,790
reiterate the reliance of modern

811
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,370
militaries on increasingly complex and

812
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:55,590
computerized communications not least

813
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:58,139
between space and and command nodes on

814
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,429
the ground is creating I think more

815
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,010
problems and more dangers and more

816
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:04,200
potential things to go wrong it suggests

817
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,760
to me not least in this region but also

818
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,740
in other parts of the world that what we

819
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,230
think we know about nuclear crises and

820
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,120
escalation signaling may need to be

821
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,950
reassessed in light of this new context

822
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:20,850
and some of the new problems and that we

823
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:23,400
may face point 10 viewing cyber in this

824
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,830
nuclear world I think is quite unhelpful

825
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,620
I don't think we are at we will ever see

826
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,419
a pure cyber war whereas if you'll

827
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,500
forgive the terminology James Lewis says

828
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:37,080
a geek versus geek on a digital

829
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,110
battlefield and I think this temptation

830
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,600
to view or cyber threats or cyber in

831
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,250
isolation as a separate domain it is

832
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,530
quite problematic it may make sense for

833
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,560
administrative purposes and in reality

834
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:51,450
becomes much more blurred well clearly

835
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,240
cyber operations may be used on their

836
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,240
own for low-level low-level gains or

837
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,560
low-level policy or or even by non-state

838
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,850
actors it seems more likely to me that

839
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,889
they'll be used in conjunction with

840
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,600
other forms of military force in warfare

841
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,220
why would you simply use a cyber

842
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,590
capability when you could use that

843
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,480
alongside your kinetic capabilities it's

844
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,790
thinking about this again as just one

845
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,860
tool in a toolbox rather than the only

846
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,600
tool just because it's new

847
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,459
but it also means again that we need to

848
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,379
rethink how these how the integration

849
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,000
between these different forces are if it

850
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,909
is that cyber will be used to go after

851
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,529
communication links early warning

852
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:29,700
command and control assets then we need

853
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:32,669
to think about how that is going to

854
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,799
impact future warfare as well at the

855
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:36,659
strategic nuclear level I think we need

856
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,730
to think more broadly as well and

857
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,740
perhaps see this cyber challenge as one

858
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:44,519
component of a new suite of advanced

859
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:48,090
non-nuclear or strategic weaponry a new

860
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,769
suite of capabilities that are different

861
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,678
I think from traditional military force

862
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,539
tanks aircraft and getting closer and

863
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,639
closer to nuclear weapons both in terms

864
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,110
of capability destruction but

865
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,299
particularly in terms of the roles and

866
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,379
they can carry out and what we've

867
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:06,389
essentially seen is a percolation of the

868
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,880
technologies of the revolution in

869
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,709
military affairs from the 1990s have now

870
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,470
come up to this strategic nuclear level

871
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,519
so we see ever and then again something

872
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,110
that's that it shouldn't be lost on

873
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:17,760
people in this country increasingly

874
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,740
capable and increasing reliance on

875
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,559
ballistic missile defenses as a means of

876
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,659
protection various precision strike

877
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,629
weapons whether it be anti space under

878
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,669
the sea or against against targets on

879
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,440
land a greater incorporation of

880
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:33,389
artificial intelligence which is helping

881
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,919
with sensing monitoring and targeting

882
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:36,959
and a whole host of other things and

883
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,570
other exotic capabilities that we can

884
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,120
think of so if we put cyber into this

885
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,500
broader group we can begin to see a

886
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,120
whole suite of technologies that

887
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,700
challenge the way that we think about

888
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,979
nuclear weapons again it's not thinking

889
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,600
of cyber as one thing alone but it's

890
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,330
part perhaps of a broader suite of

891
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,500
things that are changing the way we do

892
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,510
warfare and in this case nuclear

893
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,549
strategy as well final point the what I

894
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,899
think we are beginning to see and I

895
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:05,340
think is increasingly worrying and this

896
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:09,418
is perhaps only after over the last

897
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,600
decade it's an emerging norm of using

898
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:14,880
cyber computer network operations to

899
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,219
target nuclear and missile forces this

900
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,570
is primarily happening it's something

901
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,700
primarily being done by the United

902
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,649
States but I think we'll also begin to

903
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,799
spread to others as well so the obvious

904
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:27,959
example of this is Stuxnet back in 2010

905
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:30,160
but it also seems fairly likely that I

906
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,380
think it was about two years ago

907
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,000
an example of this that the United

908
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,280
States is also perhaps with allies

909
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,230
alongside is also utilizing this

910
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,780
approach against other targets - namely

911
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,580
North Korea a couple of years ago there

912
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,280
were lots of reports of a failed North

913
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,389
Korean missile test and this very

914
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,760
quickly things in the New York Times

915
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,770
were very quickly linked to whoa hang on

916
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,750
has it been hacked has is this a

917
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,330
deliberate sabotage by the United States

918
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,919
and its allies the truth is we don't

919
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,600
know missiles go wrong they are

920
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,690
complicated to build you have to test

921
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,799
them but it plants the idea that this

922
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,690
may be happening and it's almost

923
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,109
certainly something I believe that

924
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,460
certain states are trying to do this is

925
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:11,168
actually starting to come out in US

926
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,530
policy documents and this was general

927
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:16,839
james Cartwright former former US

928
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,720
government official said this I think

929
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,580
this was five or six years ago and what

930
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,770
we're beginning to see is cyber attack

931
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,690
capabilities becoming part of both a

932
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,759
full spectrum missile defense mission

933
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,740
and also the Global Strike mission as

934
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,179
well the Global Strike mission was the

935
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,009
ability to hit anywhere in the world

936
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,440
inside an hour with conventionally armed

937
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,750
missiles well this is now not just with

938
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,639
inside an hour but also inside 300

939
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:43,210
milliseconds that cyber is part of it

940
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:46,030
but it's also part of the idea of of

941
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,530
left of launch so kinetic missile

942
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,540
defenses such as that are deployed in

943
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,460
this country and in this region would be

944
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,469
right of launch that you're utilized

945
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,929
after a missile has been fired or after

946
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:57,430
a threat materializes left of launch is

947
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,470
the idea that you stop that threat

948
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,779
materializing before through new ways

949
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,970
such as cyber so this is becoming

950
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,740
gradually more explicit in US policy

951
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,169
documents that there is a move towards

952
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,990
pre-emptive use of cyber and other

953
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:14,650
capabilities against nuclear and missile

954
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,270
systems why is this a problem because it

955
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,520
creates a precedent there's a real

956
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,650
considerable worry in both Russia and

957
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,180
China about what this might mean in

958
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,950
terms of their own forces it's much

959
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,330
harder to see these capabilities of

960
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,669
course they aren't tangible in the way

961
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:30,250
that a kinetic missile defense system is

962
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:32,109
and this creates uncertainty it also

963
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,150
creates a norm and the possibility that

964
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,310
other states will follow suit something

965
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,650
that I believe would make us all rather

966
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,089
less secure rather than more and there's

967
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,310
an idea going around that all of these

968
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:43,910
technologies but particularly the idea

969
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,308
of using cyber print

970
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,538
against an adversary systems is moving

971
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:49,940
us away from mutually assured

972
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:52,099
destruction to mutually unassured

973
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:57,309
destruction may not be there yet but we

974
00:35:52,099 --> 00:36:01,160
certainly may be going towards it so

975
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:03,260
conclusion recommendations I think the

976
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,149
place to start here is with the quote on

977
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,180
the right hand side and this is from

978
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,369
eminent scientist Carl Sagan and I think

979
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,868
this really captures and probably where

980
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:14,299
we are today perhaps not so much in this

981
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,579
room but certainly within society that

982
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:18,589
it and he said it's suicidal to create a

983
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:20,599
society dependent on science and

984
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:22,339
technology and which hardly anybody

985
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,020
knows anything about the science and

986
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:27,288
technology I think that's increasingly

987
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,000
true a generation ago people could

988
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,859
understand most of the things they

989
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,210
engage with whether it's your car or

990
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:35,538
whether it's various other aspects of

991
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:37,160
your life today as sociologists or even

992
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:38,780
Marxist would say we're getting further

993
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,368
and further away from technology and

994
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,349
understanding it and that relationship

995
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,780
is very important not least I would

996
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:47,569
argue in this nuclear realm go back to

997
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,069
that analogy of NORAD in the 1980s and

998
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:51,799
the big computers and the 8-inch floppy

999
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:54,980
disks and where we are today with much

1000
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:57,288
more networked complex and systems but a

1001
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,779
few ideas of where we go in the future

1002
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:01,549
so probably the most important thing

1003
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:04,279
from a political scientist perspective

1004
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:06,259
it's some sort of agreement on the

1005
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:08,599
language that we use the semantics of

1006
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,190
cyber and the nature of the threat of

1007
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,430
being clear what we mean when we're

1008
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,020
talking about these issues we also need

1009
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,788
to be clear again and I'm sure I'm

1010
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,920
preaching to the converted to many in

1011
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:21,619
this room that a considerable amount of

1012
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,150
cyber threats or cyber challenges could

1013
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,829
be ameliorated through better cyber

1014
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,750
hygiene and good practice this would

1015
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:28,970
probably prevent many things happening

1016
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,730
in the first place and maybe dissuade

1017
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,140
attackers from even getting involved but

1018
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,319
this reckless has to recognize the

1019
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,460
central role played by humans I believe

1020
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,808
there's a strong need for different

1021
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,309
communities to speak to each other on

1022
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,660
this issue which is why I'm one of the

1023
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:43,609
reasons I'm delighted to be here today

1024
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,410
to speak to people from a slightly

1025
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,150
different background to my own these

1026
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,129
problems that we're facing whether it

1027
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,900
being cyber threats to particular

1028
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,369
companies or looking at it in a more

1029
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,799
conceptual lens or three or more

1030
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,210
conceptual lens like I am requires

1031
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:57,290
people with different viewpoints

1032
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,910
different

1033
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,080
skill sets and different understandings

1034
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,730
of the problem that's the only way that

1035
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,220
we get roundness and I think it may mean

1036
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,690
we need different views different people

1037
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,899
and different groups of people to

1038
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:10,130
address this I think it's probably a

1039
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,170
good idea to train and deploy

1040
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,510
specialists computer of security

1041
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:16,700
specialists cyber specialists at nuclear

1042
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,110
facilities and conduct regular outside

1043
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,950
red teaming I know that's I think that's

1044
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,200
something there's actually probably

1045
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,669
going on on here in terms of red teaming

1046
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,350
this is something the military does a

1047
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,760
bit I don't know how much it happens in

1048
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,380
the nuclear realm but it strikes me as

1049
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,450
being a very obvious and good thing to

1050
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,670
do there's ideas about establishing

1051
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,350
early warning centers and and and links

1052
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,630
between countries so we can share threat

1053
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,339
data particularly if we believe that the

1054
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,410
greatest threat is non-state actors and

1055
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,980
the exacerbation of a crisis or causing

1056
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,660
a launch

1057
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,070
well let's share data let's share

1058
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,250
insights that share best practice

1059
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,380
between ourselves the idea that we could

1060
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,390
establish certain norms or moratorium I

1061
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,250
said in the previous slide we have the

1062
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,319
establishment of this idea of hacking

1063
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,420
the bomb of using cyber capabilities

1064
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,070
preemptively well if we all believe this

1065
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,750
is a bad thing then we should get

1066
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,940
together and make sure it doesn't happen

1067
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,620
can we find something to agree on that

1068
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,050
would benefit all of us that would make

1069
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,910
us all more safe and it may be that in

1070
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,070
this there is a role for non-nuclear

1071
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,379
States and allies as well such as such

1072
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,360
as Japan in pushing this agenda in

1073
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,770
trying to frame it and making the

1074
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,200
nuclear-armed States look at this in a

1075
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,400
different way and finally I think we

1076
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,930
need to think about whether these

1077
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,910
emerging technologies and cyber

1078
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,529
including as part of this need to be

1079
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,879
looked at in a different way this may

1080
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,410
mean including it in current

1081
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,480
international agreements and

1082
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,100
international frameworks but perhaps

1083
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,290
more likely it means building new

1084
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,870
frameworks much in the way the

1085
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:38,150
scientists and scholars in the 1940s and

1086
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,529
50s thought about the nuclear revolution

1087
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,750
and how we manage nuclear weapons

1088
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,810
perhaps we need this again to bring

1089
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:46,340
together an epistemic community of some

1090
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:48,170
social scientists but computer

1091
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,550
scientists and everybody else to think

1092
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,930
about what the rules of the road and

1093
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,020
what arms control and other measures

1094
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,100
might look like in this new world and

1095
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,660
finally and this is a bit of a bit of a

1096
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,029
sound buy unfortunately but I think it

1097
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,100
does capture things quite well in this

1098
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,960
new world in this new environment as we

1099
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,060
go further into a more complex cyber

1100
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,100
nuclear future we should really think

1101
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,350
about keeping nuclear weapons as simple

1102
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,670
as possible not making them complex for

1103
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,650
the sake of it

1104
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,329
keeping them separate from other other

1105
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,130
systems other military capabilities

1106
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:19,010
including perhaps warning systems as

1107
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:21,049
well and as secure as possible of not

1108
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,670
being tempted towards wanting to push

1109
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:25,849
towards the being able to use at the

1110
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,650
expense of security and safety that's

1111
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:28,910
that's me done thank you very much for

1112
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,200
listening and I look forward to any

1113
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,200
questions you may have thank you
