1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:14,680
hi guys I'm yo Ichikawa from Japan so

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,310
actually I can talk Japanese here but

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:27,040
for part of future I will talk I will

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:28,570
use English in this torque so so I'd

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,910
like to give you a brief introduction

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:36,550
myself I'm itchy this is correct screen

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,578
name i clap down with tokyo western city

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,608
our team mainly working on web and

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:46,300
forensic staff so we took away stands

10
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:49,359
also organized of to CTF took a western

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,410
city AK and the color CDF as you can see

12
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,839
coral CTF is in this conference coral

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,440
city a employed non-standard city of

14
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:01,839
formats called bullseye in bullseye we

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,420
operate accuracy of submitted exploits

16
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:07,810
and exploit with higher accuracy will

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,390
get higher points actually this this

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,340
topic is not rated about this talk is

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:19,360
just just interaction and I developed

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:22,900
coral engine or beautify system you know

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:28,180
Cobra CTF is now running on contests

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,850
venue that's why I'm I'm super Tyrus is

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:35,290
from Qantas areas Soviet as issue

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,929
interesting okay and also total CTF is

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,670
held by two cousins I altered some

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,750
challenges in tokyo's and CTF and

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,150
maintain infrastructure for the CTF and

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,830
2000 CTF is pre-qualifying event for a

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,210
cholera CTF and Cobra CTA is also

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,050
pre-qualifying event for Tekken City

31
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,780
finals

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:01,810
next year ok so before getting into my

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:07,530
talk I'd like to ask you if we can point

34
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:13,030
out the probability in this code so I

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:14,590
think no one can point out this code

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,420
SAVE structured data

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,020
just bring secret being usually

38
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:24,040
contourable terrors looks a bit stay

39
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,730
but actually this code is Bernabe verbal

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,910
in some points of course you cannot get

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:34,359
a shell in this code unless some there

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:39,760
they exist in : but how about data

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,160
reeking like side channel attack at this

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,350
picture is piranhas owners it is about

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,690
power analysis of course I will not talk

46
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:52,750
about power analysis attack everything

47
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,300
will be done in so pure land so what was

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,880
such an attack

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,000
ordinary exploits like LC e and past

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,350
robust all will achieve attack directly

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,600
but such an attack

52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:11,680
completely indirect it reeks sensitive

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,359
data from side effects for examples spec

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,210
to abused CPUs out of order execution

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,600
for increasing speed for execution

56
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:28,810
for example and specs specter uses cash

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,700
just timing and and there are no

58
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,040
permission checking for others when out

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,950
all out of order execution perform it

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,829
inspector also cross fight such DC uses

61
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,480
unprotect attributes of JavaScript and

62
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,180
padding work all this is in crypto

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,630
context planning planning error tells

64
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:54,390
spring text so this guy they are

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,390
recovering information from side effects

66
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:06,359
so what is the target aside from the

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:08,590
attack Oh CPU spec so meltdown and some

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,570
content out there like cross-site

69
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,570
scripting auditor in Google Chrome

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:21,070
crypto in crypto padding Oracle yeah

71
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,719
some sites on attack out there was a

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,990
hardware idea but I will not talk about

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,990
it

74
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,770
so about content auditors

75
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,700
so content auditor means project users

76
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,210
from some

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,440
Marsha's attempt for example cross-site

78
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,859
scripting order

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,040
Brock's reacted access payrolls from

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,360
attackers and what a Web Application

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,490
Firewall I will block from attackers

82
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,690
Martius requests also answered by a

83
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,810
software as well so content orders know

84
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:02,710
the content to be audited because they

85
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,440
should check the content content orders

86
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:10,539
sometimes have a variation system like a

87
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:15,969
script iteration system so side showing

88
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:19,690
attack against content order is

89
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,820
interesting for example cross-site

90
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,330
search is triggering false positive for

91
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,920
cross-site scripting ordering Chrome for

92
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,719
a brief introduction for across size

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:35,770
search using cross access auditor lyrics

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,240
XSS will be detected and blocked this is

95
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,659
a future with cross-site scripting

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:46,060
auditor and the attack abuses this

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,850
behavior like cross-site scripting

98
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,370
auditor will block the same contents in

99
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:55,900
query parameters included in the

100
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:58,300
response body like script bar secret one

101
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,650
two three four is included in retinol

102
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:06,010
body so you can iterate every bar use

103
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,349
and content order fires you can find

104
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:13,870
that response body contains this bar you

105
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:19,390
so let's call this kind of attack order

106
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:27,100
based or go so how about antivirus

107
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:29,250
software so Huntress technologies is one

108
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,440
of the most common software we use today

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,530
right Ava's ESET Kaspersky security

110
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,170
revaruraa and basically

111
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,539
Australia's software protects users from

112
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,370
Marshalls attempts by auditing file

113
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,580
contents network traffic

114
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:50,919
nothing so let's think about this

115
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:56,380
auditing data secrets combined with user

116
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:58,990
input in this context user input means

117
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,830
just controllable data like user name

118
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,210
email and so on

119
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,250
sometimes this case happens like

120
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,789
database towards every information in

121
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:14,440
single file so in this case other users

122
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:16,449
information will be secret all it means

123
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,680
just checking the content of file like

124
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,490
aunt whales

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:27,940
so what if attacker could control

126
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:30,490
auditing data pottery like this one if

127
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,860
one tries all its data including user

128
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,340
input like I can trigger a false

129
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,860
positive intention arey so just checking

130
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,549
data compiled secret with user inputs

131
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,520
and a little file or not other chimeric

132
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,310
secret by changing user input like

133
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,710
alternating user input pottery sometimes

134
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,610
combined string can be regarded as

135
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:57,940
Martius contents so entreprise can be an

136
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:02,639
Oracle in this case since on trials has

137
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,639
various choices for various contents

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,880
viscri entire software is totally black

139
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:18,639
box we don't know when they work when

140
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,620
they will do how they detect Marya one

141
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,759
of the most common entrance object we

142
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,770
use today is Windows Defender Windows

143
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,889
Defender is installed on Windows

144
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,510
operating system by default which is the

145
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:38,370
most popular operating system so let's

146
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,370
dig more into Windows Defender

147
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:48,680
so in Windows Defender what content will

148
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,269
be detected marshes they have their own

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,120
my wrists and the game made it public

150
00:08:52,269 --> 00:09:00,350
but probably other vendors have similar

151
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:08,079
ones but no details published so we need

152
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:14,690
to analyze a bimanual window defender so

153
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:17,870
Brad post winter defender analysis after

154
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,700
some tries they running audit process on

155
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,860
fire axes on execution and if detected

156
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,190
Moishe's broke asses from user and not

157
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,910
apply to user and their own writers for

158
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:35,390
various contents like encoding base64

159
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:41,240
archive compressions and executables as

160
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:49,880
well so black box on writing is super

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:53,180
tiresome work so okay here I'd like to

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,800
show you example a demonstration how

163
00:09:53,180 --> 00:10:10,630
window defender will detect

164
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:10,630
DD text contents so here windows

165
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:45,670
so this is a curl this is called acre

166
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:48,930
acre is signature to test some algebra

167
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:53,380
software this guide is signature totally

168
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:56,849
not smart marshes and just just for

169
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:01,500
signature okay great

170
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,500
starts and

171
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:32,440
okay I just say this signature into a

172
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:36,910
cat dot text and when I try to read

173
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,640
there the window defender get angry that

174
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:51,339
because there is a girl signature which

175
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:55,569
is detected as Martius so okay yeah this

176
00:11:51,340 --> 00:12:10,140
takes a long time so just just back to

177
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:12,430
practice rice so as you can see

178
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,860
analyzing window defender is very

179
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,949
tiresome work so how to analyze window

180
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:23,920
defender efficiently yeah it's really

181
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:30,460
painful work so this is one solution

182
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:34,930
that MP CMD runs a directory it triggers

183
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:39,570
the entire engine directory but still

184
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:42,489
some issues are there there is

185
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:46,600
unexpected behavior window defender like

186
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,790
a timing issue and neutralization and we

187
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,900
have to regenerate payrolls

188
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:56,140
bunch of times of course no debugging

189
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:59,860
information so it is its rate how to

190
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:06,220
hard to know why one is detected or not

191
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:11,760
detected so I try to find any useful

192
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:14,530
tools and the very there are good news

193
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:20,650
actually when the defender is ported to

194
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:23,620
Linux this starts on Monday from Google

195
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,590
projector oh poor poor its window defend

196
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,440
the engine to reacts actually theory

197
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,140
everything MP engine dot DL which is

198
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,500
core engine of Windows Defender

199
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:39,230
execution and it enabled us to do try

200
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:45,220
and error and show us some useful debug

201
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:49,310
like this one I can see that base64 is

202
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:56,300
decoded and decoded one is also detected

203
00:13:49,310 --> 00:14:01,369
as a curse signature right so there are

204
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:05,979
some tips about these two actually you

205
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:12,290
can get PDB symbols firing order version

206
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:18,080
from from this research you can get PDB

207
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:21,740
symbols for some button in Windows

208
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,520
Defender which is MP a.m. - every top

209
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,140
eggsy which is a archive of everything

210
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:32,600
Windows core engine and signature files

211
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:34,939
and you can extract impinge on DL with a

212
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,620
cab extract command cabinet digital

213
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:44,140
cabinet archive and also debug features

214
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:52,280
can be enabled by adding debug flag and

215
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:53,990
it enables to trace API calls inside so

216
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,339
let's talk about window defender in

217
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:02,210
tanaris so we know defender signature

218
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:08,720
format is dot PDM is a bit weird it's

219
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:12,430
somehow encrypted but basically this is

220
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,400
just signature for Windows Defender and

221
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:20,650
in this case WD extracts which is a

222
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:24,709
useful tool to extract brilliant file

223
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:31,250
will be helpful so let's see the

224
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:36,230
contents decrypt it so this is just part

225
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:39,920
of a decrypted brilliant file you can

226
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:45,500
see interesting for interesting so

227
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:49,939
window defender uses Rewa rule is you

228
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,670
use some some some Halloween stuff I

229
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,180
don't know about yeah this guy win

230
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,550
window

231
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,430
defender uses custom Rua bytecode here

232
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,859
you can see some function symbols

233
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:08,719
Imperial API bah-bah-bah

234
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,580
and finally I found that there are a

235
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,120
signature name and signature definitions

236
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:17,510
here I introduced you a cur signature

237
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:22,430
this is the upper part is just a Kurtis

238
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:25,450
file this is named Windows Defender when

239
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,599
the the bottom one is a curse on the

240
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,460
robot

241
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:35,180
this is the string just I showed you

242
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:39,350
before and also I found some hundreds

243
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:43,300
for various file formats so for example

244
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:47,270
MP crypt I don't know about this format

245
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:51,680
LD ma this is really well known formats

246
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:57,199
and XV gzip LZ for something there are

247
00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:01,040
so many formats so just after white

248
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:05,240
works on our analysis actually this is

249
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,300
not a white box I found window defender

250
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:12,829
Hal jscript analyzer with Dom API

251
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:17,740
support it and not just parsing there

252
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:21,919
just also emulating so eg script called

253
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:25,099
evaluation the average the argument of

254
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,950
even function will be also audited so

255
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,469
basically you evaluate its equal

256
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:35,270
signature as a even functions argument

257
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:43,340
it will detect it so what happens if

258
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:47,450
combined then so here is attack to demo

259
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:49,639
applications this is just simple

260
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,360
application for POC this application is

261
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,210
not real world application so basically

262
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,209
this application store is controllable

263
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,580
area 1 and control area 2 which will be

264
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:06,779
given by get parameter or HTTP request

265
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:11,189
they will say potato which

266
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:15,599
this format of course user can't user

267
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:18,840
can't see this secret and there is

268
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:24,599
another API to check existence of this

269
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:30,988
structure of data and integrity so under

270
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:33,989
this condition how to read the secret so

271
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:38,879
let's think about building exploits so

272
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:43,889
we have Windows Defender emulator with

273
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:49,619
debug information and jscript evaluation

274
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:53,549
function also iterate arguments and how

275
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:58,408
about concatenating the part of a cur

276
00:18:53,549 --> 00:19:03,539
signature and some input like this in

277
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:10,349
this case if this function will be T is

278
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:13,408
detected as - the input is R because R

279
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:17,820
and a part of a cur signature will

280
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:27,179
consist a complete able signature and if

281
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:31,739
nothing detected input is not R so there

282
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:35,489
is some issues in a script engine each

283
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:39,090
statement will never be evaluated like

284
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:42,899
this one even the condition statement is

285
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:45,478
always true this evaluation part is not

286
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:51,658
evaluated and this statement is not

287
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:56,039
detected in this case object accessing

288
00:19:51,659 --> 00:20:00,659
will help you like this one so just

289
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:05,970
putting key and var you like a switch

290
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:12,559
statement you can build some kind of if

291
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,559
statement and pathi stops on new byte

292
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,370
some extra part of string contains new

293
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:28,720
bytes it will be result in syntax error

294
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:30,840
so how to deal with no bytes so I found

295
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,299
another featuring MP engine of tal

296
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:39,309
doesn't ask window defender they can

297
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:42,490
analyze HTML documents some HTML tags

298
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:46,529
will be a trigger for example script tag

299
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,450
and parser will not stop on new bytes of

300
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:54,370
course G script can access the element

301
00:20:49,450 --> 00:21:01,260
because J script engine has Dom API if

302
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:05,199
each their ha body tag and like this one

303
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:10,090
so in this case you can extract the data

304
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:13,570
from inside body tag and you can

305
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:22,629
combining secrets with some part of a go

306
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:26,460
signature now you can have Oracle so the

307
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:36,149
payload is here so basically this is

308
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:43,440
really naive solution and this index and

309
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:46,719
C will be iterated for 256 times and

310
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,320
window defender get angry if this bar

311
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:56,440
EOC is appropriate yeah but yeah it

312
00:21:50,320 --> 00:22:01,110
requests 250s time try for each index so

313
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:04,270
let's make them much more faster also

314
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:08,100
mastered main function is also available

315
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:12,970
so you can do binary search like this

316
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:15,070
so in this case the variable C is less

317
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,760
than input it will not it will be

318
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:22,689
detected if it's greater not you it will

319
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,539
not detect it think you can do binary

320
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:30,559
search

321
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:34,139
so now everything is ready so this is a

322
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,799
structure fast demo application control

323
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:43,019
for a year one two cigarettes and if we

324
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:47,639
put periods like this you can wreak the

325
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:55,079
secret by iterating you tasting errands

326
00:22:47,639 --> 00:23:00,139
so to get work oh it's enough just

327
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:00,139
accessing name Cree after quitting rush

328
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:05,908
it's a web server they spawned with

329
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:09,839
internal server error it it means that

330
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:14,879
content will be detected and if you can

331
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:19,428
see normal response it's not detected so

332
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:19,428
I'd like to show you demo application

333
00:23:33,050 --> 00:24:03,220
so this is just demo application and and

334
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:07,360
here is a POC code this is just

335
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:27,340
extracting secret parts by creating

336
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:33,320
times okay you can see this window so

337
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:36,230
just iterating time sometimes and some

338
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:41,210
signature is detected and after

339
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:43,280
repetition these parts this key secret

340
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:50,030
can be wreaked which is stored in secret

341
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:59,450
part which cannot be seen from user okay

342
00:24:50,030 --> 00:25:06,530
so like this right so here is pros and

343
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:09,680
cons about entire Scirocco so for pros I

344
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,800
think I can use this method binary even

345
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,160
attack that didn't doesn't know about

346
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:20,350
racket structure because it's enough

347
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,350
just putting part of Pyro's everywhere

348
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:28,340
about cons attack I need to put two

349
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:31,580
pieces of payrolls and only data between

350
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:35,030
payrolls will be rigged so be scary

351
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,689
attack account to wait outside or to two

352
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,690
part of data

353
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:47,690
so I try to search any other variants it

354
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,780
would be great if there is a way to read

355
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,290
previous boring data without two-part

356
00:25:50,780 --> 00:26:00,080
contouring but I couldn't find no POC so

357
00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:06,350
far okay so let's think about any other

358
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,949
big things so many applications are

359
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:12,500
saving user input with sensitive data

360
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:16,040
here is some examples so first

361
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,680
interpretation file actually I also do

362
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,320
some changes using this technique with

363
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:28,760
station file in Tokyo wasn't City or

364
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:33,889
2019 in PHP PHP store social system data

365
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:39,200
as single file but basically user cannot

366
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:43,210
see whole content of station file but

367
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:49,130
each user can control two part or

368
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:57,380
session data attacker can read the data

369
00:26:49,130 --> 00:27:02,180
between these parts and other big names

370
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:06,740
would be log file like the logo web

371
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:13,100
server a batch engine X I is actually I

372
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:19,220
found some issues in IRS I found I found

373
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:22,219
as I wrote a is is detected as malicious

374
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:26,480
if some marshals payrolls insight into

375
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:29,630
this actually I reported to Microsoft

376
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:35,480
but it's silent very fixed and no

377
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:41,300
response another victim will be database

378
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:47,290
and cache file for database file based

379
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,290
database like sqlite3 we victim

380
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,560
so untwist can be used to modify the

381
00:27:51,230 --> 00:28:00,260
file contents by using one of their

382
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:03,200
future neutralization window defender

383
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,810
will replace much Martius part by other

384
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,770
characters after they detect it like

385
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:12,200
this so in this case our evil acre part

386
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:16,490
between script tags is regarded as much

387
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,100
as dear and they will be replaced by

388
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:25,580
species for neutralization to protect

389
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:29,719
the user so I think an attacker can

390
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,939
delete content Patri even attacker

391
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:37,790
cannot break data there there might be

392
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:42,830
something to do so one method is wiping

393
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:46,460
out evidence actually attacker can read

394
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,980
part of log just putting fast pay road

395
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:54,380
before beginning attack and do Martius

396
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:58,730
attempts and final put second last part

397
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:03,170
of pay roads after attack so equal log

398
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:07,280
in this case a log will be like this so

399
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:09,140
you can see the arrow parts so window

400
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,710
defender will replace between script

401
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,360
tags

402
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:16,880
it means the log file will be like this

403
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:23,959
so basically attackers - attempts

404
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:30,070
completely delete it and another method

405
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,070
is undefined Wales as general services

406
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:38,440
because they're eating much marshes eat

407
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:41,990
marshes it's a must parts over

408
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,230
structural boundary boundary the

409
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:49,970
structure metadata will be destroyed

410
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:52,760
because it's replaced by species but if

411
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:55,700
two part we're not over the boundary it

412
00:29:52,760 --> 00:30:00,150
will not distract structure but still

413
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:04,640
attacker can override other areas data

414
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:09,740
so what encryption keys are there and

415
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:14,490
they replaced by new bytes or spaces

416
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:20,280
yeah it should be really interesting so

417
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:25,020
how about other enterprises so why is

418
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:31,020
total is really useful for doing such

419
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:35,520
job so I try to search which entire

420
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:40,050
support jscript emulator so you can put

421
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,080
these two payrolls just combining a part

422
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:45,780
of acre and our last character and not

423
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,820
to rate this character the upper will be

424
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:52,139
detected and under will be not be not

425
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,669
detected after it is testing full

426
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,700
inspires past

427
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:59,580
sorry India web Microsoft's and now

428
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:03,330
launched Wales actually you can see

429
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:09,540
trying to my girls enjoy us fired but

430
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:11,570
actually this is false positive so let's

431
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:17,550
do further testing

432
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:22,950
so which inspires support Dom API so

433
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:25,860
just putting these payrolls so after

434
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:28,100
these tests or a Microsoft passed yeah

435
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,100
that's why they are brandable to

436
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,100
antibiotic

437
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:39,939
so basically Windows Defender is too

438
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:39,940
smart

439
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:50,570
okay think about how to prevent this

440
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:53,450
attack in my Orlando pinyon no genic way

441
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:59,689
to patch out there because this is

442
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:02,960
standard behavior it's not Barnaby T of

443
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:07,700
course disabling auditory engine is one

444
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:13,249
way like chrome chromium excess auditor

445
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:15,169
is removed in 78 version but Microsoft

446
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:20,679
would not remove the engine because it

447
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:23,419
ruins window depended completely so

448
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,600
application developers should know about

449
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:30,070
this attack and not save secret with

450
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:33,859
controllable dealer yeah but remember

451
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:36,139
it's not develop a sports because under

452
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:46,699
unwise vendor should take care about

453
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:49,580
that ok so conclusions altered based

454
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,629
Sacco like cross-site search of course

455
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,779
entres Oracle is everywhere and

456
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:58,369
entreprise

457
00:32:53,779 --> 00:33:04,159
is one big example it will be in Oracle

458
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:06,980
if it has intelligent engine so Windows

459
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,460
Defender is to smarter than other on

460
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,710
spoils resulted in effective Oracle and

461
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:16,549
the more smaller engine will get more

462
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:20,720
goals so very I couldn't find smarter

463
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:23,690
ancient and window defender so unwise

464
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,879
behavior will be sometimes harmful not

465
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,580
only data leakage also General Services

466
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:34,998
and the partially division like a wiping

467
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:37,668
out evidence and this is biggest points

468
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:42,379
I'd like to show you do not store any

469
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:45,499
secret surrounded by user input or your

470
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:47,678
application will be probable to Antioch

471
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,679
Oh

472
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:58,410
okay so okay here's the end of my talk

473
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,409
any questions are welcome
