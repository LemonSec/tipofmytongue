1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:18,029
thank you konichiwa Koko Nikola

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,920
teresita's thank you for having me I

3
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,290
want to present some information on the

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,509
GD P R I'm sure everybody of you knows

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,369
about it the data protection law in

6
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:30,040
Europe and also give you some

7
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:33,149
information on the new Japanese data

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:41,620
protection law and also have a look on

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:44,129
international data protection laws so I

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,140
mainly want to focus on three different

11
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,809
issues this is the definition of

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,260
personal data personal information and

13
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,820
PII I think when talking about data

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,289
protection in an international

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:03,390
perspective it's difficult to know what

16
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:06,190
law requires what what information

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,680
because the terms are used differently

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,920
in all countries so I want to give some

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,050
shots information on that then I want to

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,210
give some information when the gdpr will

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,149
be applicable and also some information

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,550
when it will not be applicable so how

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,460
you can avoid to have their GDP our

24
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:27,520
applicability in Japan or in other

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,240
countries and at the end I want to give

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,720
some information on IT security as for

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,270
short words on me I'm a lawyer since

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,850
nearly ten years I'm advising in data

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,270
protection since I started working as a

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:47,949
lawyer and I started to advise on the

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:51,910
gdpr when the text was published and so

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:57,070
I'm happy to give some information on to

33
00:01:51,910 --> 00:02:01,270
you in Japan so let's take a short look

34
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:03,940
back to the 25th of May 2018 that gdpr

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,490
became applicable and if you read German

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,160
or European newspapers you thought the

37
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,560
world was going to end all business had

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,460
to close down because the new

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,350
perversions were impossible to comply to

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,010
if you wanted to look at for example the

41
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,109
America

42
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,329
and newspapers then use the awesome

43
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,430
science like this one from the Los

44
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,069
Angeles Times you simply couldn't read

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,260
it anymore because they were blocking

46
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,030
all European users from accessing the

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,269
website because they were afraid of the

48
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,060
GDP our other websites are now using

49
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:41,230
plain text versions for European users

50
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,829
and also for example that USA Today has

51
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,869
a European Union experience meaning no

52
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:50,650
pictures no advertisements are now

53
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,170
trekking and so on an international

54
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,269
level it's still unclear how to comply

55
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,988
with the GDP our what the regulations

56
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,269
are and chattering from the information

57
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,269
you could read on on newspapers you

58
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,340
could think the GDP our would harm

59
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,489
European businesses in no other country

60
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,810
in the world would follow but if we take

61
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:17,079
a look at other countries I just wrote

62
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,780
down some examples Korea is thinking

63
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,280
about updating the personal personal

64
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,889
information Protection Act

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,030
India is preparing a protection bill

66
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:30,190
China had a security law in 2017 which

67
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,040
also had some information on or some

68
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,829
guidelines on data protection and I

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,470
guess most notably in California the

70
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:42,099
California consumer Privacy Act may be

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,410
valid from 2020 and will we'll have a

72
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,488
strong new regulation for a Californian

73
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:52,389
companies so you could think the gdpr

74
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:55,389
may be started a movement or became will

75
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:58,569
become a success and looking at Japan

76
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:02,739
there were two new trade deals concluded

77
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:05,349
between Japan and the EU in January this

78
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,440
year it was the biggest trade agreement

79
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:10,089
concluded to date by the EU and this

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,069
trade agreement and not also had

81
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,769
regulations or information on on the

82
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,108
simple economic and strategic

83
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,120
partnerships but also clauses on labor

84
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,698
rights environmental protection

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,610
intellectual property and also a data

86
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:33,420
protection so on the 31st

87
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:36,120
on 23rd January 2019 both in Japan and

88
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,750
in European Union there was an adequacy

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,790
decision stating that each of the

90
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,770
countries of the areas have the same

91
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:49,950
level of protection and I want to go

92
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,440
into detail on these informations on

93
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,900
future and you might wonder how did

94
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,969
japan manage to get this adequacy

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,840
different decision based on the high GDP

96
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,600
our level

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,450
well of course by new data protection

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,570
laws by a pretty strong data protection

99
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:09,840
laws the first the act on the protection

100
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,290
of personal information a PPI which is

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,890
there are the basis for data protection

102
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:21,690
in Japan and you can compare it to the

103
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,190
GD P R and it has some further documents

104
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,980
like the cabinet position and the

105
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:30,080
enforcement rules which are also a valid

106
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:33,450
law for all companies active in Japan

107
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,930
these free provisions are applicable for

108
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,719
all Japanese companies while the third

109
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,730
at the fourth I wrote and here the

110
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,640
supplementary rules they are only

111
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:47,490
applicable in case personal data was

112
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,130
transferred from the you to Japan and

113
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,380
then these additional as implemented

114
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:57,480
rules will apply to Japanese companies

115
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,820
so first looking to the different

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,430
definitions of personal data personal

117
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,390
personal information and a quick view on

118
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:11,490
the PII there are many different terms

119
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:14,070
how types of data are described I wrote

120
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,810
down here just a few of the important

121
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:21,420
terms and I want to focus on three three

122
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,580
terms so it's personal data which we are

123
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,220
talking about in the EU personal

124
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,460
information which is used by the a PPI

125
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:35,040
and to have a look at the personally

126
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,810
identifiable data in the USA so when

127
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,900
looking at the definitions of these

128
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,080
three terms we can see that they are

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,419
nearly the same

130
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,310
definitions though the api's as any

131
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:49,609
information relating to a living

132
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,610
individual that GPR says all information

133
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,900
relating to an identified or

134
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,229
identifiable living natural person and

135
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,659
even the definition of PII here by the

136
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:02,330
NIST saying any information about an

137
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:04,310
individual maintained by an agency so

138
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,318
when looking at these definitions you

139
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:11,629
could think it's basically all the same

140
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:14,180
but it isn't why is that mostly because

141
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:17,259
of the interpretation or the definition

142
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,699
definition of absurd animus data or

143
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:24,229
personal information so if data is

144
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,789
sodomized if identifiable

145
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:30,080
characteristics are replaced by

146
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:32,960
identifiers then according to the GD P R

147
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,258
and as is my understanding although

148
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,378
according to the API this data is still

149
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:42,860
considered a personal data so even if

150
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:45,560
you have lists with some identifiers not

151
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,629
citing the name the GDP are considers

152
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,849
this personal information also

153
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:53,300
interrupted data is still considered

154
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:56,389
personal information and so the data

155
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,849
protection rules will apply and the

156
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:01,610
controller itself doesn't need to have

157
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:04,580
access to this data or to the

158
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:08,089
identifying information even if other

159
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:12,229
controller only has the key to identify

160
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:16,159
the person then still it is a considered

161
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:18,949
a personal data so looking at some some

162
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,889
examples I want to start with a pass no

163
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,770
I got it when I was here in Japan the

164
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:28,729
first time as over you not familiar with

165
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:33,348
a pass no it's an IC card and it helps

166
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:37,338
you to to use the metro to use cabs and

167
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,479
you can pay without without cash nearly

168
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:41,120
everywhere as though it's really

169
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,380
practical and you can get past Moe or

170
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,440
other IC cards without stating your name

171
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,360
you just have to pay a short amount and

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,020
then you will get the person at the

173
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,880
vending machine but it has a number

174
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,579
printed on it so of

175
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,240
every ozzie card has an individual

176
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:06,050
number but it is not directly directly

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,949
related to one special person and still

178
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:14,029
the gdpr considers this to be a person

179
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:17,589
little information and this is personal

180
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:21,199
data already and this is different in

181
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:24,769
regarding the term of a PII and the USA

182
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:26,240
so let's look at some more examples like

183
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,910
name address date of birth social

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,250
security number credit card number and

185
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,620
email address and not stating a name

186
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,649
Superman 42 for example at what might

187
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:41,000
come it's not my email address just as

188
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:42,829
an example in all countries or under all

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,050
definitions this would be a considered

190
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:51,769
personal data but if we look at IP

191
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:55,008
addresses device IDs especially

192
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:58,610
regarding IOT for example or online

193
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:02,649
identifiers location data under PII this

194
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:06,019
won't mostly be classified as PII

195
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,380
looking at personal information the term

196
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:11,720
in Japan we can say most of it will be

197
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,639
considered personal information even

198
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,550
things like device at least online

199
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,490
identifiers because the definition of

200
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,589
the Japanese data protection act is

201
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,310
really close to the APPI

202
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,870
still I put some brackets on it because

203
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,619
their discussion in the next year's will

204
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:34,880
show whether this all will be considered

205
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,790
personal data and looking at the GDP are

206
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,819
you know the answer already everything

207
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:46,189
of that is considered a personal data so

208
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:48,589
even I I P addresses device IDs all as

209
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:50,599
such a technical information and

210
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,970
information which is necessary on a

211
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,610
technical basis this is a considered

212
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:06,500
personal data and therefore the gdpr

213
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:08,940
will apply so next I want to talk about

214
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,820
the question when the

215
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,430
gdpr and although the API will apply in

216
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,530
in the different countries so in some

217
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,229
cases of course just because you are

218
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,329
processing personnel data in one country

219
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,780
doesn't mean you have to relate to the

220
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:28,050
gdpr and I want to present three

221
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:31,500
different cases so the first case is

222
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,050
pretty easy I just took the European and

223
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,770
Japanese flags as examples but these

224
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,630
basic provisions are you can use them

225
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,090
and apply them particular really

226
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:46,620
everywhere so if there was a data of

227
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,710
effect it has object who might be

228
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:53,370
located in the U or in Brazil or in

229
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:58,620
Japan and who or his data is processed

230
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:00,510
by a company in that country then of

231
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,780
course only the data protection laws of

232
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:08,430
these countries apply the next step will

233
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:10,439
be if the data is collected on by a

234
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,140
company in the same country as the data

235
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,540
subjects but afterwards the data is

236
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,460
transferred to another country this of

237
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,620
course happens many times just been

238
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:24,240
using US service providers then the

239
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,120
personal data will be transferred and

240
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,150
the third case I want to talk about is

241
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,970
when personal data by data subject is

242
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:38,430
collected in the directly from Japan or

243
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,580
also here directly from another country

244
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,630
like at the USA because this in this

245
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,540
case again other

246
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,510
requirements will apply looking at the

247
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:54,180
first case basically a collection of a

248
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:56,490
data subjects personal data by a entity

249
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,310
here located within the same country as

250
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,190
the data subject then that it has

251
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:08,160
objects and the entities local laws will

252
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:09,540
apply this is pretty easy and it's yeah

253
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,689
it would be more interesting to talk

254
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,530
about the two other impossibilities just

255
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:20,400
a one hint that the gdpr has some

256
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:22,680
special provisions which were just close

257
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,810
by the European Court of Justice

258
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,910
who's that that the territorial scope

259
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,099
might also be applicable if the foreign

260
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,850
country has an establishment in Europe

261
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,180
so if this establishment in Europe does

262
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,670
not process the data subjects personal

263
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,449
data the data might be processed

264
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,520
directly from Japan might be collected

265
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,920
and theyyou but directly transferred to

266
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,560
Japan and there was just some entity

267
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,120
year doing advertisement for example

268
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:57,119
then this might lead already to GDP our

269
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,970
applicability but this is a special case

270
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,480
and I want to talk about the the two

271
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:07,020
other more practical cases which for

272
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:12,180
every company are relevant on that daily

273
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:16,140
basis so this second possibility is that

274
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:19,650
data is collected of a data subject

275
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:22,770
within the a company located in the EU

276
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:27,420
is processing that data and afterwards

277
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:30,780
is transferring that data to food Japan

278
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,219
then we will need to take a look at two

279
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,900
steps the first step of course the

280
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,820
company located in the European Union

281
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,670
and needs to comply with the GDP are on

282
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,520
the second step also the transfer from

283
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:50,400
the EU entity to the entity in the third

284
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,250
country and needs to be covered by a GDP

285
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,850
are and such a third country transfers

286
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,580
the GDP our state's several rules it's

287
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,930
pretty much the same with a PPI I will

288
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:07,380
explain that afterwards the GPR

289
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:11,520
basically says that for full GPR

290
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:15,900
compliance the first entity in Europe

291
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:18,890
needs to needs to fulfill all of the GDP

292
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:23,010
ours requirements and this includes

293
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:26,640
appropriate safeguards so this adequacy

294
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:30,900
decision which took place on Japan this

295
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:33,390
is one of the adequate safeguards others

296
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,769
are the standard contractual clauses I'm

297
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,920
sure many of you heard about it already

298
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:41,319
or safe harbor many years ago and now

299
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,969
it's the privacy field for data

300
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:48,790
transfers to the US or binding corporate

301
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,910
rules are another possibility of these

302
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,738
appropriate safeguards to transfer

303
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,309
personal data from the European Union

304
00:15:53,739 --> 00:16:00,369
from an entity located in the EU to an

305
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:04,179
entity located in a third country for

306
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:06,579
example Japan and this of course applies

307
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,459
no matter whether the processing takes

308
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:12,099
place within a group or it takes place

309
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:16,420
just with service providers or with

310
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,869
other companies so the receiving entity

311
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,269
will be bound to the provisions of the

312
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:25,899
local laws as well of course a Japanese

313
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:31,420
company receiving data from Europe will

314
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:34,420
have to comply with a PPI but still

315
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,238
again in addition their appropriate

316
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,868
safeguards required by the EU or by the

317
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:42,879
GDP are also have to be complied with so

318
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:46,779
for example if standard contractual

319
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:50,139
clauses are committed between the two

320
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,509
entities then also they're receiving

321
00:16:50,139 --> 00:17:01,799
entity in Japan needs to fulfill these

322
00:16:52,509 --> 00:17:06,669
contractual bindings binding rules the

323
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:08,439
adequacy decision helps will help to not

324
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:11,380
to use standard convection clauses it

325
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,630
will make things easier I will go into

326
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,250
detail shortly

327
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:20,919
but looking into edge into Japan the API

328
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,589
also has some requirements on a third

329
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,500
country transfers and it basically

330
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:31,029
states that if the personal information

331
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:34,929
protection Commission has some adequate

332
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:37,870
safeguards for transferring data to one

333
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,940
country if it was decided that the other

334
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,580
country has equivalent standards then

335
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,779
the data can be transferred without a

336
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:49,330
further notice or you can do contractual

337
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:53,470
agreements between the Japanese and

338
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,720
and the entity receiving the data or

339
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,409
another possibility is to obsess obtain

340
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,690
consent from the data subject and this

341
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:05,080
also does my understanding it also

342
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,970
applies within a Japanese groups so for

343
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:13,449
example if you if you export data of

344
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,840
your employees from the Japanese entity

345
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:20,350
to an entity based in another country

346
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,658
then the APPI states that you need to

347
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:30,668
fulfill these further appropriate

348
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:34,090
safeguards so looking at the third case

349
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:36,580
now because when looking at the second

350
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,559
second case you might have thought it's

351
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,678
a bit difficult too many rules to comply

352
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,309
with so you will just directly collect

353
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,789
personal information from Japan and even

354
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:51,279
if the data subjects are located in on

355
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,769
an international level then if you

356
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,950
process and collect the data from Japan

357
00:18:53,769 --> 00:19:01,059
yeah you might not need to comply with

358
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:04,659
the GPR but unfortunately that isn't

359
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:06,399
true so when we look at the case of a

360
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:09,460
collection of a data subjects personal

361
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:13,889
data by any entity located in another

362
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,989
country then the data subject itself

363
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:18,850
speaking in a general area it doesn't

364
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,190
only have to be in the case in you and

365
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,709
Japan then the local laws of the

366
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:27,039
collecting entity of course I will apply

367
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,519
but most data protection laws also have

368
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,429
an extraterritorial scope so if you

369
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:36,869
collect data directly here from another

370
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:39,820
country then this might mean that the

371
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,738
legal obligations of the country where

372
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,029
you collect the data from will be fully

373
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:49,090
applicable and this is not only an idea

374
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:54,429
which the GDP are use this but it's also

375
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:58,809
an idea at the API uses and also the zzp

376
00:19:54,429 --> 00:20:01,790
pa pa in California so the CCPA also has

377
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:04,120
such extraterritorial scope so

378
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:07,730
if you are doing business in California

379
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:10,340
you also need to look at the CCPA to

380
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:20,360
ensure that you will be compliant with

381
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:25,070
that so I want to go into detail on the

382
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:29,659
question what the gdpr states on this

383
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:32,270
extraterritorial applicability so if you

384
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:37,250
are a Japanese company collecting the

385
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:39,320
data directly within the you of data

386
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,050
subjects located there and then there

387
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,800
are two possibilities when the full gdpr

388
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:48,590
will apply one possibility is that you

389
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:52,310
offer goods or services in the from

390
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:54,560
Japan or the other possibility is that

391
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,830
you are observing the behavior of a data

392
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,260
subjects located in the e so looking at

393
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,510
the first a possibility offering goods

394
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,610
or services in the EU this is for

395
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,550
example if you have a web shop and this

396
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:10,310
Web shop is also available in German in

397
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:15,889
French and Italian and payments can be

398
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:19,990
made in Euro then the GPR will apply for

399
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:24,040
all the data which is collected by the

400
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:27,680
data subjects within the you

401
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,260
the other possibility here is observing

402
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,870
the behavior of a data subjects located

403
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,990
in the EU this is basically a link to

404
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:39,139
every activity linked with behavioral

405
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,240
monitoring of data subjects so basically

406
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,150
if you use cookies if you use online

407
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,850
tracking advertisement a tracking on

408
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,730
your Japanese website and you have

409
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,699
visitors from the EU then the GDP our

410
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:56,870
expect you to comply with the GDP are

411
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:02,270
for all of the data you collect from the

412
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:04,820
EU so this is a pretty difficult task to

413
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,060
fulfill because of course it's hard to

414
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,179
to avoid that some European data

415
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,250
subjects might visit your website and

416
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,120
this observing the behavior of data

417
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,310
subjects located in the

418
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,360
might also be a problem regarding IT

419
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,520
security so if you do intelligence if

420
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,610
you do a scanning of possible threats

421
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,330
then of course you might collect a

422
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,429
personal data just to check on possible

423
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,770
threats but still if you are collecting

424
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,960
that data outside of Europe then this

425
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:42,470
might mean that the gdpr will be

426
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:45,390
applicable for that the gdpr has further

427
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:50,160
provisions in case this extraterritorial

428
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,930
scope applies for example probably the

429
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,560
most important one is that you have to

430
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,570
designate a representative within the EU

431
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,440
so if you are located only in Japan but

432
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,230
you are doing business in Europe then it

433
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,960
might be necessary to designate a

434
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,950
representative within the EU who will

435
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,320
help you with with regulations but will

436
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,450
also forward for example requests from

437
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,860
data subjects or requests from data

438
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,330
protection authorities and article 31

439
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,030
other states that you have an obligation

440
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:26,189
to cooperate with the supervisory

441
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,340
authority here of course that's the

442
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,040
question if it if that will work out or

443
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,429
what the Supervisory authorities will be

444
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:39,570
able to do in case you you don't want to

445
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,340
cooperate and on an international level

446
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,399
of course European data protection

447
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,750
authorities could try to get in contact

448
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,750
with the Japanese Data Protection

449
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:52,770
Authority but this will be a pretty long

450
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:55,940
process so on a practical basis even if

451
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:59,250
you are supposed to comply with the gdpr

452
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:03,510
maybe there is no possibility for

453
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:08,480
supervisory authorities to really get

454
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:13,040
you to to comply with the gdpr

455
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,890
so looking again at the three cases and

456
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:19,530
summarizing at the different cases the

457
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,810
first is pretty easy if a data subject

458
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,970
is located in the u and the data is

459
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,679
processed by an au entity there is no

460
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:31,760
international relation then of course

461
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,850
the only the local law will apply and no

462
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,850
Japanese law will apply while in the

463
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,399
second case the who did the data subject

464
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:43,100
is located and they the data is

465
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,760
collected by an entity within the EU and

466
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,830
then transferred to a Japanese company

467
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,490
which will be the case and in in many

468
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:55,399
groups and in many cases then in Japan

469
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:58,280
of course the local Japanese law applies

470
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,180
which is the APPI the basic policy the

471
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:04,639
supplementary rules they always apply

472
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,490
for a Japanese companies and in addition

473
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,630
the Japanese enforcement rules will

474
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:13,850
apply and some GDP our purpose

475
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,090
limitation so basically you are only

476
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:19,790
allowed to process the personal data for

477
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,840
the purposes of its which were set by

478
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:27,320
the entity in Europe and of course if

479
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,000
there was other parts of the adequacy

480
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,450
decision for example if we are talking

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,650
about us data transfers and you are

482
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:38,600
relying on the privacy shield then you

483
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,710
instead of the enforcement rules you

484
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,120
need to comply with the privacy field if

485
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,550
you use the standard contractual

486
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,649
exhausts you will need to comply with

487
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,149
the basic rules stated within the

488
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,060
conjecture electrolysis

489
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,040
but looking at Japan thanks to the Edit

490
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,960
we see decision the most important thing

491
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,659
will be to rely of course on Trapani's

492
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:05,330
law and in addition to this enforcement

493
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:07,870
rules and looking at the third

494
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:12,649
possibility when data is collected

495
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:15,560
directly from Japan from they you then

496
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,330
in Japan of course the appi basic

497
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,790
policies implemented will still apply

498
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,100
because it's Japanese law but in

499
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:26,690
addition in this third case the whole

500
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:30,439
GDP are I will apply so actually it

501
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:34,070
might be a good thing to to try to use

502
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,680
more of the the second possibilities and

503
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,679
this might give you more flexibility

504
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,780
within the company because in the second

505
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,810
case not

506
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:46,870
there's not a full gdpr applicability

507
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,899
well in the third case the gt-r I will

508
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,419
apply fully so you might think of

509
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,270
transferring at the personnel data from

510
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:01,600
the you from a company located in the U

511
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:04,240
and then transferring it so a father

512
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,469
third and last part I want to give you

513
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:15,550
some information on IT security in GDP

514
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:18,220
our and a PPI I've rented out here most

515
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:22,060
of their compliance applications which

516
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,450
the GD P R has included I won't go into

517
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,820
detail on all these obligations because

518
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,370
then we would need a third day for a

519
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,250
code blue tomorrow and I just want to

520
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,270
focus on the security of processing and

521
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:39,400
these provisions as stated in the GD P R

522
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,920
but before that since we had some

523
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:46,030
interesting talks yesterday on supply

524
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,750
chain attacks I want to point out the

525
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:52,810
question of the contract data processing

526
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:56,620
so a contracts you have to conclude with

527
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:59,290
service providers in case these service

528
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:03,070
providers are processing data on behalf

529
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:05,500
of you then I'll take you 28 states that

530
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,679
you have to conclude such a data

531
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,920
processing agreement and when talking

532
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,440
about supply chain attacks and the

533
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,360
question of trusting your service

534
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,980
provider or maybe not trusting your

535
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,780
service provider that GD P R and this

536
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,200
contract data processing might actually

537
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,660
help to ensure trust in your providers

538
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,210
for example because you have several

539
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:35,290
audit obligations and audit

540
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:37,420
possibilities so you are if a contract

541
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:40,210
data processing agreement is concluded

542
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,910
you are allowed to audit the processor

543
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,640
and so this might help to give you more

544
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,620
information and also other of these

545
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:53,330
compliance obligations might actually

546
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,330
help regarding such threats to

547
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,889
the supply chain for example

548
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,040
notification of personal data breaches

549
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:04,190
you have 72 hours in case of a data

550
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,909
breach like hacking a tank or the loss

551
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:11,090
of personal data and also the service

552
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:14,000
providers are required to inform the

553
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:17,330
controller whom the data belongs to

554
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,820
within 72 hours so this is also an

555
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:24,530
provision which could help regarding

556
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:27,290
such security threats but I want to

557
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:30,980
focus on the provisions on a security of

558
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:35,810
processing and compare the provisions

559
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:39,920
between gdpr and a PPI so the gdpr and

560
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:42,290
article 32 states pretty broad a range

561
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,400
of technical and organizational measures

562
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:50,840
which every company has to fulfill and

563
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:54,200
in article 32 paragraph 1 the GPR says

564
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,620
that such measures are soldered Animas

565
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,150
ation encryption of personal data the

566
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,820
ongoing confidentiality year the

567
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:04,040
ensuring the integrity ensuring the

568
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:07,429
availability ensuring their resilience

569
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:10,720
of processing systems furthermore you

570
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:13,820
need to have the ability to restore the

571
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:18,140
availability in a case of a security

572
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:20,629
incident and also you are required to

573
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,220
have a process for regularly testing

574
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,220
assessing and evaluating the

575
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,360
effectiveness of the taken measures so

576
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:32,720
the GDP our state's a broad range of

577
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:35,000
applications to fulfill and after all

578
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,670
the interesting features I heard in the

579
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,630
last one and a half days it seems like a

580
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:43,610
pretty good thing as we have all those

581
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:47,270
regulations because as our business are

582
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:50,719
actually required to relate to such a

583
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,940
possible incidence and the GDP are

584
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,290
furthermore states that costs and risks

585
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:00,070
are to be taken account and so basically

586
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:03,800
as a small as a medium-sized companies

587
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,850
you don't have to comply with all the

588
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,970
same

589
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,870
two rules as a large company as a large

590
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:14,210
group but even though the GDP our

591
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,070
state's net costs are one relevant

592
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,590
factor they are just a one relevant

593
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,870
factor and the more relevant factor is

594
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,449
of course the risks so even if you are a

595
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:27,289
small company but for example you

596
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:31,279
process biometric data then the risk is

597
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:33,950
higher and then you are required to have

598
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,669
a stronger technical and organizational

599
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:40,580
measures in place so I think this is

600
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:43,580
pretty interesting and well done by the

601
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,990
GD P R because it's not only regarding

602
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,129
the possible loss of data but there

603
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,519
regarding technical organizational

604
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:55,219
measures the GPR has a full approach

605
00:31:52,519 --> 00:32:01,100
also as treasurer stressing the

606
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:04,879
availability of data in the a PPI and in

607
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:08,230
other countries it's mostly more limited

608
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:10,519
so the API states in article 20 that

609
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,799
personal information handling business

610
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,799
operator so the same as a controller in

611
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,620
Europe take necessary and appropriate

612
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,710
action for the security control of

613
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,870
personal data so this of course also is

614
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:28,820
a general obligation to ensure IT

615
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:30,860
security but the a PPI continues that

616
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,889
including the prevention of leakage

617
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:38,418
north or a damage of it's handled

618
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:40,758
personal data so the API stresses that

619
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:44,470
IT security measures are as opposed to

620
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:48,139
mostly prevent leakage and loss of data

621
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:51,980
but still it says that all necessary

622
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:55,399
appropriate action needs to be taken so

623
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:58,659
the API stresses minimizing risks of

624
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:03,408
data loss even though it is not the only

625
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:05,629
requirement and I think this difference

626
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:09,500
is pretty important in an international

627
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:11,299
context when I'm checking data

628
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,029
processing agreements as in many

629
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:19,190
providers especially u.s. providers who

630
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:21,169
binding themselves to appropriate

631
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:25,940
technical organizational measures only

632
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:30,260
regarding to ensuring preventing leakage

633
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:32,960
loss or damage to personal data but this

634
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,299
is too short as though if the gdpr is

635
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,039
applicable it's a not as efficient just

636
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:40,250
to say we will have appropriate measures

637
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,529
in place to avoid the loss of data but

638
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:46,460
it is also necessary to ensure the

639
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:49,309
ongoing availability of the data so this

640
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,370
is one point which is and which should

641
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:58,639
be checked in contracts regarding to

642
00:33:52,370 --> 00:34:02,350
their GDP are so coming to an end just

643
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:05,600
some short information what the GDP are

644
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:08,210
requires or what is recommended under

645
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,839
the GDP are to document IT security

646
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,659
measures so I guess many of you know the

647
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,659
accountability principle which states

648
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:20,000
that you need to prove that you comply

649
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,770
with a data protection law this of

650
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,739
course leads to quite a lot of

651
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,480
bureaucracy and it helps the data

652
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:30,888
protection authorities to easily

653
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:35,000
identify potential preachers of the GDP

654
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:39,409
are still this there

655
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,899
this principle is common is a common

656
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:45,919
sense within the GD P R and in some way

657
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:49,699
you need to rely to article 5 paragraph

658
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:52,609
2 and article 24 of the GD P R and

659
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:55,540
therefore of course also IT security

660
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:58,549
measures I need to be a documented and

661
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:02,720
so my recommendation is to have at least

662
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:05,390
a two step documentation of the IT

663
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,189
security measures I guess most of you

664
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:12,500
and your companies will have that

665
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:14,690
anyways but I want to stress that having

666
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,580
a data security process in place as

667
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,310
something required by the GD P R and

668
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:23,119
also the documentation of IT security

669
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:25,160
measures so the data security process

670
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,020
means basically that you need to take

671
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,700
management measures to protect your

672
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,800
personal data and

673
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:34,490
we have this data security process

674
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,150
documented in a way that for example the

675
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:41,000
data protection authorities are able to

676
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:43,820
control whether your process is done

677
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,040
correctly and it is efficient on the

678
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,609
other hand the documentation of IT

679
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,770
security measures it contains

680
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:56,200
information on a confidentiality

681
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:59,570
integrity availability and capacity and

682
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,990
I think I don't need to go into details

683
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,300
on how to describe these measures or

684
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:07,598
what measures you need to take we heard

685
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,940
a lot about that in the last two days

686
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,670
what I want to stress that is important

687
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,820
to document these measures we have an

688
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:19,609
internal document in place where you are

689
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,849
writing down which message measures you

690
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:25,040
are taking and how you are auditing them

691
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:32,450
how you are ensuring that they are

692
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:36,259
always up to date so coming to the

693
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:40,339
conclusion and some lessons learned I

694
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,410
want to recoup for the last minutes so

695
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:45,380
basically we are seeing more and more

696
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:49,609
data protection laws all over the world

697
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:54,020
and it more and more our will come and

698
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:59,299
more will be stronger will have more

699
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:01,670
strict views on data protection and of

700
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,980
course it's not easy as an international

701
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:08,530
company to handle all those different

702
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:11,900
data protection laws so especially

703
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:15,339
looking at the GD P R and the a PPI they

704
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:18,050
are really close together and it's it's

705
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:21,109
easier to process

706
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:24,319
both of these data then with for example

707
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:28,009
the CCPA because it takes a different

708
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:31,460
approach so maybe it will be necessary

709
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:35,230
for companies to contact data audits and

710
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:39,680
to check for which a kind of data which

711
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:42,900
data protection laws will be applicable

712
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,940
also ensuring the tagging and

713
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,620
documentation of all data within a

714
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:52,890
company will help to you know to

715
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,040
identify the data processed in the

716
00:37:52,890 --> 00:38:00,330
company and to ensure that such tech

717
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,570
data is processed by the laws which are

718
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:06,180
applying when looking at personal data

719
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,580
personal information or PII most

720
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:12,000
information on identifiable individuals

721
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:15,299
are covered and I want to stress again

722
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,940
that even saw the numerous data is

723
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,610
considered personal data by the gdpr as

724
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,650
though it has a really broad approach

725
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:25,010
with a PPI probably it will be about the

726
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:30,000
same while a PII

727
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:33,300
at least up to this point is not so not

728
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,880
covering all sahjhan image data what I

729
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,690
skipped today atutor time reasons was

730
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,740
Anna numerous information this is

731
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:45,780
something which is included in the a PPI

732
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:48,240
because HTTP are simply says if a data

733
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,270
is an animus then the gdpr doesn't apply

734
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,330
and in all other cases it applies the

735
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,970
API it takes in my point of view the

736
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:59,520
better approach than the gdpr because it

737
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,730
says in many cases it might be not

738
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,240
possible to insure a hundred present

739
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:09,300
anonymity of personal data and these

740
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,209
cases there are special rules on what to

741
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,910
relate to with unanimously processed

742
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:18,360
information and this rule and the API

743
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:23,040
might help to process data and to use

744
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:27,440
data on an active way regarding data

745
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:33,420
which might be anonymous or at least

746
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:35,010
mostly anonymous so most loss most data

747
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,110
protection laws in the world include

748
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,680
provisions on extraterritorial

749
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:43,440
applicability especially I want to

750
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,020
stress at the gdpr the obligation to

751
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,170
point our representative so it's not

752
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,870
only necessary to apply comply with all

753
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,650
the GPR rules but you also should have

754
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:55,500
one represent

755
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:59,970
in the you to ensure that you can cover

756
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:02,010
these standards and organizing the

757
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,439
processing in a way to avoid the full

758
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,539
HTTP our responsibility I already

759
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,270
mentioned that for example it might make

760
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:11,279
sense to process data by a European

761
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,900
company because then the European

762
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:17,880
company will have to comply with the

763
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:21,380
gdpr but there are less rules for in

764
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:25,380
Japan or in other third countries and

765
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:29,520
coming to an end or regarding IT

766
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:31,770
security measures the gdpr requires not

767
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,960
only to document the measures but also

768
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:37,910
to ensure a tank integrity and

769
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:41,910
availability of the personal data so

770
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:44,098
thank you very much for for listening

771
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:49,799
and I'm around afterwards if you have

772
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:50,930
any questions please contact me I think

773
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:54,640
it was I must stop

774
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,640
[Applause]
