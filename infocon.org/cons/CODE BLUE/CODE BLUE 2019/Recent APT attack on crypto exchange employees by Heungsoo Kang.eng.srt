1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,860
first thing about this talk we'll start

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,538
with Who I am

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,070
my name is hounsou I work for a line and

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,369
as you all know it's a mobile messenger

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:24,009
and we have lots of services including

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,990
cryptocurrency exchanges and we care

7
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:33,880
about security very much we have lots of

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:37,599
security researchers in our company so

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,710
as we all hurt Philips talk today in the

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
morning coinbase was attacked and

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,990
attacked by a very sophisticated highly

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,030
targeted attackers and it was released

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,510
in Queen based blog by Philip Martin

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:56,350
himself and there's a decent analysis on

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,530
object cecum about the malware and it's

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:04,239
not disclosed but line was also targeted

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:08,770
and this talk is about the same campaign

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:13,289
and how it looked to us and how we how I

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,289
dig into how we dug into the attackers

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,939
so the goal of this talk is first to

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,979
share the perspective of the victim how

22
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,798
it looked how it looked like him how

23
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,289
normal it looked how unsuspicious it

24
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,840
looked and the perspective of the

25
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:35,259
attackers what they had to prepare what

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,719
kind of engagement they were in and the

27
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,389
perspective of the blue team which is us

28
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:44,048
what we could see and what we could not

29
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:47,469
see and also share some information

30
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:52,689
about the malware they used and a little

31
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:57,189
more about the attackers themselves so

32
00:01:52,689 --> 00:02:00,249
the first is the victim a little bit

33
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:02,949
information about the victim is he is a

34
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:05,829
very talented developer he worked in

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,619
global companies in Silicon Valley he

36
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:12,640
has 10 more than a decade year of

37
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,740
experience and he was using iPhone and

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,559
MacBook Pro for his work and his

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,560
personal personal computing

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,989
so the attack started from an email

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:32,650
conversation just like coinbase case so

42
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:36,609
one day the victim gets an email from in

43
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,970
this case nm 603 at Cambridge that AC

44
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:43,780
that UK so he got it to his personal

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,920
account which is Gmail and if you see

46
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,140
the sender it is legit from Cambridge

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,569
University we looked at the email

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,858
headers he had passed all the security

49
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:59,440
measures like SPF or DKIM Demark etc so

50
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:04,870
it was literally sent by the Cambridge

51
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:07,680
email server and there's a link at the

52
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,659
content to the Cambridge University

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:16,840
which is just a normal page talking

54
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:18,638
about the award which is they call the

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,609
Adams prize which is the real thing

56
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:25,239
they are looking for field experts like

57
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:27,609
like you and we could get some help he

58
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:32,739
introduced himself as a organizer of the

59
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:37,000
other prize and if you look at the email

60
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:39,970
there is a LinkedIn profile link so if

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,669
you click it there's a guy shows up in

62
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:47,590
LinkedIn named Neal Morris he has 100

63
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,680
plus more than hundred connections and

64
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:54,519
his careers profit fit to the story very

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,739
nicely at first we actually thought this

66
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,680
guy was real and he was being

67
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:05,739
impersonated but turns out he this

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,659
profile itself is fake so victim has no

69
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,639
doubt at all he shares conversation

70
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:13,448
through email what kind of help do you

71
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:16,780
need from me and Neal Morris guy replies

72
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:22,090
will will get will arrange what we need

73
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:25,479
from you and get back to you and after

74
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:28,150
some conversation they sends a link to

75
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,700
the victim which is also inside the

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,870
Cambridge and he gives a login ID and

77
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,140
password

78
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:39,040
please login with this ID and password

79
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:42,250
but this is a temporary password so you

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:50,290
need to change it after you login for

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:53,730
security so he visits the link to see

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:59,950
the message that browsers not supported

83
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:02,140
that he should use Firefox so the link

84
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,620
to the Firefox is really official

85
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,539
Firefox download page this used to

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,180
happen a lot back in the times when

87
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,650
browsers only I mean webpages only

88
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:19,360
support Internet Explorer or vice versa

89
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:22,030
so the victim thought yeah why not so he

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,690
downloads Firefox and uses it to browse

91
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,830
the same page and the web page shows up

92
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:31,810
there's a ID and password form and he

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:36,789
tried to log in with the given ID and

94
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:38,610
password but the login didn't work this

95
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,290
code actually this page actually is

96
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:48,700
ripped off from the actual Cambridge

97
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:53,140
login page so at this point the victims

98
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,960
machine was exploited and Firefox shell

99
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,680
code ran inside Firefox and the shell

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:04,180
code used curl or crl to download the

101
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,030
real malware to avoid mac OS gatekeeper

102
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,060
which means if you use your browser to

103
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,489
download executable the gate and try to

104
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,680
execute it the gatekeeper will block

105
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,980
wait this file is downloaded by this

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,010
browser do you really want to execute it

107
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:24,070
but if you use a tool like curl or W get

108
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,400
and execute it the gatekeeper won't show

109
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,950
any message so they actually from the

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35,500
shell code they used curl to download

111
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:37,599
the malware and executed it so

112
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,700
fortunately in our case to that the

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,389
attack was stopped here it was detected

114
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:47,639
and there were mistakes they made

115
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,159
they could have done better but um those

116
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,490
raised some flags and we could detected

117
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:58,020
it we use some indicators and in-house

118
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,110
tools to stop the attack here so what we

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,750
what did we do with the victim

120
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,819
we started interrogating him why did you

121
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,539
do that why did you put our company in

122
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,699
danger and of course this is a joke we

123
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,159
talked to the victim and he helped us a

124
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,580
lot to investigate what actually

125
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:20,819
happened though so security team

126
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,659
followed up we did some tracking what

127
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:27,139
happened where was the attack from and

128
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:31,560
how did the malware get downloaded and

129
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:34,379
we put we made some fake environment to

130
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,949
run the malware to see what they do and

131
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:43,050
it actually downloaded stage to malware

132
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:46,199
after some time just like coinbase so

133
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,789
afterwards the malware's war attacked as

134
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,639
net why riot and Mokes Friant the names

135
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,529
actually don't matter really much but it

136
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:02,460
helps when you track down the same

137
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:05,219
campaign from the same attackers so the

138
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,109
second perspective is the attackers what

139
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:12,060
did they really do to prepare this

140
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:15,330
attack first they would have to prepare

141
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,120
weapons they would prepare weaponized

142
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,688
exploits in this case Firefox and of

143
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,389
course all the modern browsers have

144
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:27,990
sandbox in their systems so that you

145
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:30,240
need at least two exploits to weaponized

146
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:36,269
exploits first for code execution and

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:39,959
second for sandbox escape and they will

148
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:43,948
have to prepare malware it is very

149
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:47,790
common in malware malware campaign an

150
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:50,969
apt campaign to divide stages on their

151
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,949
attacks so for the stage one they're

152
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,680
responsible for it's like a Scout

153
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,300
they're very small they're very low

154
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,660
detected and

155
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,240
they are for reconnaissance they want to

156
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:09,030
look for what kind of victim is he

157
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,760
security product he's using etc etc and

158
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:21,569
stage 2 was the full rat or remote

159
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:24,689
administrator tool and they will have to

160
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:28,140
prepare infrastructure or servers they

161
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,660
separated all the servers into all the

162
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,990
roles of servers into multiple servers

163
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,360
so they use different servers for c2 and

164
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,730
use different servers for hosting

165
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,580
malware and use different servers for

166
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,550
hosting exploits either

167
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:48,600
so for c2 they used q hoster in uruguay

168
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:52,949
for stage 2 c2 they used these web from

169
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,700
UK or digitalocean from us to host

170
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,170
malware which means the server where

171
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:03,450
where the shell code used to download

172
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:06,329
the malware is from Russia and they

173
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,710
hosted their exploit in OVH calm which

174
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:15,000
is in France and they para domain

175
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:18,300
analytics fit calm and all these VPS

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:25,250
services they accept credit cards PayPal

177
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:28,439
web cash and of course Bitcoin and the

178
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,990
hacked accounts they hacked accounts to

179
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,560
use for the attack they hacked at least

180
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:41,440
two accounts from Cambridge which is nm

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:43,839
603 and gr h 37 the

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,680
that for hacking these accounts were not

183
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,720
disclosed they never announced it it may

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,109
be it might have been fishing or

185
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,180
credential stuffing which means using

186
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,100
leaked ID and password or it could have

187
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,849
been brute forcing or there could have

188
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,270
been a bug in their webpage codes or

189
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,820
they could have just dumped D be

190
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,130
compromised the whole DB where there's

191
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,990
an if there was a bug in their database

192
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:18,970
meaning management system like SQL

193
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:22,000
injection and if you get an account to

194
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,630
any university you of course get the

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,880
email access and commonly you get

196
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:31,260
another very nice feature which is a

197
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,840
personal web page hosting service and

198
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,080
you can search every account in Jack

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,730
Dolf which is very good for OS int so if

200
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,640
you search

201
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,150
it's a jackdaw at Cambridge that a CA UK

202
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,210
and anybody without any accounts can

203
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,490
search everybody so if you search a it

204
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:56,550
will list all the accounts starting with

205
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:59,880
a and of course our victims are

206
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,880
searchable too

207
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,699
so not only email addresses they give

208
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,070
you personal webpage hosting which is

209
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,780
people that the Assad came Cambridge

210
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,320
that AC dot uk'

211
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,050
and if you add your ID at the end that's

212
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,270
your personal page it's a very common

213
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,209
feature in universities where you can

214
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:27,010
host your profile your research your

215
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:29,590
papers and everything else so they use

216
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,650
these features to make a very look

217
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:35,770
legend the email domain was Cambridge

218
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:38,920
and the page domain was Cambridge - that

219
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:44,740
gives very big authenticity to the

220
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:50,290
attackers and they will have to prepare

221
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:57,400
the website the fake web page - to be

222
00:12:50,290 --> 00:13:00,160
shown for the victim they actually added

223
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,590
they use the real page from Cambridge

224
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,260
and added some simple HTML code in

225
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:08,710
JavaScript code for their own purpose

226
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:12,160
and they added a simple code and layer

227
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,560
to show please use Firefox to browse

228
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,660
this page and they added a link to the

229
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:26,050
exploit so this is part of a script on

230
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:29,589
the fake website the JavaScript checks

231
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:33,040
the operating system and browser so if

232
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:36,340
it's using Mac OS but not Firefox it'll

233
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:41,410
show please use Firefox to browse this

234
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:44,440
page and if you're you if the victim or

235
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:48,630
the visitor is using Mac OS and Firefox

236
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:53,290
it will show the webpage and load

237
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:57,930
/script KS from the server so this must

238
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:01,870
be the exploit that's what I thought

239
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,599
yeah it loads this /script yeah yes it

240
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,270
should be the exploit but turns out it

241
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,120
was not it was it returned 404 it was

242
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:13,630
not there might been a it could be a

243
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,350
fake code or it could be left over from

244
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,910
their previous campaign

245
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,830
so it could be a fake like this the

246
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,160
actual exploit was at the end of the

247
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,940
HTML page where they added a loading a

248
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,079
JavaScript from analytics fit comm

249
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,480
almost every website has a Google

250
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,270
Analytics JavaScript at the end of their

251
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,930
page and they wanted to make it look

252
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:46,120
just like that so nobody would you know

253
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:46,120
suspect it and the traffic is using HTTP

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,320
and after grabbing university account

255
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,530
and preparing University fake websites

256
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,460
they will have to prepare John Doe

257
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:06,319
because they got the account named nm

258
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:09,800
603 and grh 37 they made up their fake

259
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:15,320
identity with Neal Morris and Gregory

260
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:18,219
Harris and they joined LinkedIn and make

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:24,110
a profile to fit the story nicely and

262
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:26,120
the added connections and I if I get in

263
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,000
connection requests in LinkedIn I just

264
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:34,520
accept every request maybe that's how

265
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,660
they got so many connections and of

266
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,540
course they will have to write a nice

267
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,540
email signature to look at very legit

268
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,699
then they could start operation they

269
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:50,229
could look for targets to send emails

270
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,880
look for cryptocurrency employees and

271
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:58,520
start by opening conversation through

272
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:02,210
email and during the conversation they

273
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,100
evaluate their targets they don't send

274
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,410
out their exploits to everyone just like

275
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,510
philip mentioned they guide only

276
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,510
selected targets to the exploit page

277
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,140
there is another case on the internet a

278
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:21,710
guy named Robert Heaton he also talked

279
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:25,960
to the same email attackers and this

280
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,960
blog is about how he almost got hacked

281
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,610
so he talked with grh 37 at Cambridge

282
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,939
and he was never guided to the final

283
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,610
exploit page so he was actually selected

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,790
initially selected as target but he was

285
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:44,660
faded out he was evaluated out because

286
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,640
he works in financial IT but turns out

287
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:55,010
he works for a payment company so they

288
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:57,860
were not interested so he he uploaded a

289
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,140
screenshot of the email conversation you

290
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,180
can see that Gregory Harris guy is

291
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,459
saying we'll come back with we'll come

292
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,510
back to you with more information and he

293
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:11,709
never heard from him again

294
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:14,540
a funny thing is he wrote in his page

295
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,060
after he found out everything happened

296
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,920
why doesn't he just use please use

297
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,129
Firefox I would have definitely used

298
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,670
Firefox but they actually do but he

299
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:32,060
never got the chance to see it which is

300
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:34,550
this page so after exploit exploiting

301
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:38,360
the machines of cryptocurrency exploit

302
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:41,270
employees the goal would be running

303
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:48,530
stage one malware and running stage two

304
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:50,379
malware and go for the profit now is the

305
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,690
perspective of the blue team which is us

306
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,750
what we can see but in what we cannot

307
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,750
see

308
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,620
it's very cliche to say there are too

309
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,500
many stuff to watch for the blue team

310
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,709
yes and there are too many flags that

311
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:11,690
are raising like false positive flags we

312
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:15,140
have very very many employees from many

313
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,860
countries we have huge infrastructure we

314
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:22,880
have our own AWS like system we have our

315
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:26,929
researchers can launch VMS of numbers of

316
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,740
their wish as many as they want so or we

317
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:35,560
have lots of servers inside but we do

318
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:38,480
have some ways to protect ourselves from

319
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,760
infrastructure level we can monitor a

320
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,500
network pack

321
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:48,250
and there are some solutions that offers

322
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:51,340
a visibility on HTTP connections which

323
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,990
is which I don't like and from the

324
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,010
endpoint we can detect what's running

325
00:18:52,990 --> 00:19:00,610
inside the RF colleagues computers

326
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:02,800
what's just like the EDR or antivirus

327
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,870
and there are patch management system

328
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,669
and there are eyes monitoring solutions

329
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:13,929
etc etc and we can run honeypot since an

330
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:16,630
boxes inside our network and we can pay

331
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:21,760
for IOC or indicators of compromised

332
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:25,660
service we can apply Network segregation

333
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,390
or air gapping to harden or in internal

334
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:32,490
network and we can apply two-factor

335
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:36,760
authentication for better authentication

336
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:41,020
and more and more of course we can apply

337
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,450
everything but we have to find a find a

338
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,240
point where we don't harm the

339
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,220
productivity of our colleagues if you

340
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:54,340
apply everything your if your colleagues

341
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:57,340
are going to hate you and the pain point

342
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,010
for Blue team in this case is that the

343
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,750
attackers send email to victims personal

344
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:07,770
gmail account and we in our mail server

345
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:11,350
we don't have via email to look over and

346
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:16,800
they used real Cambridge servers and web

347
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:20,830
site which is very not suspicious

348
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:24,909
they used HTTP connection with encrypted

349
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:27,610
communication for their malware and the

350
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:30,130
stage 1 stage 2 malware has very low

351
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:33,250
detection the stage 1 malware had one

352
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:36,040
detection based on virus total from a

353
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:40,960
Chinese vendor and stage 2 has zero

354
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,659
detection and the communications are all

355
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,720
encrypted and connected to port 80 or

356
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:52,660
port 443 and like I shared they use

357
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,480
diverse use of servers they split

358
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,840
everything into

359
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,480
multiple IP addresses multiple countries

360
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,330
and I'm not sure if this is a

361
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,960
coincidence or they they were after this

362
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:09,678
but the stage one did not download stage

363
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,750
two for a while and after I set up a

364
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,429
fake environment that looks like Corp

365
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,780
environment

366
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:20,240
I brought the laptop home and I could

367
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,460
see that stage 2 download it then so

368
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,200
they might have been waiting for the

369
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,520
employee to move outside the company or

370
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:32,059
it could be just coincidence who knows

371
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,820
and some breadcrumbs for blue team what

372
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:37,668
we could see they the shell code used

373
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:42,799
curl to download macro binary directly

374
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:44,600
and it was not encrypted so in the

375
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,668
network level we could see a macro

376
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,219
binary being executed on loaded and

377
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:51,470
executed from the endpoint and the

378
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,990
communication was made to suspicious IP

379
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,770
addresses which is not bound to any

380
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,860
domains and there were new executable

381
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:03,760
files with a very suspicious name which

382
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:08,389
is which tried to look like a normal

383
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,520
Apple diamond service and we had

384
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:16,850
security team resource to follow up plus

385
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,690
some other indicators that I would not

386
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,760
like to disclose because they could

387
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:26,210
after they see it they could just apply

388
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,330
to their next campaign which would help

389
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,540
them

390
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:35,809
little bit about the malware the stage

391
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,389
one is net wire bryant net wire is a

392
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:42,678
commercial administration tool you can

393
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:45,309
buy it online and it's a basically agent

394
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:48,860
builder so if you put like c2 or

395
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:52,990
password or anything of your options in

396
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:55,549
site and you can build a client binary

397
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,860
and this is a screenshot from youtube

398
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:00,850
because i didn't want to actually buy

399
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,850
the product

400
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,420
this is a hash of the year stage 1

401
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,909
binary and it was downloaded from that

402
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,510
server with the name of icon services

403
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:17,850
agent which is a Apple Mac OS daemon

404
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:20,610
name which is very suspicious and the c2

405
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,689
server is that one but the port is now

406
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,030
closed and the binary is not signed

407
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:30,960
their previous campaign they they liked

408
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:34,920
signing their binaries with a with a

409
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:39,180
legit but with a certificate that looks

410
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:43,800
like they bought us somewhere and this

411
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:46,710
time they didn't sign this binary the c2

412
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:51,720
protocol is known and is uploaded in

413
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:54,660
github but it looks either the protocol

414
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,030
on the page is old or they made an

415
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:01,140
modification on their version because

416
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:07,530
XOR they used an XOR to their to the

417
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:10,710
known command these are some common

418
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,990
features of a apt Malheur but I'd still

419
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,840
like to share they can report the user

420
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,570
information host information about

421
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,629
information about the network and they

422
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:25,860
try to find out the external IP address

423
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:29,760
of the victim through check IP DUI dns

424
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:33,300
org so with that the attackers could

425
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,090
know where the victims work if they if

426
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,460
the IP address shows to line or coinbase

427
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:43,020
they will know where the victim is

428
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:47,400
located of course it could list process

429
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:53,160
and they could start a shell to to

430
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:57,150
accept any commands they could search or

431
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,820
write or execute any files and of course

432
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:03,600
there's heartbeats sending server

433
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:05,520
reporting that I'm still alive so this

434
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,270
is the actual packet capture from the

435
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,450
stage one and the first part the red

436
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,629
part is the part where

437
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:18,880
the malware reports that haven't started

438
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:22,340
executing and the first command is to

439
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,290
report system information and the big

440
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,780
red part is the system information and

441
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:33,230
after that it's just heartbeat just

442
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:36,379
sending I'm alive I'm alive and for

443
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:39,800
persistence it uses launch control which

444
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:48,100
means it will try to execute again after

445
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:52,280
reboot it will show in user login items

446
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:54,230
and it adds itself to signal handler

447
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,590
which means if something happens in

448
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:03,400
process crashes it still wants to

449
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:07,370
restart its process again and the shell

450
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:10,730
remote shell function I showed it uses

451
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,510
bin shell and it'll leave shell history

452
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:18,020
to the disk so actually shell as history

453
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:20,930
was left to the fake machine if you see

454
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,990
it download after it downloads stage to

455
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:28,160
malware it will move to temp directory

456
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:30,890
and add executable oughtn't executable

457
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,230
access to the binary and run it so this

458
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:39,650
was actually the history of the attacker

459
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:45,590
and in this stage one there's a unique

460
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:49,370
string hid seven dot dot dot it's a it's

461
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:55,669
an RC four key they used to decrypt a R

462
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:58,070
and a string named percent rant and I'm

463
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,710
not sure if it's not changeable or they

464
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,050
just don't change it but this string is

465
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,140
using of being used over and over again

466
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,020
so if you google with this string you'll

467
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:13,100
get a less you'll get some analysis

468
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:17,240
report from security researchers from

469
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,840
Poland or Turkey and in Japan a nice one

470
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,840
in LA see

471
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,889
so furthest for the stage one server I

472
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,740
brute-force the server to see if there's

473
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:35,330
other binaries and I could get some and

474
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:38,720
I used like a dir B Derb and after that

475
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,310
I used a Python script to download brute

476
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,770
force download anything from the server

477
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:48,409
and I could get some variety

478
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:50,510
the server they all have same code they

479
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,210
just have different data because of

480
00:27:50,510 --> 00:28:00,230
different RC for key but still they all

481
00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:03,320
have hide seven string these are the

482
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,310
hashes for new varieties and I uploaded

483
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,129
it in virustotal

484
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:13,760
and you can download here for research

485
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:15,950
and for Stage two hashes as follows it

486
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:23,060
was downloaded by stage one after some

487
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:26,210
time its mok's Friant it's a full remote

488
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,030
administrator tool with c2 server as

489
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:32,180
follows the servers are all alive but

490
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,889
the ports are closed second one has an

491
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,760
open port but it's not sending any

492
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:42,850
payload and the second ones digital

493
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,850
certificate is invalid maybe it's been

494
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,780
sync old by some security firm and

495
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,380
overview of the stage 2 it was built

496
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:58,430
with QT so it's a QT binary and it's a

497
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:01,460
very huge binary it's 13 megabytes so I

498
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:05,480
try to add signatures on QT libraries

499
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,760
open SSL libraries kokoa anything that's

500
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,300
Mac was related and I could only

501
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,860
identify only 20% of the binary so it's

502
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:21,139
too much binary to look at and this was

503
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:24,229
not signed either some features of the

504
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:28,660
binary is it copies itself to randomly

505
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:31,190
one of these names to look normal and

506
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,790
also it uses launch control for a

507
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,790
persistence

508
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,639
and it hides itself from Akua stock

509
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,200
which means because it's a QT binary

510
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:45,590
simple hello world will show at the

511
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,669
macro stock so this will this will be

512
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:51,949
visible to the victims so they added

513
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:55,970
environment variable to make it go away

514
00:29:51,950 --> 00:30:00,019
bye QT and it looks for files like Doc

515
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,450
do CX or Excel files and if you see the

516
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:05,210
function name I added this screenshot

517
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:09,080
because they they either accidentally or

518
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:12,110
intentionally made this function export

519
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,600
it which means this function file in a

520
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,459
function name is named by the attackers

521
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:22,689
was the actual function name from the

522
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:27,799
source code and more about the campaign

523
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:29,750
connecting dots on their work habits so

524
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:33,019
they don't have they didn't have names

525
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,669
until recently and some of the after

526
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:38,120
Queen check some of those Japanese

527
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:41,269
security firms like la C named them hide

528
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,928
seven from the string rz4 key string

529
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:47,090
other than that they don't have a name

530
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:49,610
they are known for attacking banks and

531
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:52,639
attacking financial businesses of

532
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,100
unknown names and they were introduced

533
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:58,789
in fireEye

534
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:02,539
there's a nice overview from Mertz arica

535
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:05,389
calm I met the he's a Turkish guy and I

536
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:09,169
met met him last month and talked to him

537
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:14,689
and he shared about how they are active

538
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:17,600
in Turkey attacking banks and there's

539
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:20,960
another analysis document from exetel

540
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,260
which is polish and LACC watch also

541
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,260
wrote a nice report on coin check hack

542
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,590
they like to use spearfishing for

543
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:39,379
opening their campaign so they use the

544
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:41,809
office document with macro and they use

545
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,659
office one day exploit or they use

546
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:47,178
WinRAR exploit and in this case they use

547
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:47,900
Firefox zero day exploit and they like

548
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:51,260
to

549
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:56,210
have a history of using Windows zero day

550
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:58,940
elevation of privilege exploit to and

551
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,820
they really like hacking universities

552
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,370
this case they hacked London of London

553
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:07,730
School of Economics account and they use

554
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:11,899
the email for communication saying we

555
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:15,260
I'm organized of a of a price and we're

556
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:22,300
looking for exploits like you for Bank

557
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:24,860
rewards the same thing and they use

558
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,690
universities web hosting to they really

559
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,699
like it in this case this was Miami

560
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:34,340
University and they hosted a document

561
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:40,270
file word file and it was embedding

562
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:42,500
macro or EPS exploit on this document

563
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:44,510
and they're not afraid of making

564
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,180
conference calls they actually call the

565
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:51,050
victim and guide them to please enable

566
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:54,230
the office macro or oh hey I'm the guy

567
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:58,300
who sent the email and this calling the

568
00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:01,670
victim gives them pretty much credential

569
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:06,379
and their favorite method is used

570
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:09,350
LinkedIn to increase the credibility the

571
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,510
this case they impersonated someone with

572
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,969
a similar names so they hacked account

573
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:18,110
of a London School of Economics the

574
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:21,950
account was MC Livadia and they found a

575
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:24,709
guy in LinkedIn Mario Mateus a Lovato

576
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:27,710
and they linked they added a link to

577
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:31,550
this guy's LinkedIn page actually he's

578
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:35,780
from a different University but how many

579
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,409
people look deep into these this case

580
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:42,139
they hacked

581
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:46,280
Angelina College and their favorite VPS

582
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:50,930
is OVH from France LeaseWeb from UK King

583
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:53,530
service from Russia and Q another King

584
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,960
servers just the first to France and UK

585
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:59,990
their previous campaign they used OVH in

586
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,680
these web for six times at least and the

587
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:11,010
other services they own

588
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:13,830
used once so why him at first I thought

589
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:17,900
they were after our crypto currency

590
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:21,569
exchange and then another idea came that

591
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:24,750
because only one guy was targeted in our

592
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:28,650
case unlike coinbase they initially at

593
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,520
send email to 200 employees but in this

594
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:34,650
case in our case it was just one guy so

595
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,860
why one guy did they like not find

596
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:40,130
employees on offline online but it's

597
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,980
pretty easy to find line employees

598
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:46,440
working for cryptocurrency so was it

599
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,540
attacking exchange or were they

600
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,240
attacking individual because they were

601
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,509
known for attacking individuals that

602
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,669
looks like to have many bitcoins so if

603
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:00,330
somebody is posting a cryptocurrency

604
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:04,230
forum that that he's doing autonomous

605
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:07,549
trading BOTS they attack him to get the

606
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,550
bitcoins out of him

607
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:15,720
so conclusion about the attackers they

608
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,200
they have a very good skill on social

609
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,270
engineering they they use compromised

610
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,640
University accounts for email and

611
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,090
website hosting and they are very

612
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:31,109
responsive on communication they reply

613
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:35,040
very good and they even call you with

614
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:38,640
their own phone and they use zero day or

615
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:42,690
n day exploits or just office with macro

616
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,319
and their malware is net wire and Mokes

617
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:49,710
and they they manage their malware

618
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,200
binary to have very low detections

619
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,710
and they use digital certificates to

620
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,210
sign their binaries and their malware

621
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,370
are platform-independent

622
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,160
from source code levels so they have

623
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:05,630
malware running on Windows running on

624
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,850
Mac OS and running on Linux too and

625
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,750
they're very active and they're very

626
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,750
skilled operators

627
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,809
and four countermeasure

628
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,670
how can he prevent or block such kind of

629
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:25,359
attacks it's a very difficult question

630
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:30,880
because such a discrete attackers it's

631
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:35,170
at some point we are supposed to fail

632
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:38,089
for detections and sensors we have to

633
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:41,390
use all the information we have from

634
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:43,970
endpoint protection or network and write

635
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:47,269
our own honeypot sir you solutions use

636
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:50,538
indicators of compromise and use human

637
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:53,689
resource like researchers and we should

638
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:56,509
apply defense in death of course we can

639
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:59,299
if we didn't block the attackers at some

640
00:36:56,509 --> 00:37:02,230
point we have to block it and block them

641
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:06,259
in another point somewhere at some time

642
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:09,829
and of course user education is very

643
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:12,769
good to block spearfishing in our case

644
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:15,859
there was zero days and another case is

645
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:19,008
that we could see use of office with

646
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:24,589
macro files and it's a very suspicious

647
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:27,980
to force email email receivers to allow

648
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:31,849
a macro execution but still many people

649
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:37,239
fall for that so we should minimize the

650
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:37,239
risk while maintaining usable security

651
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:47,150
so that was my introduction about these

652
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:50,419
attackers and that's my contact if you

653
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:58,480
have any questions I'm here I'll be here

654
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:58,480
all day any other was a master
