1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,690
how's everyone doing I still awake are

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,790
you with me

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,529
so my name's Jake Kunz I'm with a

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,060
company called risk-based security I'm

5
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:22,480
excited to be here to talk about cyber

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,029
insurance how many people are excited

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,489
about insurance

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,000
some of you I love it I love it I love

9
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:33,460
that guy right there already so many of

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,110
you might have seen me speak before but

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,769
you don't recognize me because I used to

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,600
look like this guy all right and then I

13
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,460
decided I wanted a little privacy in my

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,239
life so I grew a beard now no one knows

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,440
who I am at all so if you can grow a

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,280
beard and you're looking for some

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,530
privacy it's a great thing to consider

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,780
so now I look like this guy right now

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,140
got the beard although my wife does not

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,640
like it one bit not at one bit so I've

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,219
been doing this stuff for a long time I

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,019
was in the security world and then I

23
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:08,860
actually made the move into the

24
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,750
insurance world so you know what I do is

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,120
we track vulnerabilities we track data

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,800
breaches so we take a very risk-based

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,200
approach right we named the company

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,970
risk-based security to try to figure out

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,190
what's going on and how to take care of

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,650
this stuff but I did spend some time

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,530
quite a bit of time at a cyber insurance

32
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,780
carrier working on this stuff so I'm

33
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,300
able to give you sort of a

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,580
behind-the-scenes background look now I

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,890
must say I almost didn't make this

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,679
conference because I'm a big Halloween

37
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,480
fan and I had a party that I had to go

38
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,390
to with my wife ahead of time so as much

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,070
as she hated the beard we actually did

40
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,520
this because I had all kinds of people

41
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,949
saying I look like Aquaman now I tell

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,670
them maybe Aquaman with no muscles but

43
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,800
that's okay

44
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,990
but very happy to be here I think I'm

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,000
actually going to be in the air flying

46
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,619
more hours than I'm actually here

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,540
spending with you guys but I'm really

48
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,140
excited to be here one of the best

49
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,600
conferences I've seen run kudos to kana

50
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,970
and the team really really excited to be

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,730
here okay so I want to talk a little bit

52
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,109
about the state of security so one of

53
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,340
the things that we do is we track data

54
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,930
breaches because we're trying to figure

55
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,480
out just what's going on out there and

56
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,350
on the left-hand side what you see is is

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,269
the number

58
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,430
of worldwide data breaches that we've

59
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,800
been able to figure out right this is

60
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,290
the frequency right this is this how

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,870
often are these things occurring okay

62
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,660
and on the right hand side this is the

63
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,950
number of records exposed while there's

64
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,590
lots of things that go into a data

65
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,790
breach the number of records seems to be

66
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,340
one of the biggest things when it comes

67
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,590
to severity what you can see is there's

68
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,190
absolutely no slowdown going on right

69
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,810
now right in fact there's been over

70
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,000
43,000 data breaches that have been

71
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,620
reported all time and you can imagine

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,780
there's probably a lot more that just

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,770
haven't been discovered yet

74
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,170
right when we actually looked at the

75
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,230
mid-year so we did some report of the

76
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,709
mid-year analysis for 2019 what we found

77
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,630
was was pretty alarming right over 3,800

78
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,880
unique data breaches have already been

79
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:17,049
reported just through the mid-year of

80
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,920
this year and yeah the number of records

81
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,960
4.1 billion records right I mean it's

82
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,630
just amazing the amount of data that's

83
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,590
being exposed now when we compared that

84
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:33,010
to the mid-year of 2018 what we found

85
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,890
was the number of breaches is up by 54%

86
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,579
and the number of records exposed is up

87
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:42,880
by 52% so we're on track for yet another

88
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,770
worst year ever right I feel like every

89
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,530
time I'm traveling and I'm giving talks

90
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,110
I just keep saying we're getting worse

91
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,920
we spend all this money on blinky little

92
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,270
lights and boxes and security vendors

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,540
but we keep having data breaches and

94
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,690
we're not getting better so that leads

95
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,929
the question of as embarrassing as this

96
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,170
is for us cybersecurity professionals is

97
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,350
it only a matter of when you know

98
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,510
instead of will it happen or if is it a

99
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,829
ticking time bomb that a data breach for

100
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,320
the most part is only the matter of when

101
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,669
now does the data breach cost money well

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,710
there's a lot of people out there that

103
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,900
will debate about how much it does cost

104
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,120
cost per record all those sorts of

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,849
things I'm not trying to get into that

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,919
debate whatsoever but what I will say is

107
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,129
yes if you have a data breach at your

108
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,770
organization it's going

109
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:38,929
to cost you money right so here we're

110
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,479
saying that it's pretty much going to

111
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:42,589
happen to you it's not great but it's a

112
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,938
good chance that you're gonna have a

113
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:47,059
data breach of your organization and

114
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,080
it's going to cost you money so let's

115
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:51,289
talk a little bit about a risk

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,508
management and insurance there are four

117
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:56,599
things that we can do with risk whether

118
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:59,360
you've been in the security industry for

119
00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:00,619
a long time or you're new right we talk

120
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,029
about risk because that's what we're

121
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:04,159
we're here to do all right

122
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,449
so there's four things we can do the

123
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:08,119
first thing that we can do is we can

124
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:11,089
avoid it if we can avoid risk that's

125
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:12,649
great that's the best but in the case

126
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,399
that we can't where there's something

127
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:17,300
that we need to do there's a business

128
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,979
project or something that needs to

129
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,889
happen then we want to say okay let's

130
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:24,498
let's mitigate things right let's put in

131
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,079
some controls and try to reduce the risk

132
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:29,539
so make it a little bit more reasonable

133
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,639
now in some cases the business project

134
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:34,519
or decision says I don't really care

135
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,679
about you security nerds right we need

136
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,719
to do this so we're going to accept the

137
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:41,508
wrists it's okay this is such a good

138
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:43,759
thing we understand but we're going to

139
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,800
move forward with it but believe it or

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,649
not there is a fourth thing that you can

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,999
do with risk called transfer we have

142
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,369
been trained on this from the very

143
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:54,050
beginning yet for some reason every time

144
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:56,389
we talk about risk transfer security

145
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,129
people I start twitching and they they

146
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,249
they don't they don't like it but there

147
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:03,169
is this concept of risk transfer okay so

148
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:05,749
when we think about transferring risk

149
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,938
what can we do first one is outsourcing

150
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:09,259
right if we're not so good at doing

151
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:11,089
something we could outsource it to

152
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,349
someone else and then they can assume

153
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,969
some of that risk

154
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,349
there's definitely contracts and

155
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:17,569
agreements right we could write a

156
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,669
contract where risk is transferred and

157
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:22,639
then we do have this concept of

158
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:24,318
insurance now why would you purchase

159
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,669
insurance and don't even think about

160
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,689
cyber insurance but just in general

161
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,839
insurance right number of reasons reduce

162
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:35,240
your liability loss recovery legal

163
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,729
requirements may be legally you need to

164
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,949
and in some cases you just get insurance

165
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,179
because you want a peace of mind you

166
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,949
want to be able to put your head on the

167
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,958
pillow at night go to sleep and know

168
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,719
that anything goes wrong it's okay

169
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,429
right and insurance typically

170
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:51,529
is purchased for your most valuable

171
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:52,609
assets hey you're not gonna get

172
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,819
insurance for something that doesn't

173
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,149
have much worth lots of insurance

174
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,379
coverage out there you can insure

175
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:04,909
buildings and people and fancy yachts

176
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:07,009
medical electronics

177
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:09,289
there's even insurance if you're gonna

178
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,729
go on a nice trip or a vacation I've

179
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,229
been working hard you want to go on a

180
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,359
trip and you just want to make sure

181
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:15,589
there's no storms or something to go bad

182
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,249
you can get insurance in case it goes

183
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:21,259
wrong they even in sell event insurance

184
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,239
or maybe you're planning a big special

185
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,939
day whether it's a conference or a

186
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:27,378
wedding and it rains on that wedding and

187
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:30,139
causes problems you get insurance for

188
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,939
that believe it or not ever been

189
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,529
traveling you go to get a rental car and

190
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:34,550
they say hey you want some insurance and

191
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,009
you're not quite sure if you should say

192
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,719
yes or not right there's even insurance

193
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:40,610
out there called umbrella insurance

194
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:42,169
where we're just not quite sure what you

195
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,839
need coverage for so we're gonna cover

196
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,029
lots of things only reason I bring this

197
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,339
up is all these insurance coverages are

198
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,099
very accepted people agree with this

199
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:55,639
makes sense but then when we talk about

200
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:57,289
cyber insurance people don't like it but

201
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,619
when you think about it your most

202
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:02,959
valuable asset right now is data right

203
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:05,449
data and systems and all these sorts of

204
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,279
things is valuable but yet we're not

205
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:12,379
quite there yet in the acceptance rate

206
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:14,360
so why do people hate also known as why

207
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:18,499
haven't more people or organizations

208
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,139
Balt cyber insurance yet they think they

209
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:23,179
have unbreakable security controls who

210
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,219
in the audience will raise their hand if

211
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:29,958
I do you think your organization has

212
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:33,409
unbreakable security controls I hope no

213
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,539
one raises their hand right so no Oracle

214
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,938
unbreakable Oracle buses out there it's

215
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,860
great to see you think the coverage

216
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:42,049
maybe won't last maybe you won't respond

217
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,209
I hear that all the time I understand

218
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:47,719
that don't believe it's a good spend of

219
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:51,349
budget they're not aware of the market

220
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,309
something else and maybe just don't

221
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,380
quite understand it so when I was in

222
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,870
security and then I first went into the

223
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,520
insurance world all of my friends

224
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,680
thought I had lost my mind

225
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,079
that I was ruining my career that I was

226
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,910
turning into a used-car salesman trying

227
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,690
to sell insurance and it was horrible

228
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,270
what was I doing

229
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,860
right and I understand that because in

230
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,829
many ways there's a there's a bad

231
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,540
reputation right with insurance I think

232
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,430
if you think about your personal

233
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,589
involvement maybe there was at one time

234
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,870
where something happened and and the

235
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,310
insurance company wasn't as fast or

236
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,620
didn't help you or didn't do the things

237
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,270
you wanted to do but on the flip side I

238
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,370
think if you think about the times in

239
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,520
your life when insurance was there for

240
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,250
you you may think hey this was there for

241
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,810
me was a good thing but right now cyber

242
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,150
insurance is getting a lot of negative

243
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,880
attention anytime there is a an issue

244
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,040
with with something going on it's in the

245
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,430
press about how bad it is right and in

246
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,770
some cases I get it there's some

247
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,349
question marks as it's grown growing in

248
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,540
other cases it's really cut and dry like

249
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,040
they didn't have cyber insurance so they

250
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,689
didn't have cyber cover right they were

251
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,810
trying to get it underneath the general

252
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,670
liability policy or something else so I

253
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,699
think most situations that I have seen

254
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:11,329
they appear to have a let's call a valid

255
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,010
reason whether you like it or not but

256
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,690
there have been a few situations and

257
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,880
some here recently that have presented a

258
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,570
concern that we need to watch as this

259
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:25,910
continues to evolve okay

260
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:28,220
many names many carriers it's for those

261
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,079
that don't like the word cyber I think

262
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,340
I've gotten over it the word of cyber

263
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,590
we're ok with it

264
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,900
you'll hear it cyber insurance cyber

265
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,160
liability there are some cases from time

266
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,410
to time where you'll hear call other

267
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,689
things like internet or data privacy

268
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,660
insurance things like that the key point

269
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,750
here is that there is little commonality

270
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:51,110
very little commonality between them ok

271
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,030
now when you think about a cyber

272
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,480
insurance policy and you maybe want to

273
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:59,270
compare it to your own life you know

274
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,490
insurance that you were used to there

275
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,130
are some similarities but in lots of

276
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,350
cases it's not the same thing but I what

277
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,780
I want you to understand our two sort of

278
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,040
concepts it's called first party and

279
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,520
third party

280
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,209
okay so first party this is when things

281
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,230
the insurance will pay

282
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:23,340
to fix things that we own okay and third

283
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,890
party is when we pay others for our

284
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,720
actions or believe it or not are in

285
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,000
actions when we didn't do something that

286
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,940
we should have because we've caused harm

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,590
okay this is important to think about as

288
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,780
you think about a security event right

289
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,880
including a data breach or or a

290
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,890
compromise so to make it a little

291
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,410
simpler here on the left you see the

292
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,150
tree falls on our car right we're

293
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,640
getting paid because our car was damaged

294
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,699
right first party seeing the the other

295
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,949
picture right we crash our car into

296
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,750
someone else we have to now pay because

297
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,970
we caused damage to to them third party

298
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,040
why does this matter it means it matters

299
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,750
because organizations can get a policy a

300
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,260
cyber insurance policy that can cover

301
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,690
both okay security events data Beach

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,600
data breach recovery costs but also

303
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,150
protection out of lawsuits that may

304
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,680
arise out of a data compromise so it's

305
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,660
very important when you think about this

306
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,780
to think about the type of events that

307
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,219
your organization may face so you can

308
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,560
determine what type of coverage you may

309
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,560
want you can see a bit more specifically

310
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,810
in here right forensics legal fees maybe

311
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,119
mailings credit monitoring all those

312
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,609
things could be covered right liability

313
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,230
defense call settlements all sorts of

314
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,120
things but there's lots of other

315
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,520
coverages to a lot of other first party

316
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,530
coverage system restoration getting you

317
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,449
back up and running next the extra

318
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,610
expense you may incur to get back up and

319
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,810
running and even payment of extortion

320
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,100
demands ransomware right right somewhere

321
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,229
is a big thing going on here

322
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,390
and also even believe it or not lost

323
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,240
business also revenues lots of things

324
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,650
that you can get coverage for I feel

325
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
like I said this at least once and I'm

326
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,699
hoping I'm gonna say it multiple times

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,880
not all cyber insurance policies are the

328
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:13,230
same they're not all the same so if any

329
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,160
one broad brushes cyber insurance you

330
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,630
know they probably don't know what

331
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,469
they're talking about because not all

332
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,480
policies are the same now as helpful

333
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,250
some of these policies can be you got to

334
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,120
think of some things that won't be

335
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,040
covered okay reputation damage while

336
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,050
this may be a really big thing

337
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,329
and important to people you're not going

338
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,430
to easily find coverage out there that

339
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:37,109
says there was a data breach your brands

340
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,290
been damaged here's some money for that

341
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,149
okay now there are services like PR

342
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,349
firms and crisis management and things

343
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:48,810
like that sure but not much

344
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,160
regular maintenance upgrades fixes this

345
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,079
one took me a bit to get my head wrapped

346
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,089
around but if you think about it

347
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,279
insurance is to dare to make you whole

348
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:59,310
right to get you back to where you were

349
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,410
so if you had some old system that you

350
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,089
didn't maintain some old phone system

351
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,069
that was horrible you didn't maintain

352
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,660
and you have a compromised through there

353
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:08,610
they're not gonna come in and say hey

354
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,810
here's this brand new VoIP system for

355
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,680
you shiny right if you have a car crash

356
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,000
they're gonna get you back into your

357
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,649
similar car they're not gonna show up

358
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,360
and say here's a Ferrari for you right

359
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,310
so you have to think about that now in

360
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,569
some ways it's a little confusing

361
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,518
because they're not going to put you

362
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,599
back to where you could get maybe hacked

363
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,389
again right so you have to look at it

364
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,730
economic value of data right if you have

365
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:35,160
a confidential business plan or you have

366
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,139
some sort of secret ingredient formula

367
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,130
or something it's hard to find coverage

368
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,380
for that right

369
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,939
in other cases too while you can get

370
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,209
coverage for this you have to think

371
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,670
about data in the care of someone else

372
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,899
okay if if they're evaluating you and

373
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,370
your security and you just start

374
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,709
throwing your information around a whole

375
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,690
bunch of other vendors and people it can

376
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:56,910
be tough you got to be careful now there

377
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,490
are some not so common exclusions ones

378
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,209
that I want you to be careful about

379
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:06,569
failure to encrypt data all right

380
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:09,930
so think about this you have a laptop

381
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:13,229
that goes missing right and it wasn't

382
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,880
encrypted and your insurance policy says

383
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,279
whoops you didn't encrypt no coverage

384
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,709
that's a bad one if you see that you

385
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,630
don't want that on there okay failure to

386
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,910
maintain or take reasonable steps to

387
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,899
maintain security if you ever see this

388
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,120
an insurance policy run this is horrible

389
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,470
right who could not make everyone look

390
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,490
bad that you're not doing the right

391
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:37,620
things okay sometimes they'll try to

392
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,660
limit coverage the reason why insurance

393
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,060
carriers do exclusions is they're not

394
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,920
entirely sure what it's going to cost

395
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,449
them or how

396
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,550
you know things are they're trying to

397
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,810
learn what the market looks like so what

398
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,329
they'll do sometimes is they'll put

399
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,699
exclusions and or even sometimes they'll

400
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,620
sub limit take the amount of money that

401
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,920
you can get and put it down in the

402
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,960
wording okay sometimes you'll see things

403
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,630
like failure to comply with PCI

404
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,310
standards right the PCI credit card data

405
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,040
standards they'll say oh if you're not

406
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,229
in compliant with that then you then you

407
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,400
don't get anything right these are all

408
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,590
things that you want to make sure you

409
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,449
don't find in there now there are some

410
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,580
other ones that may be okay business

411
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,490
income loss it is possible to get

412
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,980
coverage where if you're you go down

413
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,280
have some sort of maybe denial service

414
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,720
or a breach that takes your system down

415
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,910
they can actually say hey you've you've

416
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,380
lost money right and we'll look at that

417
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,329
and we can get you reimbursed for things

418
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,130
if you get a policy like that it may

419
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,630
cost you more money it made me not

420
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,210
something that you care about so you may

421
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,320
be okay if it's excluded but you may

422
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,270
want it in there so you want to be

423
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,620
careful and the other one down there

424
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,170
that I put there is called contingent

425
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,520
business interruption one of the things

426
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,569
the insurance carriers are worried about

427
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,250
right now are not so much an individual

428
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,320
date of reach a lot of these carriers

429
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,420
are handling between three and five data

430
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,790
breaches a day they're not worried about

431
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,920
maybe one or two here they're worried

432
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,980
about large events they're worried about

433
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,270
some sort of event that could cause

434
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,069
thousands of claims to all come in at

435
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,200
the same time so something like

436
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,450
contingent business interruption which

437
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,420
would mean someone else went down and

438
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:17,930
now we're down maybe cloud services

439
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,370
internet the grid right you can see in

440
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,040
some cases they'll try to protect

441
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,719
themself from that so these are not so

442
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,159
common ones that you want to look at and

443
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,069
see if it makes sense to you or get them

444
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,310
out there all together not all insurance

445
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,960
policies are the same right

446
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:35,929
it means you actually have to read the

447
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,910
policy you have to read the thing and if

448
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,570
you can't be bothered or you don't want

449
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,070
to do that hire someone to do it for you

450
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,770
there are these things called brokers

451
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,810
out there that their whole job is to

452
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,730
understand what carriers and cyber

453
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:53,550
assurance is available and they could

454
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:56,100
work with you to see what you need okay

455
00:17:53,550 --> 00:18:00,930
so integration of cyber liability

456
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,520
insurance in my view and everyone that

457
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,160
I've worked with executives understand

458
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,200
risk they understand risk they may not

459
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,910
understand all the security nerd stuff

460
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,340
we talked about but they understand risk

461
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,360
they understand the avoid mitigate

462
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:18,330
accept and transfers okay

463
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,800
organizations are already protecting

464
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,949
their important assets and there are

465
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,840
already transferring risk right almost

466
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,260
every company that you guys work for are

467
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,659
insuring property buildings casualty

468
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,850
coverage for accidents what's called

469
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,910
EPLI or Employment Practices Liability

470
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,580
to cover people right and even this

471
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,290
thing called technology Eno errors and

472
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,520
omissions to make sure that the services

473
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,500
you provide you're providing them

474
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,250
properly and in case you don't do a good

475
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,340
job there can be coverage okay now for

476
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,620
me a lot of cyber security people are

477
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,929
still chasing this perfect security

478
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,429
notion that we're gonna get we're gonna

479
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,820
get everything locked down perfectly

480
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,160
right but the reality is there's this

481
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,620
law of diminishing returns when you

482
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,840
start working on security and investment

483
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,320
into security whether it's just better

484
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,320
processes more people tools technology

485
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,290
you can make some very meaningful jumps

486
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,320
to improve but at some point spending a

487
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,270
lot of money doesn't move things as far

488
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,919
as you would like and we start to get

489
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,560
into this concept of maybe trying to

490
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,050
find optimal security right we're

491
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,450
spending so much more money what is it

492
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,190
going to do to move things but the

493
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,950
problem is there's still risk there's

494
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,510
still gaps right and this is where

495
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,000
insurance and transferring risk can

496
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,270
really come into play so integrating

497
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,760
insurance so we're gonna do this in US

498
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:49,790
dollars so I apologize for you having to

499
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,870
do the the translation conversion here

500
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,570
but let's think about it just for a

501
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,550
small business right small business

502
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,820
let's estimate that the small business

503
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,430
has approximately US dollars two to five

504
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,950
million in revenue okay pretty good

505
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,280
business not bad

506
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,870
and if we say to them you need to care

507
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,340
about security because everyone needs to

508
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,810
care about security right doesn't matter

509
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,810
what size you are security is important

510
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,550
so you need security staff right and

511
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,860
just can't have one you got to have lots

512
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,510
of security people right okay

513
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,209
you need to buy security software and

514
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,400
hardware and it's just not one thing you

515
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,760
need to buy antivirus encryption

516
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,600
firewalls IDs compliance you need to buy

517
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,300
all these things right lots of things as

518
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,800
security we need and then you need you

519
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,129
can't just do it yourself you need

520
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,840
external third-party validation right so

521
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,940
now we need security consultants to do

522
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,189
phone scans and pen tests and all these

523
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,350
things so if we're telling a small

524
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,640
business they need to get get involved

525
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,040
and get good at security we're telling

526
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,110
them they need to do a lot of things and

527
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,600
so if you think about that for a sake of

528
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,449
just an argument let's say it cost that

529
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,820
same business right they're making 2 to

530
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,100
5 million a year in revenues let's say

531
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,990
they spend approximately 200 thousand US

532
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,459
dollars per year on security and for the

533
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,080
sake of this let's let's just say that

534
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,670
that's not even the initial cost because

535
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,010
we know it'd be a heck of a lot more

536
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,310
based on the cost from what vendors are

537
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:20,160
providing for security tools this

538
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:24,510
estimate is very low it's very low

539
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,450
should they be spending more probably

540
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,770
but how much and by the way if they

541
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,700
spend more and more and more does this

542
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,770
mean they're not gonna have a data

543
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,960
breach here's what's interesting

544
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,450
typical costs for cyber insurance right

545
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,630
now are extremely reasonable also known

546
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:45,930
as I can't believe it's this cheap very

547
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,310
very cheap right now minimum premiums a

548
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,880
premium is what you pay to get it a

549
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:54,629
policy can be around a thousand US

550
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,870
dollars and you can get 1 million US

551
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:01,410
dollars in coverage one thousand dollars

552
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:03,479
will get you 1 million in coverage now

553
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,150
what's also interesting is these

554
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,310
carriers they don't want claims they

555
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,660
don't want to lose a million dollars so

556
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,429
they're actually providing risk

557
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,470
management services for free to

558
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,470
companies trying to get them better at

559
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,080
security so they don't have potentially

560
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,389
a big claim now price

561
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,330
can be very different based on industry

562
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:26,459
and controls okay so there are some

563
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,080
industries that are deemed higher risk

564
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,539
or you'll hear it called higher hazards

565
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,249
and so maybe you're not gonna get $1,000

566
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,809
right and in some cases there are

567
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:35,970
industries where the insurance folks

568
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,889
have said we don't we just don't even

569
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,879
want to touch that industry okay so it

570
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:43,678
varies but if we think about it many

571
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:45,719
smaller companies right now they don't

572
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,730
understand security they're not at

573
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,649
conferences like this they're not able

574
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:54,239
to spend and in many cases they're not

575
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:55,649
doing anything okay now larger

576
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,950
organizations can also get cyber

577
00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:00,809
insurance this isn't just a SME

578
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,970
conversation if we were to estimate a

579
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:07,049
large Hospital for example right we

580
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:10,889
could say 2 billion in US dollars in

581
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:12,600
revenues I'd say good chance for a

582
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,850
million dollars in coverage around a

583
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,408
hundred thousand US dollars and if they

584
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,408
want it five million in coverage

585
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:20,879
probably about 200 thousand dollars what

586
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:23,580
that means is it isn't a hundred

587
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:26,009
thousand dollars per every million right

588
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,289
as you get more you don't have to pay

589
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,970
the same amount now what's also really

590
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,470
interesting is there are a lot of

591
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,019
insurance carriers out there there are

592
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,299
hundreds of them in the marketplaces now

593
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,889
depending on locations and and what they

594
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:41,070
want to do it can it can vary who's

595
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:42,809
available for it but there are certain

596
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,678
carriers out there that can write up to

597
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:49,230
250 million US dollars by themselves and

598
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,299
if you need more than that they have

599
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,090
this concept of creating towers and

600
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,499
other carriers can come in together and

601
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,689
do this thing called access where they

602
00:23:55,499 --> 00:24:00,749
can get limits all the way up to 750

603
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,190
million US dollars that's a pretty big

604
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:04,259
Tower that you can get for this stuff

605
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,029
now so far what I've seen larger

606
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,070
organizations don't care about risk

607
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:10,350
management services like the smaller

608
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,840
businesses do but the good news is they

609
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,850
can utilize the service rates of the

610
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:20,158
carriers and we'll talk about that here

611
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:23,009
shortly say it with me not all Seibel

612
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,210
insurance policies are the same and by

613
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:28,139
the way they're not all priced the same

614
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,149
either so you need to shop around right

615
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:33,149
and you look around to see what makes

616
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:37,109
sense carrier getting the right coverage

617
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:39,508
and what prices may be available so

618
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:42,178
despite the limitations and there are

619
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:43,739
some okay I'm not going to tell you that

620
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,019
everything in the cyber insurance world

621
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:47,700
is perfect but despite the limitation

622
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,499
there's some real value in these

623
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:54,179
policies there's some real value in

624
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:55,649
there now interest is on the rise for a

625
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,960
long time when I was chatting about

626
00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:01,978
cyber insurance no one want to want to

627
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,509
talk about it right it's a it's a real

628
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,619
testament to the whole conference here

629
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,570
Code Blue that I'm actually here

630
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,279
speaking to you about this insurance is

631
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,710
something that we need to start taking

632
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,039
seriously now that being said just like

633
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,989
I told you earlier

634
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,658
anytime something goes wrong the media

635
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:20,940
is all over it so just a day or so ago

636
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:23,460
right there's an article about AIG is

637
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,690
backing away from coverage right the

638
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,969
whole whole situation where they're not

639
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,649
they're not wanting to pay because

640
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:33,179
there's some definitions of how the

641
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:36,658
crime was occurred okay another one that

642
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,909
was just sent to me here saying cyber

643
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,009
insurance has paid just a fraction

644
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,109
they paid just a fraction of the breach

645
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,389
related cost so far now what's

646
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,439
interesting is when you read that

647
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:48,539
immediately the headline makes you think

648
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,299
oh man this cyber insurance stuff it's

649
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,979
horrible but when you actually when you

650
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,080
read on the left hand side which is

651
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:57,450
about the the article which they

652
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,139
basically said ah look insurance pay it

653
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,570
out only about 6% of the 60 million US

654
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:06,089
dollars it cost right but if you

655
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,460
actually read what the company itself

656
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:11,549
put out they've basically said yes this

657
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,979
is what insurance has done so far and we

658
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,779
further think more compensation is going

659
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:18,059
to happen but we want to make sure it's

660
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,469
confirmed so we don't know what's gonna

661
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,269
happen yet but the article makes it

662
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:23,099
sound like insurance was horrible but

663
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:26,309
the reality is it's still playing itself

664
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:29,218
out to see what will be covered Twitter

665
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:31,469
Twitter's a funny place I get a lot of

666
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:33,330
hate tweets at me about cyber insurance

667
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:35,159
all the time but a lot of people will

668
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,928
particularly say cyber insurance isn't

669
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,999
gonna save you it's horrible and then

670
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,440
people jump in all the time saying they

671
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:42,149
never they don't pay claims

672
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,339
they'll never cover you right that

673
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:46,830
that's the constant thing of they're

674
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,530
never gonna pay anything right

675
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,490
well what's interesting is I know a lot

676
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,870
of insurance carriers they pay claims if

677
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,460
they weren't paying claims people

678
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,379
wouldn't be getting this stuff okay so

679
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,060
there's a concern and I understand and

680
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,700
there's some cases that come up that are

681
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,340
not as clear as we would like but even

682
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,160
here this is an article that came out

683
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,600
from the association of the British

684
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,990
insurance where they were looking at

685
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,240
claims in the UK and there was a small

686
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,040
sample size it was only 207 claims that

687
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,790
they looked at but what they found was

688
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,260
that 99% of the claims are paid so stat

689
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,790
statistics love him or hate him

690
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,410
but what I can tell you is what I've

691
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,409
seen if you have the right policy and

692
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:32,010
you have the right carrier they're

693
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:34,500
paying claims okay so love it or hate it

694
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,780
what do you need to know for the most

695
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,220
part I'd say a lot of you've been giving

696
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,570
me smiles some of you giving me the

697
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,360
looks that you don't like insurance and

698
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,070
that's totally okay and I really at this

699
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,379
point I don't care if you think it's

700
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,850
great or you hate it but there are some

701
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,380
things that I want you to leave here

702
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:53,909
today knowing first of all I believe if

703
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,310
your organization doesn't have cyber

704
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,960
insurance now it's going to pretty soon

705
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,960
whether you like it or not okay

706
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,730
professionals and responders if you're

707
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,590
in any sort of incident response a lot

708
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,040
of this messages for you I want you to

709
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,300
be very clear on what's going on here

710
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,310
but I want you involved I want you to

711
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,080
fill out the applications if your

712
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,870
company's already has insurance which

713
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,389
maybe they will usually that insurance

714
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,370
is purchased outside of IT so they may

715
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,810
be purchasing the wrong coverage they

716
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,340
may be it was not a great carrier they

717
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,139
may not know these things that you can

718
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,209
help with okay so help fill out the

719
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,550
questionnaires help figuring out what

720
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,620
the ins you know what you'll be covered

721
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,270
with and know what will be covered but

722
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,870
the most important thing is there are

723
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:42,540
requirements that a cyber policy cyber

724
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:45,810
insurance policy puts in place that you

725
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:49,350
need to definitely follow otherwise the

726
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:50,790
insurance will be nullified okay I tell

727
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,379
a lot of people sometimes these aren't

728
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,389
the Incident Response processes that

729
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,690
you're looking for you may not like this

730
00:28:54,390 --> 00:29:00,150
okay so most companies thus far have

731
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,730
focused on creating their own incident

732
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,309
management

733
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,610
Tessa's creating the ability to respond

734
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:08,590
to things right some of you in the room

735
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,740
have unfortunately had the opportunity

736
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,120
to actually respond to an incident right

737
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,790
but with insurance there are several

738
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,360
things in the process that might have to

739
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,950
change okay much of it is based on the

740
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,678
carrier and policy which is why it's

741
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,299
important you figure out if you have won

742
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,370
the claims process is much like a normal

743
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,650
personal insurance policy what you've

744
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,479
experienced on your own you have some

745
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,890
sort of a problem you got to call the

746
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,900
insurance company and file a claim you

747
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,250
got to tell them about it right from

748
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,110
there they're gonna assign what's called

749
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,270
a claims adjuster someone that will help

750
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,418
you through the process and then based

751
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,889
on your situation in the claim it'll

752
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:47,049
take several pass right lots of

753
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,450
different ways it could go now almost

754
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,879
all of these policies have requirements

755
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,850
about timely reporting some will say 30

756
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,799
days 60 days some will say as soon as

757
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,510
practical but they're basically saying

758
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,280
we want you to tell you is tell us as

759
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,160
soon as possible and you can understand

760
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,240
that right you don't they don't want a

761
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,610
data breach or something bad to happen

762
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,290
and then like months and months or years

763
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,070
later you call and say yeah this bad

764
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,710
thing happened

765
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,629
right carriers don't want that they want

766
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,870
to get involved as soon as possible

767
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,419
so that they can help you respond they

768
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:23,110
can help keep those things under control

769
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:25,120
and help you out okay now if you don't

770
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,280
tell the insurance care here quick

771
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,020
enough they could come back to you and

772
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,730
say sorry you didn't tell us the

773
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,950
contract the insurance policy said you

774
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,830
got to tell us within this timeframe now

775
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,049
there are also a lot of concerns about

776
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,600
what's called over reporting so if you

777
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,679
think about every single little thing

778
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,139
that happened your company

779
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,480
security-related that's a lot of stuff

780
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,270
right and if you told the insurance

781
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,830
carrier about every single one that may

782
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,210
make the insurance carrier go oh my

783
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,830
goodness what's happened at this company

784
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,110
right maybe we shouldn't give them

785
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,549
insurance or let's up their rates okay

786
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,649
so the people are concerned about that

787
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:00,850
what I would say to you is that you

788
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,770
don't need to tell them about every

789
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,780
little time you think something's going

790
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,790
on but if you think you have some sort

791
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,500
of potential larger issue or data breach

792
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,379
it's best to report it to them that's

793
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,879
the report as soon as possible

794
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:18,429
now insurance pays in two different ways

795
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:20,799
okay what's called pay on behalf and the

796
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,480
other one is called reimbursement now

797
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,360
pay on behalf this is more common these

798
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,090
days okay this is basically saying the

799
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,678
insurance carrier has providers they're

800
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,090
gonna contract them with it whether it's

801
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
forensics legal whatever it may be

802
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,699
they're gonna do that and they're just

803
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,879
gonna pay those those vendors directly

804
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,970
now what's a concern about this is that

805
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:45,248
in some cases you lose control of the

806
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,649
process and you can lose control of some

807
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:49,419
of the vendors so if you have vendors

808
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:52,178
that you're working with that you like

809
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:54,419
the insurance carrier may select someone

810
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:56,950
else to do forensics some other lawyer

811
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:00,009
okay so this is something you need be

812
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:03,100
mindful of now the reimbursement aspect

813
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:05,049
basically I see less insurance policies

814
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,939
doing it these days they'll say yeah you

815
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:09,039
go higher the vendors and find the

816
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,590
people you want to fix things and then

817
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,570
we'll pay you back okay and there are

818
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,668
some other situations depending on the

819
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,399
policy where reimbursement can come in

820
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:19,690
at a later time so what do you need to

821
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,689
know you need to know there's this thing

822
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,269
called a panel there's panels and what's

823
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,490
happening is insurance carriers want to

824
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,350
keep the prices low of a data breach

825
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,389
right they want to keep the prices down

826
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,399
and they want to respond to them

827
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:36,369
properly but one of the things that they

828
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:39,070
do is they create these panels for legal

829
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:41,559
folks security vendors forensics

830
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,240
notification monitoring even proactive

831
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,539
services and they go to these vendors

832
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,830
and they say hey we're gonna have a lot

833
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,960
of claims coming in we're gonna a lot of

834
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,389
business but I want your best rate and

835
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,220
if you have the great a right service

836
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,049
you're good at what you do and I can

837
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,850
negotiate a good rate then I'm gonna

838
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:00,999
send you all this work and so they

839
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,678
negotiate prices low now this is a

840
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:04,450
really really good thing that I want

841
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,429
everyone to think about if your

842
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,110
organization had a data breach and you

843
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,600
needed to get some external vendors in

844
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,070
to help and you call up is the first

845
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,689
thing you're gonna say hey let's

846
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,039
negotiate price are you gonna say get

847
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,309
here immediately I need help

848
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,710
right it's the worst time to negotiate

849
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:22,090
rates when you're trying to get someone

850
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,559
to come help you respond to something

851
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,830
right away so this is a really good

852
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,110
thing

853
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,549
it makes the insurance dollar stretch

854
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,649
farther but not only that

855
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,029
I tell companies all the time even if

856
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:34,908
you got a smaller amount of insurance

857
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:36,919
and let's say you needed a lot more you

858
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,279
can still use their services and those

859
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,049
rates so it's a really good thing but it

860
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,309
can be a huge concern for you again if

861
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:45,080
you have these preferred vendors that

862
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:46,309
you want to work with one of the things

863
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,259
that you can do though as you look at

864
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:50,330
insurance carriers ask her who on their

865
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:52,039
panels and if you really want someone in

866
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,509
particular and you might be able to say

867
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:57,859
what about these folks can they get on

868
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:59,059
there okay risk management services risk

869
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:00,468
management services are really

870
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,269
interesting they're also being called

871
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:05,869
right now a lot of times a breach coach

872
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:08,210
okay and so effectively some carriers

873
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:11,659
will set up these portals as a way to

874
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:13,279
triage an incident right so it may

875
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,470
require that you log into this portal

876
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:17,359
you may have to input something or in

877
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,489
some cases you may have to call a breach

878
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,839
coach and have a conversation with them

879
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,270
and then we ask questions about what's

880
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:26,058
going on to try to determine is this

881
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,038
really serious this is not is it are you

882
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:30,619
overreacting whatever it may it may be

883
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,970
the most important thing here is for

884
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,829
small to medium businesses this is

885
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,209
really good this is a great way for

886
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:38,450
people to be able to call up and say hey

887
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,250
I might have a situation for larger

888
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,439
organizations yeah they may still use

889
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,779
that but in many cases it may be the way

890
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,579
you need to report the claim so know the

891
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:51,020
process before you need to use it is the

892
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:53,029
message quick response with the rise of

893
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,369
cyber insurance it's clear that

894
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:56,960
responders just need to know how this

895
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,599
impacts them right I think traditionally

896
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,220
every organization has had a focus just

897
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,500
to respond as quick as possible

898
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,509
and try to do everything that you can

899
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,400
get things under control I think this is

900
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,049
still generally the right thing to do

901
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,329
but don't forget about in that

902
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:13,849
notification of claim it has to happen

903
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:16,010
basically at the same time if you start

904
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:17,839
going down a path making all kinds of

905
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,130
other decisions and the insurance

906
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,119
carrier doesn't like it it can be a

907
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,299
problem right can be a real problem all

908
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,880
right

909
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:29,990
cyber insurance in Japan so cyber

910
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,609
insurance for the most part has been

911
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,799
primarily talked about in the context of

912
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:35,328
the United States that is true there is

913
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,869
a lot of other activity out it but

914
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:40,279
you're mostly hearing about us sort of

915
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,410
conversation however cyber insurance is

916
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:45,529
available and it's growing and the

917
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,450
asia-pacific region there hasn't been as

918
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:50,029
much information that's come out really

919
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,220
outside of the US in terms of specific

920
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:54,109
claims and causes of loss and and

921
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,359
industries that are impacted so we're

922
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,058
we're still operating on as as with not

923
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,799
as much data as that was we would prefer

924
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:02,630
but when I took a look quickly all the

925
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:04,549
data breaches going on I said let's see

926
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,559
what's going on in Japan right we're

927
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:09,920
aware of 215 breaches that have occurred

928
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,180
right so there are breaches there maybe

929
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,589
more than maybe we just couldn't

930
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,339
translate and figure out what was going

931
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:18,410
on and over 176 million records have

932
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:20,538
been lost right so they're definitely

933
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:23,779
this isn't just data breaches happen in

934
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:26,269
the u.s. kind of thing now when we look

935
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:28,549
at also specifically for data breaches

936
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,779
in Japan we could see when you look at

937
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:32,779
sort of business groups as well as

938
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:34,729
economic sectors it's there's no one

939
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:37,489
immune right now right this isn't like

940
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:38,629
oh just just those big tech companies

941
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:40,309
they're the only ones that have the

942
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,930
problem that's not the case right we're

943
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:45,739
seeing it across all types of

944
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:47,029
organizations revenue size etc and

945
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:48,799
what's really interesting is when you

946
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:51,619
look at some of this you can see the

947
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:53,839
average records loss over 800,000 a lot

948
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,400
of hacking but not just hacking right

949
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,650
we're seeing companies exposing things

950
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,809
on the web where they shouldn't fraud in

951
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,509
social engineering among other things

952
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:03,559
that are leading to this now for me one

953
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:05,989
of the things that I found really

954
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:08,930
interesting was the acknowledgement

955
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:10,609
that's small the medium businesses don't

956
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,589
understand this stuff and need help and

957
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:15,078
so I saw some work that came out and in

958
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:16,400
June saying that trying to get people

959
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,539
together to figure out how can we

960
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,739
improve small to medium businesses I've

961
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:26,839
also seen reports from 2017 saying hey

962
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:30,140
as the security problems and threats

963
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:31,299
continue to increase here policies are

964
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,529
growing and you can see year-over-year

965
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:35,509
some data that's coming out about cyber

966
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:40,390
insurance premiums within Japan that's

967
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:43,400
growing I think also what's going on is

968
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:45,229
the whole region but Japan specifically

969
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,059
has been seen as a place that has more

970
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,919
and more threats coming and that they're

971
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:51,829
gonna see cyber insurance grow in in

972
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,249
this area without a doubt all right so

973
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:55,460
as we wrap down what are some actions

974
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:57,529
first

975
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,990
I want you to continue to invest into

976
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,120
security security is important I want

977
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,470
you to continue to work on it we don't

978
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,960
what's call we don't want what's called

979
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,509
a moral hazard right that's where you

980
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,090
say wait a second Jake just said this

981
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,530
stuff's really cheap and why don't I

982
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,520
just get insurance and stop doing

983
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:18,590
security no we don't want that okay

984
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,780
continue to invest in this in into

985
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,550
security as it makes sense and where it

986
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,460
is appropriate we want you to define a

987
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,200
response plan in case of a data breach

988
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,730
understand your exposures your data

989
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,000
stored how much records these are all

990
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:34,820
things that you need to do but what I'd

991
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,520
also like you to do is go find out if

992
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,720
you have insurance when you get back

993
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,970
start asking the questions we have

994
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,859
insurance you need to know for all the

995
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,350
reasons that we talked about now if you

996
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,310
find out that you don't have insurance

997
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,650
then I'd like you to have a conversation

998
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,529
with your executives with management and

999
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,390
say should we get coverage what kind of

1000
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,940
coverage should we get how much limits

1001
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,129
should we get and get a quote see what

1002
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,490
it would cost you and if it makes sense

1003
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:05,930
great integrate it as a part of it is

1004
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:08,509
not the only thing but as a part of so

1005
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,740
think about this effective security

1006
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,410
programs cost money

1007
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:15,620
yet they can still be compromised cyber

1008
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,120
insurance is is pretty affordable much

1009
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,850
more affordable than security solutions

1010
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,230
so while there can be some gotchas if

1011
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,240
you're a CSO or you're in charge of

1012
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,800
security and you had a data breach what

1013
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,140
do you want to say whoops sorry I

1014
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,510
thought we were unbreakable or do you

1015
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,629
want to say hey we have a partner let's

1016
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,250
file a claim I'd like you to be open to

1017
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,650
the idea that cyber insurance does have

1018
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,150
a valid place I'd like to you instead of

1019
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,430
being quick just to pick all the

1020
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,320
negative things out look for some of the

1021
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,319
positives especially when you're talking

1022
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,210
to smaller organizations if you're

1023
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,010
saying that it's horrible then maybe

1024
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,020
they won't do it and I think smaller

1025
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,910
organizations can be it can be a big

1026
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,800
deal for them and for larger companies

1027
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,540
think of your supply chain this is a

1028
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,750
great way to help them improve security

1029
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,910
okay so there's a clear need for

1030
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,650
organizations develop an incident

1031
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:07,040
response plan we know that have that

1032
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:09,230
plan prior to needing to use it but

1033
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,090
those breached reservists again

1034
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,940
carriers are handling three to five

1035
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:15,980
claims per day they're good at this

1036
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,180
they've been through this they know how

1037
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,580
to get through these things there's some

1038
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,410
real value there and in some cases some

1039
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,880
of those smaller companies they just

1040
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,830
want the Ghostbusters who you're gonna

1041
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,660
call they when something goes wrong they

1042
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:30,799
just want to call someone to say come

1043
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:33,259
help me okay so with that I have jammed

1044
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,570
in a lot of information I greatly

1045
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,250
appreciate you listening I think I've

1046
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,200
completely run out of time for any

1047
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,180
questions so I'm going to say thank you

1048
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,140
I will definitely stick around if

1049
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,520
there's anything you want to talk about

1050
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:51,429
please let me know thank you very much

1051
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,429
[Applause]
