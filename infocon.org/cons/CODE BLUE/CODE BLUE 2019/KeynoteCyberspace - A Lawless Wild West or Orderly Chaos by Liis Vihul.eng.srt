1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:12,910
so thank you code blue for having me

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:15,010
ladies and gentlemen good afternoon so

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,310
for this final session of the conference

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:21,369
I would like to invite you to venture

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,159
away with me from the predominantly

6
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,320
deeply technical issues that you have

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,250
focused on for the past two days and

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,190
venture into an area that is very

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,430
different namely into the realm of

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,769
international peace and security and in

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,699
particular the issue of the

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:49,710
international law of cyberspace so my

13
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:52,629
talk in particular will be about a very

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,629
contentious issue in the international

15
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:59,019
discourse concerning the international

16
00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:01,480
law of cyberspace it's an issue that has

17
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:04,449
been around for two decades that

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,090
continues to be unresolved that

19
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,780
continues to divide the international

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:13,150
community and it's an issue about what

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:19,180
kind of international legal architecture

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:22,750
is best suited to govern cyberspace at

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:25,630
times this issue is more dormant other

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,180
times it is more pervasive more

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,509
prevalent but what we can say with

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,810
certainty is that this issue continues

27
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,300
to underlie the policy discussions that

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:42,190
are taking place on the international

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:45,640
level between states now you may ask why

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:48,789
law why should we turn our attention to

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:53,190
law why is it important to talk about

32
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:56,140
the application of law in cyberspace a

33
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,740
transfer this question we need to

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:04,260
understand what law means at its very

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:08,440
fundamental level law is a mechanism for

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:11,140
formalizing a social construct in the

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,939
case of international law this social

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,238
construct is one that exists between

39
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,930
nation-states so international law

40
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,560
consists of agreement

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,530
between states that set forth certain

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,349
generally accepted principles of

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,439
behavior values that the international

44
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:35,069
community shares or particular states in

45
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,530
a region share and furthermore

46
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,078
international law provides us as the

47
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,269
international community of states

48
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:47,049
certain rules of what kind of behavior

49
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:50,530
is expected of us the states and what

50
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,440
kind of behavior is acceptable so that

51
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,799
is at the very abstract level the task

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,510
of international law what kind of

53
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,659
benefits do we get from having

54
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,120
international law that regulates

55
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:07,108
interstate cyber relations let me

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,480
mention two the first one is

57
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:13,840
predictability if we have those shared

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,450
values and principles those rules of

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,540
acceptable behavior set forth as

60
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:23,160
international law then on the interstate

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,650
level we will gain some predictability

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,530
we will have some foreseeability as to

63
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,959
how States will act in cyberspace

64
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,609
what kind of cyber activities they

65
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,389
consider to be permitted under

66
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:40,599
international law and what kind of cyber

67
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:45,010
operations they consider the law to

68
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:48,569
prohibit the states from engaging in now

69
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,530
with predictability comes stability

70
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,750
foreseeability and international

71
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,659
relations provide stability and

72
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,409
stability on the international plane is

73
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:01,959
a good thing so first what do we get out

74
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:05,500
of having international law we get

75
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:09,909
predictability we got foreseeability we

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,970
also get a degree of enforceability why

77
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:16,019
did I say a degree of enforceability the

78
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,220
possibility of enforcing those rules I

79
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,199
suspect that most of you are familiar

80
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:25,740
with your domestic legal systems

81
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,719
international law is very different from

82
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,010
all of the domestic systems of countries

83
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:34,100
in the world how is it different

84
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,630
well domestic

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,600
generally reflect the separation of

86
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,440
powers we have the legislature that

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,530
creates laws for a particular country we

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,500
have the executive branch that executes

89
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:53,008
and enforces those laws and then thirdly

90
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,319
we have the judiciary that applies and

91
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,229
interprets the laws so it's a

92
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,710
hierarchical sister system where there

93
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:02,659
are different degrees of authority

94
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,388
international law is very different

95
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:10,050
international law is horizontal who

96
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,740
makes international law states do who

97
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,800
enforces international law states do who

98
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,020
adjudicates upon international law

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,750
states - so all of those three powers

100
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,599
are vested in this one Authority the

101
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,550
state and this of course means that when

102
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:30,000
we're talking about contentious cyber

103
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,470
incidents between states international

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,840
law will only be enforced if States want

105
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,000
international law to be enforced and of

106
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,948
course the country that is being accused

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,729
of having breached international law

108
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,940
will not have much incentive in

109
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,250
international law enforcement why can't

110
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,740
we enforce international law like I said

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,710
this power is vested in the state we

112
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,050
don't have an international police force

113
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,448
that would do so initially it was

114
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,159
supposed to be the Security Council that

115
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,889
should have enforced law but the

116
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:07,620
Security Council is constantly stuck in

117
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,150
a veto it would of course be stuck in a

118
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,729
video when we're talking about cyber

119
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,080
incidents involving any of the prominent

120
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:18,508
five however when we think about having

121
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,440
international law in the cyber context

122
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:25,639
if our choices are no law that governs

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,070
interstate behavior in cyberspace or

124
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,080
having international law together with

125
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,169
its weaknesses some of which are

126
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,770
significant then obviously the better

127
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:40,590
option is the latter one so proceeding

128
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:45,570
on this basis what I will talk about

129
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:48,479
first is treaties generally then I will

130
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,450
talk about treaties in the cyber context

131
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,900
and thirdly I will talk a little bit

132
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,940
about what kind of role in Japan could

133
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,280
play in the international discourse

134
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:04,760
concerning which law to have in

135
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,830
cyberspace with regard to treaties

136
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,789
anybody who starts doing a little bit of

137
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:15,090
research into treaties in the cyber

138
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:19,560
context will almost instantly discover

139
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,570
that this issue is explosive okay

140
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,729
like I mentioned here the international

141
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,860
community is divided we have countries

142
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:28,229
that would like to see a treaty be

143
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,580
adopted for cyberspace and then we have

144
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,760
other countries that are violently

145
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,400
pushing back against the idea this is

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,120
somewhat odd because treaties as a

147
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,429
general matter or a good thing let me

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,080
give you some examples

149
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,260
think about the in charter of the United

150
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,639
Nations when the Charter was adopted in

151
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,130
1945 in June in San Francisco a little

152
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,770
before the second world war ended what

153
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,140
was the main objective of the countries

154
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,799
that had gathered at the international

155
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:05,940
conference to conclude the Charter they

156
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,919
had one main goal and that goal was to

157
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,190
ensure that history would not repeat

158
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,099
itself that the international community

159
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,550
would not be forced to witness another

160
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,120
world war that was the main goal of the

161
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,160
UN Charter let me give you a few more

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,650
examples think about the Paris agreement

163
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,530
the Paris agreement clearly did not go

164
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,799
as far as it should have it was labeled

165
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,478
as a failure by many but nevertheless if

166
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,390
we think about what the purpose of the

167
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,330
Paris agreement is successful or

168
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,810
unsuccessful as it may have been it is

169
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:49,790
to put a cap on global warming to

170
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:55,050
prevent the devastating consequences of

171
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:57,719
Unruh versa bowl global warming I have a

172
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,839
few more examples for you think about

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,290
the International Covenant on Civil and

174
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,820
Political

175
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,709
right this is one of the main

176
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,529
international global human rights

177
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:13,439
treaties that provides certain basic

178
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:17,459
rights to individuals in almost all the

179
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,269
countries of the world right such as

180
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,170
that to be free from torture the right

181
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:27,410
to be free from slavery or forced labor

182
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:30,209
the right to be free from discrimination

183
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,490
important in the cyber context the

184
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:34,040
rights to freedom of expression the

185
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,339
right to privacy

186
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:42,689
clearly this treaty serves a noble

187
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:45,870
purpose and then finally a bit more of

188
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,290
an exotic example there is a bilateral

189
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,050
agreement between Japan and Australia

190
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,079
that protects migratory birds that are

191
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,290
in danger of extinction and protects

192
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,779
their environment so who could argue

193
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,849
that this treaty does not serve a noble

194
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:08,959
purpose which is to preserve

195
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:14,010
biodiversity so at their core treaties

196
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:16,560
generally serve a good purpose treaties

197
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,139
are a mechanism for States to self

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,500
impose certain obligations that

199
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:25,560
sometimes are painful that sometimes are

200
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,110
costly and resource intense that limit

201
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,750
their authority to act but States

202
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,180
nevertheless decide to conclude those

203
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,089
agreements because of either their

204
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,638
social or their political their economic

205
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,579
values or like in the case of human

206
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,459
rights law the human dignity the value

207
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:47,040
of protecting the dignity of a human

208
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,869
being in the case of the bilateral

209
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,870
agreement between Japan and Australia

210
00:10:51,889 --> 00:11:00,029
you could say that certainly there's an

211
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,819
island somewhere in Japan that would be

212
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:06,540
the perfect place for somebody to live

213
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:08,910
with a beautiful beach with nice nature

214
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,719
and you would want to live there but

215
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,500
Japan has taken upon itself an

216
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,280
international commit

217
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,640
meant to not allow individuals to

218
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,579
habitate that island-y again in order to

219
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,400
protect that biodiversity it is imposing

220
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,200
a cost on the Japanese society but the

221
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,420
country has nevertheless decided to do

222
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,290
so because of the values that he

223
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,410
believes in

224
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,930
so if treaties are a good thing why do

225
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,500
we even need to ask the question whether

226
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,089
a treaty would be good for cyberspace

227
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,180
why do we even need to doubt this

228
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:48,930
proposition that a cyberspace treaty is

229
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:52,920
a good idea let's talk about this a

230
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:55,560
little bit some of you might not know

231
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,800
this but we actually have a few treaties

232
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,150
that already exist in cyberspace we have

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,000
the Budapest Convention on cybercrime

234
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:05,250
and we also have the Shanghai

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,810
Cooperation Organization

236
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,680
agreement it's known as the

237
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:13,229
Yekaterinburg agreement of 2009 the

238
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,560
concerns cooperation in the field of

239
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,300
international information security the

240
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,660
Shanghai Cooperation Organization today

241
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:25,260
has got 8 member states Russia China

242
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:29,160
Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan

243
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,920
Uzbekistan and as of 2017 India and

244
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,829
Pakistan so this is a regional treaty

245
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,459
that creates certain obligations for

246
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:40,860
those eight countries the Shanghai

247
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,620
Cooperation Organization has also been

248
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,790
pushing for a global treaty and it has

249
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,100
done so since 2011 they call this the

250
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,839
international code of conduct for

251
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,760
information security the member states

252
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,370
of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization

253
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,130
have submitted proposals under the

254
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:06,720
umbrella of the United Nations in 2011

255
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:09,720
and 2015 this proposal has not gathered

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,990
global acceptance we will talk about why

257
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,360
this is the case but like I said the

258
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,280
countries in the Shanghai Cooperation

259
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,310
Organization would ideally also like to

260
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,199
see a global treaty governing cyberspace

261
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,660
and then we have lots of liberal

262
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,520
democracies

263
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,510
who are pushing back against the idea of

264
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,569
having a treaty in cyberspace Japan is

265
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,010
one of them but the most vocal ones have

266
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,400
been the countries in the euro-atlantic

267
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:43,490
space the European Union made this

268
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,060
crystal clear in 2013 in its

269
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,550
cybersecurity strategy the European

270
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,849
Union explicitly said that it does not

271
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,040
call for the creation of new

272
00:13:51,850 --> 00:14:00,680
international legal instruments for

273
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,449
cyber issues now why is that the case we

274
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,280
spent quite a bit of time talking about

275
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,950
the fact that treaties are a good thing

276
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,100
why doesn't the you want to see treaties

277
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,990
in cyberspace why don't other liberal

278
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,710
democracies want to have a treaty in

279
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:18,560
cyberspace well today there is one very

280
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,440
powerful reason that has got nothing to

281
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,670
do with cyber but rather with the

282
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,830
current state of international affairs

283
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,490
we live in turbulent times I'm sure you

284
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:35,360
all agree in interstate relations we're

285
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,690
witnessing a lot of contestation a lot

286
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,140
of confrontation we're seeing a trend

287
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,750
towards isolationism we're seeing a lot

288
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,689
of competition and we're seeing

289
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,430
tough-guy politics rather than the

290
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,820
pursuit of friendly relations between

291
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,859
states and I'm sure you would agree that

292
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,570
this type of environment is not

293
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,940
conducive to treaty negotiations think

294
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,900
about the following example think about

295
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,320
brexit and the UK efforts to leave the

296
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,560
European Union clearly indicating a

297
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,320
desire against international

298
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,689
institutionalism think about the United

299
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,330
States withdrawing from pretty much

300
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,000
every treaty imaginable

301
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,130
most recently threatening to pull out of

302
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,460
the treaty establishing the

303
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,860
International Postal Union the United

304
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,290
States under the trump administration

305
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,380
has been so active in withdrawing from

306
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,680
treaties that it even led the former

307
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,430
legal adviser to the State Department

308
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,339
characterized the u.s.

309
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:46,310
actions as an assault on international

310
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:49,279
law so in this one hand were witnessing

311
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,339
a desire not to be involved in

312
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,320
international organizations and

313
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:56,510
international mechanisms and on the

314
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,709
other hand we're seeing some pretty

315
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:02,209
blatant violations of international law

316
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:05,390
think about what China is doing in its

317
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:09,050
western part in relation to the OE core

318
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:12,920
Muslim minority there is no doubt that

319
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,469
China is violating international law or

320
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,520
think about this recent report that

321
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:25,279
Russia is intentionally bombing

322
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:29,260
hospitals in Syria so 2019 is not a good

323
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:33,080
year for in-state international

324
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,450
institutionalism 2019 is not a good year

325
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,589
for international relations generally

326
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:42,290
and it certainly is not a good time for

327
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:44,390
international treaty negotiations so

328
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,029
this is one of the main reasons that

329
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,000
like I said has got nothing to do with

330
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:53,420
cyber while negotiating a cyber treaty

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,560
in this particular point in time would

332
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:01,160
be a futile effort there are however

333
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:05,300
some problems that are unique to the

334
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,819
idea of a global cyberspace treaty so

335
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,240
let me talk briefly also about those

336
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:17,770
issues that have directly to do with

337
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:21,380
cyber and the reasons why I say that in

338
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,970
2021 we definitely will not see a

339
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,500
convention on international

340
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:30,350
cybersecurity be adopted treaties

341
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,679
usually begin by identifying and

342
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:36,139
defining the terms with which the treaty

343
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,940
operates so it's usually the first or

344
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,929
second article in the treaty that

345
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:45,800
defines the key terms many of you will

346
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:49,790
know that terms in the cyber context are

347
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,800
also a contentious issue we might have

348
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,350
at the negotiating table

349
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:58,610
the Estonian diplomat put her hand

350
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:01,939
so let's define cybersecurity what would

351
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,269
happen next the Russian diplomat would

352
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,190
say what are you talking about we should

353
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:11,899
be talking about information security

354
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:15,799
not cybersecurity and this issue isn't

355
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:19,789
just about linguistic preference this

356
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:23,600
issue reflects a fundamental difference

357
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:27,440
in the scope of regulation that a

358
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:31,279
potential cyber security treaty should

359
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,529
undertake so Western liberal democracies

360
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,480
when they not in the context of a

361
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,519
cybersecurity treaty but in

362
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,240
cybersecurity negotiations generally

363
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,919
they prefer the term cyber security

364
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,340
because they're more concerned with

365
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,779
attacks against the infrastructure and

366
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,529
Russia and China and other

367
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:53,509
authoritarianism leaning countries they

368
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:56,389
yes they're concerned with the

369
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:58,669
cybersecurity aspects of the problem but

370
00:18:56,389 --> 00:19:02,389
perhaps even more they're concerned with

371
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:04,370
the information aspect of the problem in

372
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:06,889
other words they view as a threat for

373
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:10,879
themselves the information that can be

374
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:13,189
conveyed via this cyber medium and if

375
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:15,379
they were to engage in international

376
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,320
treaty making they would want to make

377
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:20,600
sure that the treaty also regulates what

378
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,168
kind of information states are allowed

379
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:28,370
to communicate by a cyberspace and what

380
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:30,470
kind of information is off-limits so

381
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,639
that's one problem it has to do with

382
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,769
definitions for me the bigger problem

383
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:40,399
has to do with what the treaty is

384
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:43,610
supposed to regulate the infrastructure

385
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:47,779
versus information issue is one but more

386
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:50,389
broadly today we have no idea what this

387
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:53,000
hypothetical cyber treaty should

388
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:57,439
regulate in other words what should its

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,019
articles 3 to 17 say and for this reason

390
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,590
this whole debate about treaty or no

391
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:06,830
treaty is somewhat bizarre the treaty is

392
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,649
supposed to regulate state conduct in

393
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,610
our car

394
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:14,640
texts in cyberspace but states even

395
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:18,840
individually and not just not least

396
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,270
collectively don't have a good idea as

397
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,610
to what kind of behavior they want to

398
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:30,030
allow in cyberspace and what kind of

399
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:32,729
behavior they certainly want to limit so

400
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:35,280
what is our second best option if a

401
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,059
tweet is off the table for now what are

402
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,120
we left with what we're left with at

403
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:45,149
least for the time being is to work with

404
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,178
what we have let me come back to the UN

405
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,920
Charter remember I told you that the

406
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:53,250
main purpose of the charter of the

407
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,150
United Nations was to prevent the

408
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,990
outbreak of war how does the United

409
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:03,690
Nations Charter achieve this purpose

410
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:07,679
firstly predominantly through Article

411
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:12,540
two Superga four that makes it illegal

412
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:16,770
for States to resort to force in their

413
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,440
interstate relations if you want to

414
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,080
analogize to domestic law then this is

415
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,260
one of the strongest constitutional

416
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,760
norms of international law use of force

417
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,890
is unlawful except in certain limited

418
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,190
cases for example when the Security

419
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,170
Council authorizes the use of force or

420
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:42,150
when the state is acting in self-defense

421
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,090
so we know for sure that the use of

422
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,650
force under existing international law

423
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:52,399
is unlawful in the cyber crack in the

424
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:56,820
cyber context the question now arises

425
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:00,960
can a cyber operation by one state ever

426
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,419
amount to an unlawful use of force in

427
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,540
the sense of the United Nations Charter

428
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,030
such that when the state engages in such

429
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:13,800
a cyber operation it has breached

430
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:16,470
article 2 subparagraph 4 lots and lots

431
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,050
and lots of academic literature has been

432
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,370
written on this topic the answer today

433
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:24,669
is an hour

434
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,909
wavering yes yes cyber operations

435
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:31,030
sometimes will constitute a use of force

436
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:34,809
and unless an exception to the use of

437
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:38,110
force exists that use of force will be

438
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,700
unlawful the big question is what kind

439
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,969
of cyber operations are we talking about

440
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,670
when would a cyber operation reach this

441
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,040
threshold and like I said a lot of

442
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:52,120
scholarship exists on this very issue

443
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:55,000
and slowly we're seeing states also come

444
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,979
out with their interpretations of this

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,510
particular provision in the cyber

446
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:03,520
context in the past couple of days I've

447
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,429
been asked a lot of questions about the

448
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,440
town manual many of you will have heard

449
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,110
of the towing manual many of you will

450
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,950
have not let me just briefly say that

451
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,449
the towing manual was an academic effort

452
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,340
hosted by the nato cooperative cyber

453
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:22,179
defence centre of excellence based in

454
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:24,309
tallinn estonia to look at how existing

455
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,440
international law the pre cyber

456
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:30,370
international law that was adopted

457
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,679
before cyber existed how this party of

458
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,409
international law applies in the cyber

459
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:38,230
context and how it either limit states

460
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:41,140
behavior or what kind of rights it

461
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:45,070
affords to States it is an academic

462
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,710
project it's more than 500 pages in

463
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,428
length what can you conclude from this

464
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,830
fact well you can conclude that existing

465
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,290
international law apparently must have

466
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,800
quite a bit to say about what states can

467
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:02,500
or cannot do in the cyber context and

468
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,020
the takeaway for the treaty discussion

469
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,350
is well obviously a treaty a cyber

470
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,990
treaty should only regulate state's

471
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:13,360
activities in cyberspace to the extent

472
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:17,410
they are not already governed by

473
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,129
existing law so this is treaties and

474
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:24,400
fiber what to think about this issue let

475
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:29,350
me now turn to Japan how could u Penn

476
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:32,679
participate in those discussions Japan

477
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,820
actually already does so the United

478
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,539
Nations secretary-general

479
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,939
tear invites member states to report to

480
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:45,139
the Secretary General on different

481
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,710
matters concerning cyber in the context

482
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:51,258
of international peace and security and

483
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,330
Japan has reported to the security to

484
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:57,590
the secretary-general on a couple of

485
00:24:53,330 --> 00:25:00,699
occasions most recently this year and in

486
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:04,459
its submission Japan among other things

487
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:07,580
upheld the notion that law plays a role

488
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,539
in cyberspace both domestic law and

489
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,658
international law are important

490
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:17,090
Japan has endorsed the premise that

491
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:22,330
existing international law applies which

492
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:24,678
means that it is not ultimately

493
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,639
necessary for states to start

494
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,320
negotiating the treaty straight away and

495
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:34,250
Japan sees the role of international law

496
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,939
as essential for the sustainable

497
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:41,120
development of cyberspace as a safe and

498
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:44,210
reliable place so that's a pretty good

499
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:49,070
start but what this statement doesn't

500
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,960
tell us is how Japan understands the

501
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,899
application of international law in the

502
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,539
cyber domain it doesn't tell us which

503
00:25:53,899 --> 00:26:00,168
rules in Japan considers to be important

504
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:02,419
which rules limit Japan's and of course

505
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,970
other states behavior in cyberspace and

506
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:09,500
what kind of rights international law

507
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:12,980
Accords to Japan but your country has an

508
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,980
opportunity to continue conversing on

509
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,799
this topic there are currently two

510
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,720
processes underway in the United Nations

511
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,799
that deal with the normative

512
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,320
architecture of cyberspace one of them

513
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,830
is the so-called United Nations group of

514
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,769
governmental experts so it is a group of

515
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:38,480
25 different country representatives

516
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:42,139
that meet between 2019 and 2021 and

517
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,779
they're tasked to look at the three key

518
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:47,689
components of the normative architecture

519
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:51,379
of cyberspace first

520
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,120
international law second voluntary

521
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:55,820
non-binding norms

522
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,758
of responsible state behavior that's

523
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,250
best practice if you will that is not

524
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,799
required by law but states that act

525
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,919
responsibly will nevertheless engagin

526
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:09,529
and third confidence-building measures

527
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,899
certain practical measures that will

528
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:14,500
help to build confidence between states

529
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:18,620
and that will help to prevent the

530
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,549
accidental breaking out of a conflict in

531
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,539
cyberspace this is the resolution that

532
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,809
establishes the group of governmental

533
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,789
experts the second process that is

534
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:31,460
currently underway in the United Nations

535
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:35,110
is the so called open-ended working

536
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,759
group and its mandate is very similar

537
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,549
why how two groups that deal with

538
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,740
essentially the same issue this is again

539
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:45,019
a manifestation of international

540
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,769
politics the group of governmental

541
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:52,490
experts was proposed by the United

542
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,899
States and the open D group open and a

543
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,179
working group was proposed by the

544
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:59,268
Russian Federation and the General

545
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:01,549
Assembly adopted both resolutions so now

546
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:04,190
we have two groups with a very similar

547
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:06,139
mandate the group of governmental

548
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,330
experts like I said consists of

549
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:11,928
representatives at 25 countries and

550
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:14,178
Japan is one of them I also said that

551
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:17,149
the GTE will be looking at dish of

552
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:21,200
international law this is what the

553
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:23,870
mandate says the group is expected to

554
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,529
produce a consensus report it might not

555
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:30,018
work out but if it does then that

556
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:33,259
consensus report should have an annex

557
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:35,990
that consists of the National positions

558
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:38,809
of all of the 25 countries that are

559
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,080
members of the gge on the issue of how

560
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:45,559
those countries interpret law in the

561
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,620
cyber context so Japan will be expected

562
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:53,389
to publish such a report that will be

563
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:56,029
annexed to the GG's report when Japan

564
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:58,070
does so I'm sure that your country will

565
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:01,010
look at what other countries have said

566
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,350
in the past there are a hands

567
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:06,860
countries that have come out with pretty

568
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:09,560
detailed articulations of how they

569
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:13,750
understand and apply international law

570
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:17,030
in cyberspace one is the United States

571
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,640
they have several documents one of them

572
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,790
is from the Department of Defense it is

573
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,670
the law war manual and here they have a

574
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:28,190
robust chapter on how the United States

575
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:31,850
would apply the law of armed conflict

576
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:36,950
the law of war to cyber operations that

577
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:39,800
occur in the context of the war then we

578
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,140
have a speech by the United Kingdom by

579
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,200
the UK's former attorney general from

580
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,380
last year in that speech the United

581
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,560
Kingdom set forth some principles of

582
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:54,680
international law that they follow

583
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,929
predominantly during peacetime and then

584
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,300
finally just a few months ago the

585
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,880
Netherlands government submitted a

586
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,120
report to the Netherlands Parliament a

587
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,330
nine page report talking about how the

588
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,770
Netherlands applies and understands

589
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:14,720
international law in cyberspace now if

590
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,000
you were to look at those documents more

591
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,260
closely you'll see that there's a lot of

592
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,550
text but none of those documents really

593
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:27,230
get to the heart of the matter which is

594
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:29,480
what kind of cyber operations will be

595
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,390
off the table what kind of cyber

596
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,850
operations will be permissible in other

597
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:37,190
words where does does the law of the

598
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,840
line for legality the line for

599
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,550
lawfulness and unlawfulness lie and

600
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,330
States are not clearly setting out this

601
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,980
threshold for an understandable reason

602
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:51,139
they don't want to tie their own hands

603
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,180
okay they want to leave certain options

604
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,090
on the table so they're just slowly

605
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:59,980
chipping away at the edges but they

606
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:02,449
refrain from drawing those red lines

607
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:08,300
does this present a strategic

608
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:10,580
opportunity for Japan maybe perhaps the

609
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,520
question that is more important in this

610
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,330
audiences how can the technical

611
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,710
community

612
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:20,399
participate in those discussions and

613
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:25,550
should you even do so my answer is that

614
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:28,130
you can for sure and you should for sure

615
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:31,639
why do I say this

616
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:34,530
first you can help your government

617
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:38,010
answer the fundamental question that

618
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:42,450
needs to be answered before developing

619
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:45,920
any legal policy on the issue and that

620
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:51,540
question has to do with whether Japan

621
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:53,220
sees cyberspace as a Wild West are you

622
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,409
dissatisfied with what you're witnessing

623
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,650
in cyberspace

624
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:01,260
are you as the technical community upset

625
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:03,570
with what you're seeing happen in this

626
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,640
domain are you witnessing cyber

627
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,740
operations by other states that you

628
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,030
believe international law should not

629
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:15,800
tolerate so are you seeing cyberspace as

630
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:20,070
a Wild West or you think cyberspace says

631
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:23,190
somewhat chaotic but nevertheless there

632
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,820
is order in this chaos and international

633
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,560
law appears to be working just fine of

634
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,320
course international law just like

635
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,590
domestic law will never succeed in

636
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,080
avoiding all violations

637
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,659
just like violations of the law kurd

638
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,449
domestically violations of the law will

639
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,850
occur internationally but when you look

640
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,900
at the big picture do you say well

641
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:51,209
things are kind of ok and there isn't a

642
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,060
big problem so this is the fundamental

643
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,850
question that Japan and every other

644
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,580
country will need to answer before

645
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,320
developing legal policy and it is a

646
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,520
question that the technical community

647
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,770
can weigh in on if you see cyberspace as

648
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,000
a Wild West then you can use

649
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:15,020
international law to create rules that

650
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,960
would help prevent this type of behavior

651
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:23,100
that you believe should not exist and if

652
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,160
you see cyberspace even in its chaos as

653
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,230
an environment where things are working

654
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,409
pretty well then you can use

655
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:34,200
and direct international law in the

656
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:38,850
direction in order to maintain the

657
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,760
status quo now US techies should you

658
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:46,428
weigh in on those deliberations let me

659
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:51,529
give you a word of advice it was in the

660
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:56,669
1990s in 1996 when John Perry Barlow an

661
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:58,620
American poet and essayist wrote the

662
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:01,080
Declaration of the independence of

663
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,168
cyberspace I'm sure many of you have

664
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,389
read this before and then this

665
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:09,929
declaration some Perry Barlow

666
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:13,949
essentially said that cyberspace should

667
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:16,950
be outside governmental regulation that

668
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:20,428
cyberspace should exist in a regulatory

669
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,299
vacuum because things work well in

670
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,869
cyberspace

671
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,780
so John Perry Barlow he was a cyber

672
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:33,300
libertarian but whether you like it or

673
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:35,970
not those times are over cyberspace is

674
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,849
being subjected to regulation both

675
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:41,578
domestically and internationally and

676
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:45,089
this probably is a good thing rather

677
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:49,619
than a bad thing as our societies depend

678
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:51,810
more and more on cyber capabilities the

679
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,560
risk that comes with this dependence is

680
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:58,740
by definition higher and it is the role

681
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,130
of the law to try to prevent those risks

682
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,319
from materializing the US techies even

683
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,940
if you believe that cyberspace should

684
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:11,520
not be subjected to regulation as a

685
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,650
principled position you should let that

686
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,329
go it doesn't mean that you should

687
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,930
resist regulation that doesn't make

688
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,780
sense

689
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:23,089
but as a general matter regulation is

690
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,089
happening it will continue to happen

691
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,250
what else can you do as the technical

692
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:32,880
community well as the technical

693
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:36,030
community you can help keep house

694
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,060
lawyers can help keep the diplomats can

695
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,790
help keep the policymakers grounded in

696
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,799
technical realities

697
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,980
maybe able to open the terminal on my

698
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,370
MacBook or iMac and I may be able to

699
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,530
find out what my IP address is but

700
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:56,069
that's pretty much the extent of my

701
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:58,680
cyber capabilities so I don't understand

702
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:02,310
cyber very well but if I were a

703
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,129
policymaker I would want to come forward

704
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:08,640
with policy proposals that are sensible

705
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,920
and I might not always see the

706
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,500
foolishness in some of my policy

707
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,910
proposals so I would want to rely upon

708
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,070
you the techies in keeping me honest

709
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:23,970
when it comes to the technical realities

710
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:26,460
so I would like you to tell me what are

711
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,950
you talking about when I come up with a

712
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,160
proposal that doesn't make the slightest

713
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:35,009
bit of sense but I would also want you

714
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,960
to give me a thumbs up if you believe

715
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,540
that I've done a good job and the

716
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,080
regulation that our thought of would

717
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,900
make sense would be a good thing to have

718
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:50,660
in cyberspace and with that positive

719
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,660
note I thank you for your attention

720
00:36:51,880 --> 00:37:00,179
[Applause]
