1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,570
good morning thank you for coming out

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,789
when I when I when I saw the timeslot 9

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,980
a.m. on the second day of the conference

4
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:21,698
I was a little concerned you might all

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,669
be sleeping because I would be if I

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,109
wasn't here giving the talk but I very

7
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:29,890
much appreciate that everyone has come

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:34,270
out and I hopefully I'll give you a fair

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,670
trade for for that effort what we're

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,730
going to talk about today is an attack

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,770
by what I think is one of the most

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,680
sophisticated and dangerous attacker

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,140
groups in cryptocurrency today this

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,410
attack targeted over a dozen

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,070
cryptocurrency companies leveraged to

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,250
Firefox 0 days and a sophisticated suite

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,429
of other efforts to to execute those

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:04,449
attacks we're gonna spend the next 30 to

19
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:06,070
35 minutes breaking down that attack how

20
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:08,289
it happened and highlighting a few

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,869
lessons that we learned along the way in

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,229
how to and what works and what doesn't

23
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:18,009
when defending against zero day attacks

24
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,990
I will leave 5 to 10 minutes at the end

25
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,360
for questions you may have

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,039
soplease during the presentation be

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,210
thinking about questions that you may

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,689
wish to ask I'm happy to say that the

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,579
end of this story is a happy ending that

30
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:36,610
we caught the attack early when it came

31
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,889
our way that no customer or corporate

32
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,500
funds were ever at risk we were able to

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,079
detect responds and contain the attack

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,740
within just a very few minutes and fully

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,250
remediate within within a day or so

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,679
although as will come to understand as I

37
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,630
go through this one of our engineers who

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
was targeted with the phishing email I'm

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,339
not sure he has opened his email since

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,829
then out of out of fear of future

41
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,539
phishing by way of introduction my name

42
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:10,000
is Philip Martin I'm the chief

43
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,670
information security officer at Queen

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,900
base just by show of hands very quickly

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,268
who's who's a herd of coinbase

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,180
if you want one or two great coinbase is

47
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,930
a global crip

48
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:27,349
currency company that currently holds

49
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,409
somewhere somewhere more than 20 billion

50
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:32,719
US dollars worth of digital assets

51
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:36,230
across a global user base we also have

52
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,659
an office here in Tokyo and are in the

53
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,340
process of applying for licensure here

54
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,849
here in Japan as a virtual currency

55
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,060
exchange I've spent my whole career

56
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:49,310
working in security with a mixture of

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,709
experience in the US government settings

58
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,959
and in private sector settings but

59
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:59,450
you're not here to hear about me you're

60
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:01,430
here to hear about the attack we're

61
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,540
gonna start by walking through the

62
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,669
attack break it down into phases and

63
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,929
talk about each phase individually

64
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:15,079
although in in real life I doubt the

65
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:19,489
attacker serialized it in quite the same

66
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:23,450
way we'll cover how and why we detected

67
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:26,000
the attack and as a spoiler alert it was

68
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,159
not magical cyber AI that detected the

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,400
attack it was good process and

70
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,310
procedures good play books good

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,849
tabletops and good cyber hygiene that

72
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,889
resulted in this victory and finally

73
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:42,589
I'll answer your questions what we were

74
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,650
not going to do in this talk is go

75
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,379
through an in-depth malware analysis or

76
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,750
teardown of the malware there's actually

77
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:52,489
a talk later today at one twenty by one

78
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,680
of the gentlemen from the line security

79
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,729
team who will be going a little bit more

80
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,349
into that side of things what I hope you

81
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,939
will learn from this session and what I

82
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,668
hope you will take away and be able to

83
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:06,560
do after this session is learn a little

84
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,639
bit how we prepared ourselves to be

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,079
resistant to this kind of attacker and

86
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,569
be able to think a little bit about in

87
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,780
your context in your threat model and in

88
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,519
your companies how you might be able to

89
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,330
think about these same n't the same

90
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,550
techniques and attackers assuming that

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,250
you have attackers with zero days in

92
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:33,830
your in your threat model with that a

93
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:39,650
quick summary and overview

94
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:42,590
the of the attack so from May until June

95
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,479
approximately of this year an attacker

96
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,289
group conducted a very sophisticated

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:52,310
cyber operation targeting about 200

98
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,530
individuals together that represents

99
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:58,640
over a dozen global cryptocurrency

100
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,799
companies this operation displayed a

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,789
level of sophistication and resourcing

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,390
that is exceptional among actors active

103
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,970
in the cryptocurrency space today it

104
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,950
involved an extensive target selection

105
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,850
and research building that list of 200

106
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,320
people took took a fair bit of time it

107
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,820
involves sophisticated social

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,430
engineering and we'll dive into what

109
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,510
that looked like and finally it involves

110
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:31,700
two very expensive remote Firefox 2-0

111
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:33,640
days we believe the attacker in this

112
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,659
instance has been active since around

113
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,490
2016 mainly targeting cryptocurrency

114
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,170
exchanges we see evidence and we'll go

115
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,720
into this later that this attacker has

116
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,720
been involved in attacks on Japanese

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,570
exchanges on European exchanges and on

118
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,600
American exchanges so they work across

119
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,550
geographical boundaries we've seen

120
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,370
evidence that these attackers have had

121
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:02,360
access to at least six zero days over

122
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,880
those three years although these Firefox

123
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,160
exploits as Firefox zero-days were the

124
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,550
first fully remote Oh days that we think

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,370
we've seen them use so with that

126
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,070
overview let's dive into sort of a phase

127
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,460
by phase review of how these attackers

128
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:24,770
operated and again all I'll caveat this

129
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,719
with while the various tasks here we're

130
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,849
certainly performed by the attackers we

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,760
don't know exactly that they did it in

132
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,040
this order or on this precise timeline

133
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,030
there's a lot of inferences and

134
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,860
assumptions we're making in this so

135
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,890
first phase is the reconnaissance the

136
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,410
recon phase this is the phase that quite

137
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,360
frankly we know the least about of all

138
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,530
the phases because it occurred

139
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,210
sort of entirely external to coinbase we

140
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,599
know that these attackers put together a

141
00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,128
list of about 200 individuals for their

142
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:02,930
initial phishing delivery target set

143
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,479
we know the attackers targeted almost

144
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,879
exclusively personal email addresses so

145
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,919
all they identified individuals at

146
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,659
targeted companies they went to the

147
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,479
further effort of identifying not

148
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:16,430
corporate but personal email addresses

149
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,870
for their malware malware delivery we'll

150
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,509
talk a little bit about that at the end

151
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,240
because it does make the defenders job

152
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,419
much much harder in terms of detecting

153
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,030
that initial delivery of of the social

154
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:30,620
engineering and of the phishing we know

155
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,270
that they did get a few of the targets

156
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,770
very very wrong they were they were

157
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,049
clearly targeting cryptocurrency

158
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,609
companies some of the people on their

159
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,590
target list had nothing to do with

160
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,599
cryptocurrency companies but the vast

161
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,279
majority they got they got very very

162
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,560
right so this is actually a very high

163
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,240
fidelity list that they were able to

164
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,279
assemble they were interested more in IT

165
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,620
infrastructure security and engineering

166
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,750
targets than they were in other targets

167
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,539
overall and we'll see this when we talk

168
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,120
about how they went through their target

169
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,400
selection and how they chose and

170
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,300
eventually who to give who does who do

171
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,068
who to expose to the zero-day what we

172
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,589
don't know is that we is we don't know

173
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:15,319
where or how they did their research our

174
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:17,719
sumption is this is classical open

175
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,839
source intelligence techniques LinkedIn

176
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:22,580
Facebook Twitter or what have you

177
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,169
combined with with you know some

178
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,810
additional good research and follow-up

179
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:29,240
to find those personal email addresses

180
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,589
perhaps via data dumps or other third

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,599
party breaches that they were able to

182
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:38,838
correlate we we don't know how long this

183
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,320
phase took or how far in advance it

184
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,779
happened it may have been something and

185
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,089
this gets back to the timeline here may

186
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,640
be wrong they may have developed the

187
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,380
Firefox capability first and that we had

188
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,029
done the recon after they had the

189
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,420
exploit or the other way around we just

190
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,420
don't know

191
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,920
see the next the next phase once they

192
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,000
develop this list or as I mentioned once

193
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,030
they developed the exploit then

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,460
developed this list they went on to sort

195
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,740
of weaponization right so this this

196
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,230
phase traditionally is where you acquire

197
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,100
the technical capability to execute an

198
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,260
attack and this is a very interesting

199
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,300
phase for this attacker and I'm lumping

200
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,600
two separate things into the

201
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:30,170
weaponization phase in this attack one

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,050
is the the exploit development so so

203
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,750
finding the two Firefox's zero-days but

204
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,020
the second interesting methodology or

205
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,520
interesting piece of this is they

206
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,610
acquired the ability to deliver their

207
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,329
fishing so we'll talk about the exploits

208
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,440
and then we'll talk about or rather I'm

209
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,690
gonna I'm gonna flip that around we're

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,990
gonna talk about the the fishing and

211
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,400
then parent can talk about the exploits

212
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,200
one of the reasons as well see in the

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,089
next phase delivery one of the reasons

214
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,980
this this campaign was so effective and

215
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,520
so difficult to detect was because the

216
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,370
attackers

217
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,180
went to the trouble of acquiring

218
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:14,030
legitimates University email addresses

219
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,689
in order to send their fishing they

220
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,640
actually sent that fishing from two

221
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:23,030
different Cambridge University email

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,250
accounts legitimate Cambridge University

223
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,829
email accounts they hosted much of their

224
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,339
infrastructure on Cambridge University

225
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:34,130
systems so in terms of using IP

226
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,870
reputation lists or email filtering

227
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,310
tools that might filter out lower

228
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,890
reputation or or or lower lifetime

229
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,260
emails none of that would have been

230
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,880
effective against this threat because it

231
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,980
was a legitimate Cambridge domain it was

232
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,939
legitimate Cambridge emails and it was

233
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,890
talking about legitimate Cambridge

234
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,750
topics as we will see so in this phase

235
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,310
they acquired that access now we don't

236
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,470
know if they bought it or if they got it

237
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,030
or if they stoled it somehow or if this

238
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,250
is just a case of account takeover of

239
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,130
the Cambridge systems but at the end of

240
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,190
the day they acquired a very very hard

241
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,439
to detect

242
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,920
a set of tools for delivering and

243
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,270
hosting that that fishing infrastructure

244
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,120
the second thing they did in this phase

245
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,370
is they developed their zero days so I'm

246
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,140
not going to go a full in-depth teardown

247
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,510
of the 2-0 days but I will mention a few

248
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,110
interesting facts about them there were

249
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:32,100
two zero days so one was an exploit cv

250
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,660
2019 11707 that was an exploit and it's

251
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,870
what's called the the JIT the JIT

252
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,240
compiler that allowed the attackers to

253
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,330
escape the webpage and get into the

254
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,550
browser process itself in Firefox the

255
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,260
browser process is separately sandboxed

256
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,990
so even with access to the browser

257
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,420
process you still can't do much on the

258
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:56,060
underlying system they leveraged a

259
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:59,490
second zero day at CVE 20 1911 708 as a

260
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,250
that was a sandbox escape to break out

261
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,770
of the fire fought the sandboxed firefox

262
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,380
process and gain access to the

263
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,449
underlying host they chained these two

264
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,340
exploits together in a very stable away

265
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,130
in our experience we were able to

266
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,140
recover the the zero day as part of our

267
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,150
response and were able to test that out

268
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,290
a number of times it was it's a very

269
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:25,949
very stable easy to use exploit so the

270
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:30,260
first exploit the the the JIT escape was

271
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:32,370
simultaneously ich discovered by a

272
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,090
researcher at Google's Project zero

273
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:40,100
named Samuel gross we were able to share

274
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:43,320
the in the wild exploit with him and

275
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,260
determined together that's their very

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,020
very well the underlying bug is the same

277
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,060
the method of exploitation is very very

278
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,920
different between the two so we believe

279
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,349
the attacker independently discovered

280
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,880
this first O'Day probably through

281
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:05,600
searching for zero days that looked like

282
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:08,100
a few historical similar zero days the

283
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,680
second zero day I think is more

284
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,560
interesting to me because it is a as a

285
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,069
brand new sandbox escape that no one had

286
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,829
ever used or seen before and while the

287
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,870
underlying mechanism that was exploited

288
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,390
to escape the sandbox

289
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,050
been available in Firefox for a very

290
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:30,569
very long time probably years the

291
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,060
specific method that the attackers used

292
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,000
to trigger it had only been possible

293
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,430
since abouts

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,529
that since about the middle of May right

295
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,050
so so what this tells me what I'm

296
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:47,939
inferring from this is that the

297
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:51,420
attackers timeline from bug discovery to

298
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,630
weaponization was somewhere around two

299
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,180
weeks now that is an extremely short

300
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,550
weaponization timeline to go from

301
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,239
initial bug discovery to weaponized

302
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:07,079
exploit shockingly short that speaks of

303
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:11,610
a significant experience in exploit

304
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,490
development and of a for very focused

305
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:18,990
intent on the part of these attackers

306
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,060
now I'm assuming here that the attackers

307
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,860
discovered this exploit it's completely

308
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,469
possible the attackers purchased this

309
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,540
exploit from a group that focuses much

310
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,640
more heavily on exploit development

311
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,680
where a two-week development like a

312
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,220
two-week weaponization lifecycle

313
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,380
might not be as shocking and again it's

314
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,820
it's it's hard for us to say in either

315
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:45,810
direction we can say based on the

316
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,730
structure of the O'Dea code and what it

317
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,099
looked like overall it seemed like the

318
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,500
work of someone who's very experienced

319
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,110
in exploit developments and was reusing

320
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,790
components sort of exploit to exploit

321
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,220
things like rob gadget finders things

322
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:03,120
like that were were nicely sort of

323
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,920
compartmentalized in the code so once

324
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,440
they had the the cambridge access the

325
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,079
O'Day's chained together and their

326
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,450
target list now it's time now things get

327
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,400
interesting and now it's when these

328
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:23,850
attackers are really for the first time

329
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:27,029
intersecting with with with coinbase so

330
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,910
delivery this is my favorite phase

331
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,709
because this is when the attackers start

332
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,000
to send out their spearfishing now as we

333
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,680
mentioned they have this initial target

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,130
list

335
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,620
of about 200 200 email addresses almost

336
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,760
entirely personal email jazz Gmail Yahoo

337
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:48,380
that kind of thing and in this phase

338
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,510
they start from that 200 person list and

339
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,300
conduct and we'll walk through it here

340
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:57,260
in a second conduct a social engineering

341
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,810
campaign designed to determine which of

342
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,779
these two hundred targets were worthy of

343
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,089
that zero day they didn't just sort of

344
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,980
spray and pray and throw at the zero day

345
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,450
at two hundred people they wanted to

346
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,000
make sure that when they delivered it

347
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:14,510
the people they delivered it to would be

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,779
high payoff targets again the speaks of

349
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:22,010
a level of operational sophistication

350
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:26,000
that is perhaps not not uncommon but but

351
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:29,000
certainly makes them stand out among

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,070
among attackers let's see what what did

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,190
what did this what did this spearfishing

354
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,990
look like so this is the this is an

355
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,260
example of the initial contact email

356
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,810
that the attacker sent out there were at

357
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,450
least two variants one using the Adams

358
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,119
prize and one using the Adam Smith prize

359
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,760
which we'll see that version next these

360
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,720
are two real prizes that Cambridge hands

361
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,830
out one is a prize in mathematics one is

362
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,290
a prize in economics they also actually

363
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,200
have external review committees for both

364
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,420
of these prizes these are this is the

365
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,870
completely legitimate if you visit that

366
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,410
link in that first email that does not

367
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:14,958
go to an exploitation page that goes to

368
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:18,160
an informational page that was lifted

369
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,179
off of elsewhere from Cambridge is site

370
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,490
if you see there's an interesting

371
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,010
there's an interesting tidbit in that in

372
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,400
that link what you see in that link is

373
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,530
it doesn't go to a top-level Cambridge

374
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,480
page that's not dub-dub-dub Cambridge

375
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:37,730
dot dot AC gov it's actually going to a

376
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,980
personal workspace right you see that

377
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:46,160
that gh sorry g rh three seven in the

378
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,550
middle of that URL this is the attackers

379
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,100
who

380
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,430
stating their social engineering and

381
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,919
later exploitation infrastructure on a

382
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,640
personal sites feature that Cambridge

383
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:02,720
offers to staff and professors making it

384
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,730
much harder to from a reputation point

385
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,800
of view determine that this is is is bad

386
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,260
the the name if you dig into Gregory

387
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,139
Harris who signed the email there at the

388
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,440
time if you if you dug into that that

389
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,630
person you would find a good backstop

390
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,490
you would find LinkedIn accounts with

391
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,830
the reason with with related experience

392
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,430
a number of connections you would find

393
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,679
all the sort of the the the indicators

394
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,830
that you would expect of a of a real

395
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,800
person right very lot of work went into

396
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,970
that face to backstop an account that

397
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,530
that thoroughly the same thing with Neal

398
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,160
Morris who is the other identity the

399
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:49,550
attackers used to to send to send

400
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
fishing Neal Morris generally sent Adams

401
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,030
prized emails

402
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,370
Gregory Harris generally since Adam

403
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,770
Smith prized emails but there were

404
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,550
exceptions on both sides and again we

405
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,790
see that Adam surprise page hosted on a

406
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:07,820
personal page under the Cambridge domain

407
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:11,060
and again this link was not malicious in

408
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,720
any way no exploitation no additional

409
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:21,860
features nothing other than a copied

410
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:23,390
page from a public Cambridge site now if

411
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,240
you responded to these emails with

412
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,620
something like I'm not an engineer or I

413
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,660
don't know what you're reaching out to

414
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,810
me for the attackers would cease would

415
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:36,680
cease contact pretty much immediately if

416
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:38,540
if you did respond and with with some

417
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,310
other response that made made them think

418
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,720
you weren't interesting maybe you maybe

419
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,290
you're a junior software engineer or

420
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,700
something like that

421
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,740
the attackers would cease contact they

422
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:51,080
just wouldn't wouldn't send you anything

423
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:52,520
else if however you did respond and

424
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,720
reply in a way that made you interesting

425
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,360
to the attacker he would get a follow-up

426
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,830
like this a few days later so

427
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,209
interestingly they didn't automate this

428
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,189
that human was responding to these thing

429
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,410
and doing it on a cadence that made

430
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,150
sense right that felt like you were

431
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,280
talking to another human being somewhere

432
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,030
that was that had a busy life and had

433
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,030
other things to do

434
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,600
finally if at the end of the day the

435
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,240
attackers and and this was this message

436
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,379
only sent to about five people finally

437
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,510
if they knew the day the attackers

438
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:29,610
thought you were worth the zero day he'd

439
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:32,190
get this email now this email so a this

440
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,439
process took between ten days and two

441
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:38,700
weeks for most people to go from initial

442
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,830
contact to of that 200 people in the

443
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,650
initial list to the about five people

444
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,449
that got sort of the final message in in

445
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,910
this scheme

446
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:54,600
and here finally we get the exploitation

447
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:57,930
so that URL was a legitimate copy of the

448
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,540
login page for Cambridge's identity

449
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:05,160
provider their IDP with two small

450
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:06,690
changes the first small change was a

451
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,100
little bit of JavaScript's to make sure

452
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,970
that the person visiting the page

453
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:15,330
matched their target profile right so

454
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,550
they seem to want Firefox on Mac or or

455
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,610
or anything on any other operating

456
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,560
system we didn't see any indication that

457
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,800
this campaign contains non Mac

458
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,780
exploitation but this actor group has

459
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,030
displayed Windows exploitation in the

460
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,290
past so it's possible it was there and

461
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,730
we just didn't do the right thing to

462
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:37,260
trigger it the other thing they added so

463
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,690
if you if you visited the site and you

464
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,370
weren't in their target profile you know

465
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,350
you were visiting from from Firefox and

466
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,659
Windows or whatever you'd see this right

467
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:49,020
browser not supported for please install

468
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,180
supported browser right interestingly

469
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:56,550
when we talked to people who got this

470
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:59,220
far the the at least one of them visited

471
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,840
this in chrome and saw this page and we

472
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,230
asked and and then went on to install

473
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,899
Firefox just so he could be exploited by

474
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,930
this and we asked him at the time why

475
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,580
did you do that what why did you think

476
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,310
that was a good idea and his response to

477
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,679
this was well I figured it was just

478
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,740
an academic institution that was just

479
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,020
broken and so this is just normal this

480
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,540
is this his assumption was this is a

481
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:30,120
university universities are bad at IT so

482
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:31,440
let's just go ahead and do this so the

483
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,870
second change in that page was the

484
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,910
inclusion of the exploitation code so

485
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,969
the the exploit JavaScript was hosted on

486
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,620
a separate site this analytics fit com

487
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,890
domain this was hosted and on

488
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,889
bulletproof hosting in the in Eastern

489
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,980
Europe at the time and it's what

490
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:58,320
actually hosted the the JavaScript that

491
00:22:49,980 --> 00:23:01,260
triggered the O'Day so assuming they

492
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,700
exploit landed the shell code was part

493
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,530
of this exploit which shell outs would

494
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,040
calls Firefox to shell out to curl and

495
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,290
pull down a stage one implant that stage

496
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,750
one implants was a variant of the net

497
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,389
wire family and its primary job seemed

498
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,550
to be reconnaissance so it would stage

499
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:22,500
one would run it would take a snapshot

500
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:24,120
of your local system it would do some

501
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,710
initial credential theft it would grab

502
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,110
SSH keys AWS keys if their their key

503
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,870
store information basic things like that

504
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:37,290
exit rate all of that and then what we

505
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:39,510
observed was a delay after stage one and

506
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,210
what we believe this this indicates is

507
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,190
that stage one reported back gave an

508
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,690
inventory of the system to a control or

509
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,660
somewhere who then made a decision on

510
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:53,190
whether to move forward to stage two or

511
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:56,430
not stage two was a variant of the Mokes

512
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,710
family and this is a much less common

513
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,370
piece of malware than than the net wire

514
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,170
family

515
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,530
the attackers seem to use this as a

516
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,990
full-fledged rat or mode access trojan

517
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:09,330
and we've observed the activity of stage

518
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:12,450
two consistent with direct human control

519
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,360
so our observation of the activity once

520
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:23,040
stage two showed up was sort of fairly

521
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:24,209
unique on a per per target basis as I

522
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,740
mentioned I'm not going to dive like

523
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,880
super deep in to the malware analysis

524
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,380
here there's a lot of articles you can

525
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
find

526
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,090
line that break this down further if

527
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:37,970
you're if you're interested in the in

528
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:40,280
the deep analysis actions on target so

529
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,880
what what is the attacker do once there

530
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,800
once that once they landed on a system

531
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,670
so we also know very little about this

532
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,159
face in our case when the when the when

533
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:55,040
when our employee sort of went through

534
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,820
this process and guys got exploited and

535
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,860
had his system exploited we responded

536
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,770
within about twenty minutes of that

537
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,120
initial exploitation so we don't

538
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,100
actually know what they would have done

539
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:12,070
with a longer with a longer window on

540
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:15,139
this system we can infer things based on

541
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,790
reports from previous exploitation that

542
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,210
would encourage you all if you're

543
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:22,129
interested in this actor to go and read

544
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,390
that's their ultimate goal here was to

545
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,370
get in a position to steal

546
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,410
cryptocurrency so they would have gone

547
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,870
into a longer internal reconnaissance

548
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,970
phase looked around evaluated systems

549
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,530
and evaluated sort of a path towards

550
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:38,210
being a sex the access to cryptocurrency

551
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,330
I will notice I will note one

552
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,010
interesting thing that we saw which is

553
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:47,330
the attackers as I mentioned in in stage

554
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:49,220
one for the for the malware seemed to do

555
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,480
a fairly basic automated credential

556
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,640
pillage in stage two we saw some

557
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,180
evidence that they attack that they that

558
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,120
they went after browser credential

559
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:06,050
stores session tokens stored passwords

560
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:09,919
that kind of thing and we saw we saw

561
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:12,950
evidence that they were interested in

562
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,650
pivoting from the local machine into

563
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,040
cloud systems which is an interesting

564
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:21,890
and I think not super common TTP that

565
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:25,639
the attacker lands on a system inside of

566
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:28,910
a enterprise and chooses to go from

567
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:35,150
there to the SAS applications that that

568
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:37,580
enterprise uses there so that's

569
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:40,700
including email file storage things like

570
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,299
that there's some interesting and I'll

571
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,049
mention the

572
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,629
details there's some interesting

573
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,460
Japanese language reporting on these

574
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:49,129
attackers at well that goes into much

575
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:54,379
more additional depth on on some other

576
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:57,469
previous activities so let's talk about

577
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:59,928
the attacker a little bit as I mentioned

578
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:04,190
we believe that they were active since

579
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:07,100
26 a been active since 20 2016 they're

580
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,759
not covered by any threat intelligence

581
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:14,119
firm we're aware of most of them are

582
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:16,220
treating this this actor as some sort of

583
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,320
like unconfirmed activity they're not

584
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:23,769
named by any other by any threat

585
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:26,480
intelligence firm that we know about the

586
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:28,220
there's almost no English language

587
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,840
reporting on this group there is some

588
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,690
Polish language reporting and there's

589
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,730
some Japanese language reporting from

590
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:39,499
the from the from Japan's cyber

591
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:42,379
emergency center but very very little

592
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:45,259
u.s. language reporting this is one of

593
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:47,149
the things that we were trying to fix by

594
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:48,529
releasing the attack details in the way

595
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:50,539
we did was to create more awareness

596
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:52,909
about around this attacker group and

597
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:55,789
their their TTP is their techniques

598
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:57,230
tactics and procedures we believe this

599
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:01,070
is the same actor that breached clean

600
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:03,169
check so the coin check breach was

601
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,689
investigated by a number of parties the

602
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:08,769
the the Japan cyber emergency center

603
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,840
released a report that reports is

604
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:14,359
displays significant overlap with the

605
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,908
with the techniques tactics procedures

606
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,580
as well as the malware families and

607
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:22,039
command control hosts that are attacker

608
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:26,539
used in this in this attack so we assess

609
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:28,970
that the same actor underneath as I

610
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:32,929
mentioned we've seen they have sent at

611
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,299
least half a dozen zero-days across the

612
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:39,139
various attacks so this is a very well

613
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:42,408
resourced actor or a very experienced

614
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:44,689
zero-day or with an attacker with a very

615
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:48,470
experienced a zero-day research team it

616
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:51,919
could go out of their direction these

617
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,220
the the firefox zero-days were the first

618
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,530
fully remote zero day

619
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,840
that we've seen this attacker deploy but

620
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,500
I doubt they will be the last zero days

621
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,120
that we will see this attacker deploy

622
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,160
additionally we have not seen this

623
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,560
attacker active outside cryptocurrency

624
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,040
or if they have been there using

625
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,470
different tools and different tactics

626
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,770
that we're that that we cannot link back

627
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:22,990
to our the attacker group in this attack

628
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:25,360
in this attacker let's talk about so our

629
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,190
response some of our lessons learned and

630
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,590
some of the things that you all might be

631
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,660
able to take away if you're worried

632
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:36,820
about attackers of this of this

633
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:39,310
capability so first the first thing that

634
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:43,149
that validated one of our approaches I

635
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:45,070
will say is that visibility is king when

636
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,010
we're talking about detection and

637
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,750
response right the the are times

638
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,580
detected as I mentioned it was twenty

639
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,580
minutes really are actually that's our

640
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,139
time to in terms of engage and engage

641
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,600
the time to detect was basically instant

642
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:02,260
and that was the case because we

643
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,350
internally at coinbase

644
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,140
are heavily focused on ensuring that we

645
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:12,310
have complete coverage in our security

646
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,620
telemetry and endpoint security tools we

647
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:17,919
are we are fanatical about it

648
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:24,399
because what you aren't what you weren't

649
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:27,970
watching you can't defend to we're also

650
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:32,020
fanatical about about alert quality we

651
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:35,380
we believe strongly in the concept of

652
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:38,410
alert fatigue that is that analysts who

653
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,140
get a lot of alerts from a system starts

654
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,090
to lose trust in that system and do not

655
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,720
engage with that system when it sends

656
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:50,620
you alerts because of that we focus very

657
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,500
heavily on the concept of the alerts

658
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,810
that our analysts and engineers receive

659
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,580
should be high quality should be

660
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:03,179
actionable and should be this is a very

661
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,550
amorphous term but should be interesting

662
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,610
right there they shouldn't be seeing

663
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,320
trivial things come

664
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,899
from an alerting pipeline trivial things

665
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,870
should be dealt with by a machine or by

666
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,760
a computer they should be seeing things

667
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,340
that a human being needs to action or

668
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,740
think about in some way so they stay

669
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,840
engaged with these alerts and stay

670
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,750
responsive when they receive the alerts

671
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,030
this is why while our time to to alert

672
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,190
where to alert was basically instant our

673
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:35,470
time to engage was twenty minutes

674
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:39,890
because our engineers trust our alerts

675
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:42,169
now time to engage twenty minutes time

676
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,330
to recovery under a day that's also

677
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:46,690
quite short why what what led to that

678
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,449
what can you take away here number one

679
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,919
we practice I have a I don't know how

680
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,280
well this is gonna translate into

681
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,620
Japanese but the standard I use for this

682
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,649
and I encourage our team is to think

683
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,370
about is if you can't do it drunk at

684
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,940
three o'clock

685
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,120
Christmas morning you can't do it all

686
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,110
right

687
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,290
have no idea if that translates well but

688
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:15,709
in other words practice so that the

689
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:18,770
response becomes ingrained right muscle

690
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,870
memory if you will do that through the

691
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,510
use of play books do that through the

692
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:25,790
use of tabletops do that through the use

693
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,320
of red teams and internal assessments

694
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:30,918
that are there are no notice they're

695
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,450
surprised red teams so that when your

696
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,760
account when you encounter a real-life

697
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:39,190
situation well you may not have

698
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,870
responded to the exact parameters before

699
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,299
you know your tools you know your

700
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:51,290
processes and you trust your teammates

701
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:57,650
to execute on that mission last the

702
00:32:51,290 --> 00:33:01,690
thing I will I will reimburse eyes is

703
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:05,270
that if you're in cryptocurrency or if

704
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:08,419
you or are a vendor with significant

705
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:10,700
access to a cryptocurrency company zero

706
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:13,850
days are in your threat model even if

707
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:18,890
you thought they weren't before you have

708
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:20,770
to plan for the the to lose the initial

709
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,240
battle when you

710
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,950
planning for zero days there's a famous

711
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,040
Mike Tyson quote that I like a lot in

712
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:30,550
this case that is everyone has a plan

713
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,620
until they get punched in the face right

714
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,930
and then it's all about where do you go

715
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,770
from there what a zero day in your

716
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:41,260
threat model means is you cannot avoid

717
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,980
that first punch in the face you have to

718
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:49,470
accept it and be able to respond to it

719
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,470
at the time of the attackers choosing

720
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,290
with that and five minutes left

721
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,700
I would I would love to take your

722
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,930
questions

723
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,850
if there are any out there and let me

724
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:06,730
just get this earpiece in for any

725
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:09,330
questions in Japanese hey any of those

726
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,330
image that
