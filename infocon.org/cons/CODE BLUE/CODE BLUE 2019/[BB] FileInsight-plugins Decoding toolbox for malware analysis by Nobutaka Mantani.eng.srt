00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:14,070
okay it's sad welcome to Kota blue

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:19,529
welcome to Blue Book and welcome to my

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:22,850
talk I'm not a commentary I introduce my

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:27,050
marvelous to pirate Expo dreams

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:32,390
according to the box for Mary ownership

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:36,570
advanced let me introduce myself

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm I work for national poison agency of

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:45,350
Japan I'm a manager of a small it's a

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,329
talent development team and I was a

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,770
Maria analyst and teacher French

11
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,800
Connery's in the past and I'm also happy

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,520
programmer interning programming on

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:04,949
weekends I being a rainbow previously

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,990
project since 2001 for 18 years and I

15
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,990
love the thought software

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,280
participant means it's a friction of

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,689
provides for mock references effects

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,790
editor it has 16 stable probably ravines

19
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:29,520
many problems all programs I developed

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:34,560
and it's useful for various kinds of

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:40,949
decoding in mario energy development

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:43,770
started in 2012 seven years ago it is

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,549
our private project and developed at

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:52,399
home so it's not a product of Japanese

25
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:55,890
government it is the important point and

26
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,520
it's ravines it's available at my kid

27
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,520
huh bleep you Tori

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:08,399
I'm directly explained background

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:11,700
attackers obfuscated but is data in

30
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,750
barrier to hamper ownership and fight

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,750
their Indian such as imitating

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,550
executable file decoy documents see the

33
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:28,770
host names file path and code it server

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:33,010
all itself and Mario analysts have to do

35
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,459
the open state attempt of other nurses

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:40,019
[Music]

37
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:45,150
and motivation of development at the

38
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:49,890
beginning in 2012 I was a warrior

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,550
analyst in in the government security

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:58,980
operation coordination team called T

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:02,250
sock at the time vulnerabilities of

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,518
Microsoft Office sometimes we are people

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,250
Albatros prayin and other media were

44
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:15,260
frequently used for malaria infection

45
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:18,510
I can such kind of vices document

46
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,200
sometimes it is quite cold did not work

47
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:26,850
in dynamic analysis did you target

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,420
bathroom it's much I had to find the

49
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,420
correct buzzer

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,840
make exploit old work but it is very

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:40,810
time-consuming task oh I wanted to

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,690
manual extraction obfuscated tomaría if

53
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,750
the Kilda profiles from Martius document

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:52,120
the points see the host names and

55
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:55,660
proclaim earlier but correct motivator a

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,380
big change in the dead

57
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:06,940
I just want more more MORE

58
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:10,359
papa free exceeded pretty important and

59
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,690
I'll try to explain fire inside well

60
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,810
what will not for we are with it funny

61
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,500
that is a free hex editor developed by

62
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:25,260
Murphy it was useful meeting functions

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:29,950
to take orders xat T disassembler

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:34,450
remarks structure we're and scripting it

65
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:41,890
also have unique feature that is

66
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:49,990
extendable with final problems but it

67
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:50,669
has being no update since 2009 about 10

68
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,090
years

69
00:04:50,670 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm 43 it has been disappeared from the

70
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:04,750
McAfee return website oh my goodness

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,410
however historian of fine insight is

72
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:12,370
thin available at this location

73
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:16,630
I'm not a share of the future on 5 5

74
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,860
isn't now let's see the details of

75
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,860
appearances Perrine's

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,580
so there are many proteins these

77
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,160
proteins categorized into eight

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:37,330
operation categories such as basic

79
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:44,680
compression crypto encoding meat passing

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:47,948
Asajj Amex or visa added support over

81
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,850
algorithms and formats many many

82
00:05:47,949 --> 00:06:01,870
algorithms and formats supported by my

83
00:05:51,850 --> 00:06:05,050
proteins and all data added functions by

84
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:09,600
my province such as hospital calculation

85
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:13,440
fire type detection finding if it advice

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,710
starting with regular expressions

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,889
opening theater with the Castella tools

88
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:24,370
elitist customizable and find competence

89
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:30,970
caring with generals and war many

90
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:34,120
functions regarding East region by

91
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,940
region from means requires x86 version

92
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,050
of Python tool and it is not compatible

93
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:46,810
with executive x64 version of Python 2

94
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:50,970
and PI 2 3 but vitamin Python 3 can

95
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:54,310
co-exist read for other instruction

96
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:57,580
written in read meaning of very sad

97
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:04,840
proteins and it also requires some

98
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:08,680
Python modules and so on step 2 is

99
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:12,310
treasure it very simple please copy the

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,810
problem folder into final set of order

101
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,810
under the document folder

102
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,570
how do you use

103
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:27,500
please click per category from the

104
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:34,520
plugins tab immediate which will be

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:37,460
appeared take stricter provi you can

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,780
also use praveen's

107
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,780
from from the right-click menu

108
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,560
I've tried to mention finally fessed

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,539
ravines a good friend

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,020
cyber share any user profiles fellowship

111
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,040
yeah thank you

112
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,560
yes I have a shape it is super powerful

113
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,920
decoding it works

114
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,350
oh brother we brothers and inductively

115
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,760
developed by British government TCH here

116
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:13,100
are the many developers involved it is

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,860
very good that much processing of the

118
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,610
coding but not good that the modified 18

119
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:25,430
so fine in tightened by inside problem

120
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:29,300
here the authorities on cyber sharing

121
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,990
and thus able to probe in job can turn

122
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:36,460
up straight into theta to cyber shape

123
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:41,919
job title you get up to take it apart

124
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:50,750
I've installed the demo our beta yeah

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:55,069
it's Tim time I prepared five devil the

126
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:58,880
first demo is a versus Microsoft Excel

127
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:02,630
file my buried into the mobile give him

128
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:07,160
a minute and confiscated with XOR and

129
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,530
bit rotate under this from is exotic is

130
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,439
such fine to be unified and seemed to

131
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,439
Praveen to equal the merrier

132
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:42,779
yeah and it is a container excel file

133
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:48,098
now let's see that the end of file yeah

134
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:55,169
did it feel suspicious barrier and i-89

135
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:55,169
a try a try a try sometimes if

136
00:09:55,469 --> 00:10:04,869
executable files is encoded with XOR

137
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:10,409
it's g8o files it's filled with extra

138
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:16,989
key so it seems to be our X okey now

139
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:26,339
let's use the brute-force attack to take

140
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:33,009
over dinner repeat such operations

141
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:38,279
exotic search and I enter that vicious

142
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,279
dream physique to indicate applying G's

143
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:42,989
each program

144
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:10,970
yeah without admission yeah

145
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:15,739
theta ik sake under our feet to rotate

146
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:18,110
and such kids eat a biscuit this program

147
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:22,100
cannot be run in DOS mode it was basic

148
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:27,950
to be a photographer so not now let the

149
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:38,450
because of with is key funny that has be

150
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:48,720
doing feature X for about another X 48

151
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:54,180
line because then bit rotate with

152
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:59,610
by weeks and such it God

153
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:05,250
look marked here now you can see the PE

154
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:11,370
header you can see the string this

155
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:15,090
program cannot be run in DOS mode then

156
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:19,050
my extract is probably the executable

157
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:24,750
file with punching operations find

158
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:30,979
people to be executable file found at

159
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:35,790
this top teeth of same content over the

160
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:41,940
original files bookmarks so you can

161
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:46,140
select eject the fire I use I strike two

162
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:54,950
other aspiring either so are you to beat

163
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:54,949
corporations tend to think I'd agree

164
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,740
I can derive this clarify with either

165
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:10,470
the past past devil

166
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,149
the second demo

167
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,960
secondary there are rich merchants of

168
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,550

[Music]

170
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:30,680
miss Maria its Maria executable file is

171
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:34,170
emitted and obfuscated with X or Y

172
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:40,649
incrementing X Hakeem is called rolling

173
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:45,839
X or they call this sample I use the

174
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:50,820
propane for the guest 2010 256-byte EXO

175
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:56,970
keys I use this Praveen because if you

176
00:13:50,820 --> 00:14:02,630
use drawing XOR sometimes a cyclic 202

177
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:05,630
sick stick 56 bite patterns are you

178
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,630
disturbing

179
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,220
[Music]

180
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:26,150
yeah this is the content of all the rich

181
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:30,410
text file here

182
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:41,240
there are even suspicious fiery data

183
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:45,500
attached in heck view the content

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,640
derived right did now let's see the day

185
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,640
the end of the fire

186
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,430
you can see the white butter

187
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,499
[Music]

188
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:21,880
you can see the bottom there are 1 2 3 4

189
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,220
5 6 7 like this so X of G value is

190
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,439
incremented

191
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:36,010
now let's start a indicative of our I

192
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:45,399
use X operations gets to 256 by ticks

193
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:50,140
Aki's yeah the candidate of extra keys

194
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,980
has been shown and wincenty to the

195
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:56,829
unifier found out this offset and a

196
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:01,149
little compartment hater found us this

197
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:06,130
off-trail saved for the morning

198
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:11,170
Geoffrey's just copy like XO key then

199
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:18,779
select all the content then paste the

200
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,779
code XO key then the goal

201
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:33,990
yeah you can see the B hitter so you can

202
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:36,350
extract this Mario 5 it is the second

203
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,350
demo

204
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:52,230
okay saturdaya start level either PHP

205
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:56,969
will share the code really obfuscated

206
00:16:52,230 --> 00:17:02,070
with base 64 L'Occitane defrayed and so

207
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:09,270
on and these protein project ravines we

208
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:13,070
use low 30s order custom based 64 the

209
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,069
board growing plain and simple

210
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,079
[Music]

211
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:37,130
yeah it is the content of the PHP code

212
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:42,320
the code is obfuscated with the PHP

213
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:46,970
functions like this now I'm going to

214
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:58,149
because this for this code wipe one by

215
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:58,150
one now and select the encoded string

216
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:17,889
execute not something rubbings and

217
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:23,279
coding operations not studying the Greek

218
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:23,279
okay decode it then

219
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:32,218
give us the order based on this function

220
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:41,259
basic operations be bisoder

221
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:46,989
and base64 big conflict encoding

222
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:50,009
operations custom page 64 the code if

223
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:57,909
you don't modify each table it works a

224
00:18:50,009 --> 00:19:01,749
normal basic base 64 taken now they call

225
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:05,320
it then each data too compressed to

226
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:11,859
accomplish I'm going to compress this

227
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:19,269
data with compressed operations low in

228
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:22,289
fridge yeah you can see another take it

229
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,289
encoded data

230
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:37,570
and I opened this data in Newton basic

231
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:42,120
operations open a new file and it is

232
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:52,559
encoded in base64 then seeded inference

233
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:52,559
now I copy the data selected the data

234
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:02,530
encoding operations at a basic three

235
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:12,900
ball decode and this is the compressed

236
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:12,899
data then compressed operations no wait

237
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:26,299
yes it is decoded PHP code now it's

238
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:32,330
aligned with this bitch pre-code with

239
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:39,469
external tools takes the data bits

240
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:42,499
corporations tend to be as tall so you

241
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:47,320
can see it PHP code with be just as you

242
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:56,349
call so you can do further analysis or

243
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:56,349
is PHP for ya that's our table

244
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:19,169
yeah next for stable the embassy Mar

245
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:23,340
where it is used by a psychotic group

246
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:26,509
evidene 28 also known as fancy beer it

247
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:31,590
uses some tickets of dreams

248
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:36,659
they are encoded as a ecstasy I extract

249
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:43,259
and take out in extremes under based on

250
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:47,730
these extremes I scan with general based

251
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:52,159
on its train so in this demo I use

252
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,159
strain scrubbing and the a scam Praveen

253
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:19,060
yeah it is not content all of the

254
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:27,610
verified I use the propane passing

255
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:32,230
operations strength strength shows with

256
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:36,520
this sitting dialogue dog I increase the

257
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:42,910
minimum language duty I select the post

258
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:45,600
process to remove duplicates unable this

259
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:51,970
checkbox they called hex encoded

260
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:55,360
extremes they click OK so these are

261
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:59,800
extracted piece of string and decoded

262
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:04,149
string will be shown like this decoded

263
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:11,639
and original so I will search I'm going

264
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:17,530
to search the cottage string yeah

265
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:23,680
these are decoded extremes a visa some

266
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:29,639
entities swing dot top cakes question ID

267
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:32,910
name enter password to open file

268
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,910
Microsoft Word

269
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,960
these specific strings and can be used

270
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,630
to create

271
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:47,610
yaarun now

272
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:54,450
I already prepared the general based on

273
00:23:47,610 --> 00:24:01,580
these strings this is Yahoo watching

274
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:01,580
this picks X ticket then

275
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,740
let's scan with this Yahoo

276
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:26,930
such operations Ellis can then dialogue

277
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:31,170
shall be shown so you you should direct

278
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,980
fire to be scanned the general fire for

279
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:37,860
effect

280
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:42,990
de Rossi totally take Rick okay yeah

281
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:49,020
scanning without admission it's so hot

282
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:52,370
strings have been matched in in under

283
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:57,210
Angela offset the match

284
00:24:52,370 --> 00:25:01,739
much the strings will be highlighted as

285
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:04,970
a bookmark so you can see photo stream

286
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:11,790
you have been matched with your general

287
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:16,440
so file inside can use the are you

288
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:21,379
testing to and general editor it is very

289
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,380
useful a digital force demo

290
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:39,790
the last day this demo it did not Mario

291
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:43,780
file but it is a binary file that

292
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:48,100
contains the hidden method it is a it is

293
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:51,160
like a very easy City shift like

294
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:54,879
challenge I'm going to solve the

295
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:58,720
combination with cyber safe and I am

296
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:02,430
going to use this Praveen file type XV

297
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,430
decompress something to

298
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:30,220
yeah and it is magnified

299
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:33,680
I used passing operations file type

300
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:45,070
yeah file type is actually compressed

301
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:49,010
data now I use compressed operations

302
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:53,600
Exley's able to compress the file has

303
00:26:49,010 --> 00:27:02,690
been they compressed and I use file type

304
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:15,860
driving again it is pink image data it's

305
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:22,190
this image tend to mspaint yeah it is

306
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:26,300
- Nicole now let you the cyber safe to

307
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:34,910
take all disk your goal miss cooperation

308
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:37,580
send to cyber chef automatically the

309
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,160
reporter brother have been executed and

310
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:44,240
the data will be imported

311
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:50,050
it is a very important data select the

312
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,050
recipe data image

313
00:27:50,260 --> 00:28:02,200
they also have to be shown then passed

314
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:05,500
to alcohol yeah

315
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,090
it is the secret message thank you for

316
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:20,890
eating my toad

317
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:26,020
I'm ready to enjoy convert 2009 learn

318
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:29,110
about wine it has proteins make fire

319
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:33,610
effects in hex editor more perform like

320
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:36,939
animal suits and it is very useful for

321
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,629
various kind of decoding task a task in

322
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:44,740
mario energy it is available after this

323
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:47,350
by github repository please download and

324
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,059
try it and I am waiting for your

pluralist bug report and feature

327
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:59,530
requests thank you so much it's a

328
