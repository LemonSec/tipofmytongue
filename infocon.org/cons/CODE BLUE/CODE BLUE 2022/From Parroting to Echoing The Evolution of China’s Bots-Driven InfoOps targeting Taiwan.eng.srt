1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,520

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,460
the title of our talk today is

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,220
um from parroting to echoing the

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,560
evolution of China's bots-driven

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,538
involves targeting Taiwan

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,720
yeah so before we go into the talks I'll

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,460
give a brief introduction about

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,700
ourselves so my name is Sylvia and I'm a

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,960
cyberstar analyst from Team T5 and then

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,420
I research apte State nation state

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,180
actors and info apps in the Apec region

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,840
and then my co-speaker church Hun he is

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,539
also a cyber third analyst from Team T5

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,360
yeah and then he has been researching

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,820
Chinese cyber crime underground markets

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,539
as well as involves so previously we

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,600
have been giving talks at International

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,619
cyber security conferences

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,840
um so here's the outlines for today's

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
talk so in the first part I'm going I'm

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,580
going to give some um background

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,080
information and our previous observation

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,939
regarding China and access bot networks

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,640
and then in the second part I'm going to

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,780
elaborate on the Nuance changes in the

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,979
ttps used by this bot networks and then

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,540
in the third part

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,720
um chur will elaborate the changes in

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,920
TTP and by using uh an operation

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,560
targeting Taiwan in this year and then

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
for the last part we will share our

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,020
assessment and our Outlook regarding

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,880
this type of activities

38
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,540
so um because there's a lot of

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,820
challenges and difficulties in

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,220
researching the issue of this

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,920
information or influence campaign and

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,899
one of them is how to differentiate

43
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,900
nation-state operation from other

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,840
regular PR marketing activity because we

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,800
know now the politician they tend to use

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,620
this kind of

47
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,120
marketing strategy on social media

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,220
platforms so there's a lot of noises

49
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,060
information chaos but then we still can

50
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,360
observe there are some signs that

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,379
there's maybe Nation say operation in

52
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,300
this social media platform yeah so um we

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,700
try to use a cyber threat intelligence

54
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,860
mindset which means that we will try to

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,440
analyze the actor and to make a more

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,620
precise attribution by looking at their

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,400
infra their ttps by using the diamond

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,680
model

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
so background information

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
so um previous observation has a lot of

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,659
research already pointed out actually

62
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,959
this Chinese

63
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
Affiliated networks they actually have

64
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,599
limited influence and no organic

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,080
engagement according to the data and

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,159
reports published by Twitter or Google

67
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,519
so the finding actual uh in fact was

68
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,220
aligned with our observation and then

69
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,739
the content they have been posting is

70
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,920
just a mechanical parroting of the

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,040
contents of Chinese State media Outlet

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,480
but then

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,980
um it is really interesting because

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,239
although

75
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,700
um the the influence is limited and then

76
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,040
no one actually watched this kind of

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,560
content we still see um the operation

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,760
remain persistent for years and then

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,560
although the platforms have been giving

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,379
efforts to remove these spot networks

81
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,799
but then we still see a new Bots spawn

82
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,200
within a short period of time in

83
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,799
response to current affairs so one of

84
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,978
the notable case is this spamoflash

85
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,358
network disclosed by Graphica so um this

86
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,880
the spamoflash network has been

87
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
president

88
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,419
exists for more than two years yeah

89
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,540
so here's the screenshot to show you um

90
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,139
the a sense of how they

91
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:37,740
um

92
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,740
the mechanical parroting of this account

93
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,160
so you can see the profile photo of this

94
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
account they just use headshots so it's

95
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,820
really not a sophisticated kind of

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,340
content

97
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,919
and then here's this another example of

98
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,680
the influence operation where they try

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,100
to mobilize a protest in the United

100
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,860
States against a Chinese scientist

101
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,840
called Dr Lee Min yen

102
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,100
and then here's also another example

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,340
where they try to Target the

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,860
pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong

105
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,900
and then in the comment section you can

106
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
also see

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,460
um the Bots account posting a very stiff

108
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,280
kind of content so um from the first

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,539
site you

110
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,300
um even regular people can recognize

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,360
that these kind of comments is not

112
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,000
actually made by authentic user

113
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,759
so from parenting to echoing how they

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
are trying to improve their ttps using

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,560
the automated mechanism

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,300
so first

117
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,180
um in this year we observed that they

118
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,639
have started to hijack

119
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,240
um pro-democracy narratives so they will

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,060
first post that conspiracy theory and

121
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,780
disinformation on blocks and forums such

122
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,020
as Tumblr open diary patreon we believe

123
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,060
the reason why they did this first is

124
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,520
that it can create a false appearance

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,460
that the content is being echoed over

126
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,539
cyberspace and second is that this kind

127
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,639
of controversial content on Tumblr and

128
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,900
patreon open diary it is it will not be

129
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
easily been removed by the platform

130
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,400
and then we have C that um this the

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,120
actors they have impersonated

132
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,280
these pro-democracy

133
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,180
um groups including multi-alliance and

134
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,479
Safeguard Defenders so multi-alliance as

135
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,539
you already you know it is a very famous

136
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,960
online human rights movement and then

137
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,780
Safeguard Defender is a pen Asian human

138
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,600
rights NGO and another interesting

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,259
victim is intrusion truth which is an

140
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,380
anonymous group that has been exposing

141
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,600
Chinese apt activity for years

142
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,639
so um this table summarize the

143
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,300
activities of this bot networks so first

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,160
is the impersonation of milk tea

145
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
Alliance and then the operation started

146
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,259
in 2022 February and it lasted for about

147
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,500
three months so in this operation they

148
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,840
have used the name of milk tea Alliance

149
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,860
to publish a report to amplify a very

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,699
famous covid-19 origin conspiracy theory

151
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,419
saying that the virus actually came from

152
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,599
a U.S lab car for That Trick

153
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,380
and then the second case is when the

154
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,139
Safeguard Defender the NGO they publish

155
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,500
a report on how China has been

156
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,099
establishing a police agency overseas

157
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,800
like in North America and Europe and to

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,240
try to coerce those dissidents oversee

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,900
dissident back to China and then these

160
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,599
spot networks they started to

161
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
um that disguise themselves as the

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,520
accounts of Safeguard Defenders and

163
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,179
posted the article with same title but

164
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,599
the content has been changed to

165
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,219
pro-chinese police content

166
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,659
yeah

167
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,880
um and then the last one um is the most

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,160
interesting part so the last one

169
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,899
actually started

170
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,000
um in uh 2022 July and that is when the

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,019
time um the Chinese Authority started to

172
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:02,279
accuse the US NSA of attacking the

173
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,760
Chinese research university called

174
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,100
Northwestern polytechnical University

175
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,420
so um after that we see that there's a

176
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,860
bunch of Bot accounts started to post it

177
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,800
a lot of content hijacking the hashtag

178
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,019
of apt-41 and said that apd-41 is funded

179
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,420
by the US government and it is operated

180
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,660
by nsatio

181
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,459
and then

182
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,480
um so the operation is actually ongoing

183
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,200
so if you go to Twitter right now and

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,320
search for hashtag apd41 you might also

185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,540
able to see some of the accounts still

186
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,500
exist yeah although Twitter has

187
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,060
continued to remove this kind of content

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,160
and account every day but still yeah

189
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,120
so um this is the screenshot of the

190
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,440
conspiracy theory Amplified by the

191
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,200
actors disguising themselves as the milk

192
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,620
tea Alliance so the content has been

193
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,160
distributed in this forums so you can

194
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,339
see that actually the content is posted

195
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,080
on this forum that is used by maybe some

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,779
oversea Chinese in Southeast Asian

197
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,339
countries or the Chinese diaspora in the

198
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,839
North American region yeah and also the

199
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
target of the victim also appears in

200
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,899
like Japan Russia and other countries

201
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,380
yeah

202
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,079
so um from the photos found in the

203
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,880
article we found that the art style

204
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,740
actually aligns with the political or

205
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,980
cartoon used by Chinese tabloids like

206
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,220
Global times so um although there's no

207
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,500
solid evidence but it is possible that

208
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,959
they are made by the same artists

209
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,320
and then here is the screenshot of how

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,060
this bot account they posted the

211
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,480
contents on Vimeo YouTube and Tumblr and

212
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,940
then they will share the content from

213
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,040
those link and posted it on Twitter

214
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,279
yeah so um another thing is that this

215
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
bot account they are actually

216
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,920
um if they are not uh removed by Twitter

217
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,740
or those social media platform we see

218
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,200
that they have been repeatedly used in

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,839
different kind of operation so the same

220
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,019
set of account there's a narrative

221
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,860
overlap so in in previous operation they

222
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,760
might be used in influence campaign and

223
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,260
focusing on Taiwan issue or xinjiang or

224
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,260
attacking journalists or there's overlap

225
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,680
with operation Dragon Bridge which which

226
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,040
is a operation targeting the Linus Rare

227
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,279
Earth company and then also there's

228
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,980
overlap with previous influence campaign

229
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,940
attacking the Chinese businessmen Gray

230
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,160
so it is really fascinating because we

231
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,100
also see that the youths are really

232
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,399
um hard to understand kind of tactics

233
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,620
they were you they will post this kind

234
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,060
of content

235
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,339
um in screenshot and then post it in on

236
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,360
Twitter and YouTube

237
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,279
and then this is what I mean by share

238
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,620
infra you can see that

239
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,860
um the same account was used to post

240
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,980
that videos asking president Tsai

241
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,700
England to surrender during U.S speaker

242
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,940
Nancy Pelosi visits to Taiwan and then

243
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,459
at the same account was used to post it

244
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,940
the pro Chinese police content and then

245
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,920
on the left screenshot you can even see

246
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,860
they made a really stupid mistake by

247
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,899
using the title of

248
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:10,579
um

249
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,680
regarding the Chinese Palace narratives

250
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,560
but then the content of the video is

251
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,700
actually related to xinjiang issue

252
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,139
yeah

253
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,380
so here is another example of how these

254
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,440
accounts have been repeatedly used to

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,380
amplify a narrative that is in favor

256
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,180
with the Chinese government

257
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,760
and then here is the operation

258
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,459
um impersonating intrusion truth on on

259
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,440
the left right hand side you can see

260
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,320
that is the official account of

261
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,060
intrusion truth and on the right hand

262
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,540
side you can see how they try to spoof

263
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,019
the social media handle of intrusion

264
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,760
truth

265
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,120
and then we found that they have

266
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,760
registered hundreds of similar account

267
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,420
on Twitter

268
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,240
and the content they posted is a little

269
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,300
bit more sophisticated compared to what

270
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,940
I have shown just now for example on the

271
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,160
left hand side you can see that they

272
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,940
claim fire intelligence release a report

273
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,959
detailing apd-41 is apt group funded by

274
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,360
the US government and on the right hand

275
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,420
side you can see that they share an

276
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,240
article from CNN and the article

277
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,320
actually cites a quote from the former

278
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,040
director of NSA but they hijacked the

279
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,399
narrative by saying that by adding the

280
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,180
hashtag of apt-41

281
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,300
but but in fact the article was posted

282
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,300
in 2016 and it has it does not relate to

283
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,800
what the statement this kind of Bot

284
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,300
accounts are trying to claim

285
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,440
so we believe

286
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,720
um the possible trigger point of the

287
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,060
attacks against intrusion tooth may be

288
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,180
the article um they posted

289
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,139
um back in July where they um posted an

290
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,160
article

291
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,860
um illustrating the interconnectivity of

292
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,100
apd-41 and other Chinese hacker

293
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,300
community

294
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,720
so the interesting thing is again they

295
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,300
have hijacked the this article and then

296
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,519
from the left hand side you can see they

297
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,880
posted a series uh the same link from

298
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,680
live Journal

299
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,740
and then this is the article using the

300
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,100
same title written by intrusion truth

301
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,740
but if you look at the content it is

302
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,519
actually a piece of article accusing the

303
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,139
U.S surveillance program

304
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,380
so this is another example of how they

305
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,500
try to fabricate an attribution report

306
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,519
you can see the writing cells they try

307
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,180
to mimic those report published by cyber

308
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,639
security company like mentioning Shadow

309
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,760
pad which is also a very famous Chinese

310
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,959
apt hacking tool and then I'm saying

311
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,380
that apt-41 is related to Mustang Panda

312
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
and then these apt group are funded by

313
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,380
the US government and also related to

314
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,040
the attack against Chinese Northwestern

315
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,680
Polytechnic University and on the right

316
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,199
hand side you can also see the title of

317
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
the article is

318
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
the can be translated to the people

319
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,480
behind apt-41 and they will say things

320
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,380
like abd41 AKA a promethium strong pity

321
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,720
aptc 41 yeah you'll get the idea

322
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,959
so just now um is the first Nuance

323
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,100
changes

324
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,699
um in hijacking the narratives so in the

325
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,400
next part we also see that this kind of

326
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,859
echoing technique actually goes to

327
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,880
another level when they have tried to

328
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,760
post this content in a cycle so first

329
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,339
they will post the malicious content on

330
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,099
local forums and then share them onto

331
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,380
social media platform and then the

332
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,959
screenshot of those content will then be

333
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,439
shared back to local forums so on the

334
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,679
first side you can

335
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,840
for regular audience they might get the

336
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,059
wrong idea that this kind of narrative

337
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,660
is popular online which in fact it is

338
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,980
actually not yeah so um these we found

339
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,840
that this kind of content was shared

340
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,059
among communities of different purposes

341
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,700
including lifestyle politics local

342
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,360
community things like that so um for

343
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,900
this part um Troy will elaborate this

344
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,840
kind of changes in TTP in the attack

345
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,840
cases targeting Taiwanese politician

346
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,340
hello and this is chair from tindiva so

347
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,240
for now on we're going to give a case

348
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,260
study oh okay okay we are going to give

349
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,860
a case study to uh illustrate what

350
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,380
Sylvia song just mentioned the from

351
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,500
parenting to echoing the idea how it

352
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,840
works and we thought this campaign

353
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,640
focusing especially focusing targeting

354
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,679
Taiwanese people without this name with

355
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,580
China root and

356
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,860
uh this campaign this operation has

357
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,020
launched a lot of campaigns who is

358
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,720
starting around

359
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,720
mid-2021 and some of them some key

360
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,580
campaigns has been exposed by the uh

361
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,539
taiwan's law enforcement mjib uh the

362
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,220
reason we named it

363
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,880
the China rule because the key

364
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,500
amplifier's name is called

365
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,460
which China root is a Chinese medicine

366
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,640
and according to Google I believe the

367
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,400
name of the China route is called in

368
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
Japan it's called

369
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,059
Korea Cocos so basically the little kind

370
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,299
of lots of fake fan page and fake

371
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,480
accounts used in this kind of operation

372
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,660
and we for the past 18 months we have

373
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,539
identified over 200 fan page and

374
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,520
thousands of bar accounts are crossing

375
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,980
Twitter Facebook and lots of local

376
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,679
forums and you can see here it's

377
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,960
especially targeting Taiwanese people

378
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,960
because they use lots of taiwan's

379
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,980
traditional Chinese characters and some

380
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,299
of the materials which are videos and

381
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,600
usually narrative with the taiwan's

382
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,039
Hawken accident accent sorry so I think

383
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,120
that we can see that focus on their

384
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,000
target focus is almost about the

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,299
taiwan's pro-independent politicians and

386
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,299
they will show in something we can show

387
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,200
the detail later

388
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,900
is that we can see its key narrative is

389
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,559
about three aspects the first one is

390
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,160
showing how POA is strong and taiwan's

391
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,980
military defense is weak for example

392
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,500
this kind of definitism is saying that

393
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,440
POA is ready

394
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,419
and ready to conquer Taiwan immediately

395
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,940
and the present time one has already

396
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,120
escaped and they were attacked they will

397
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,039
seize every kind of opportunity to

398
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,280
attack the pro-democracy U.S politicians

399
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,760
and they will find every ways to

400
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,280
discredit the taiwan's governmental

401
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
policies regarding covet regarding the

402
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,220
scene and sometimes even they will

403
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,120
theoretical spread this information to

404
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,400
accuse that the Taiwanese government is

405
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,780
causing its people's uh more death

406
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,360
you can see the slide on the right hand

407
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,679
like even some uh politicians or

408
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,559
personal affairs will be accused

409
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,419
okay

410
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,240
so from parenting to echoing the key

411
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,640
idea is that the self Zone just

412
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
mentioned it creates some kind of Cycles

413
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,559
it's a new kind of mechanism which we

414
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,500
have never seen before we believe it's a

415
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,080
good way to stay away from the social

416
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,080
media detection and also at the same

417
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,740
time this kind of mechanism can create a

418
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,460
some kind of authenticity

419
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,220
here's the basic sample you can see on

420
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,799
the left hand there's a Twitter pose of

421
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,720
fake news saying that the one station in

422
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,440
Taiwan has explosive massive Covey

423
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,320
infections which cause at least 4 000

424
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,140
people get infected and then

425
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,720
the actor Will screenshot this Twitter

426
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,960
post and post it on Facebook

427
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,020
and with this kind of don't uh we can

428
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,919
see if you screenshot this post the

429
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,200
this Twitter account you don't have to

430
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
worry that the Twitter will censor this

431
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,360
and kill this Barnet because the

432
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,179
Facebook has already

433
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,280
screenshotted and becomes some evidence

434
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,559
to show him that there's a key evidence

435
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,220
of this this information

436
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,240
and we can see a more complicated

437
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,940
mechanism in here the first one is that

438
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,860
there's a multi-layer

439
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,340
uh which I was saying that the mechanism

440
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,360
is very expandable so in this case uh

441
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,140
you can see the first one is called uh

442
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,400
no CD Playboy beige and lungs the first

443
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,919
one is also the same narrative showing

444
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,340
that the Taiwan has over has a massive

445
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,140
infection for over 4 000 people uh that

446
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,780
was a fake news back then so in this

447
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,260
case it showed a first post on Twitter

448
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,020
and secondly he

449
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,900
screenshot is Twitter post and post it

450
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,679
on Facebook and then he backed because

451
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,320
the Twitter account was deleted so he

452
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,480
want to listen he want to spread this

453
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,900
information back to the Twitter so he

454
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,039
used the Twitter to spread it again and

455
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,200
then because the Facebook account was

456
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,220
also deleted so he reported it back to

457
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,280
the Facebook again and this time you can

458
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,039
see uh sorry the slide didn't you can

459
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,520
see there's he mobilized deployed at

460
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,080
least 100 Facebook exponents to spread

461
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,100
into the major taiwan's Facebook groups

462
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,580
so with like this kind of schema it can

463
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,260
uh efficiently and effectively to stay

464
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,299
out of the detection and quickly

465
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,940
responds to social media platforms

466
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,880
detection and most importantly with like

467
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,100
kind of help of this kind of panel which

468
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
we just say in the earlier the kind of

469
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,380
reuse infra you can

470
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,380
massively

471
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,440
spread into the taiwan's major Facebook

472
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,380
groups to create lots of authentic

473
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,539
engagement

474
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,400
okay

475
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,120
and most importantly they not just back

476
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
and forth from Twitter and Facebook it

477
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,299
will explore a lot of local forums uh

478
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,360
for example you can see the uh

479
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,940
screenshot here because

480
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,220
we we understand that just like the

481
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,400
fishing case in the previous speech lots

482
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,340
of this kind of local and foreign has

483
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,340
weak security standards so in this case

484
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,240
it's a foreign in Taiwan famous for

485
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,820
talking about baby caring it's a forum

486
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,340
for the young parents to talking about

487
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,400
how they taking care of the new babies

488
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240
and we found that the actor patch

489
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,419
created a lot of suspicious accounts and

490
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,659
posed a lot of fake news about taiwan's

491
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,120
vaccine policy is calling causing people

492
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,880
a little baby

493
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,240
More Death so they can screenshot this

494
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
kind of uh fake posts on the local

495
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,380
forums and posted on Twitter and then

496
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,820
recycle used to use this and creating a

497
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,918
so-called of disinformation cycle

498
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,779
Okay so

499
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,140
and also we found the actor of the

500
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,260
operation China route will seize every

501
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,279
opportunity of the political event for

502
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,440
example you can see the rising tension

503
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,580
rise the rising tension happened during

504
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,760
the U.S House speaker Nancy Pelosi visit

505
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,900
Taiwan

506
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,159
it directly spread the

507
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,440
please notice the time slam is happened

508
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,340
right before the Nancy porosis video he

509
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,400
said that taiwan's airport is crowded

510
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,159
and all the rich people are running away

511
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,179
so it's directly spreading some trying

512
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,940
to saw in the chaos into the Taiwan

513
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,100
Society

514
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,840
and after densy pelosis did uh left left

515
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,220
Taiwan so he spread lots of

516
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,340
narrative and materials trying to

517
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,320
desecrate the

518
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,020
Taiwan government and the Nancy Pelosi

519
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,600
and spread lots of this information such

520
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,980
as the Nancy with his son and Taiwanese

521
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,140
government pay a lot to make Nancy

522
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,380
Pelosi to visit and he also deployed

523
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,159
lots of Facebook bonnets to spread into

524
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,220
the taiwan's major

525
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Facebook groups you can see the red box

526
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,440
in the slides

527
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,580
so uh in summary we believe the China

528
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,559
route has uh although we did not see

529
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:55,380
much engagement like the Chinese State

530
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,020
media but we can see it has been

531
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,779
persistently uh

532
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,299
launched lots of a campaign during the

533
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,080
18 months and he has been active till

534
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,860
the day I made this speech so we think

535
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,500
that there must be a sustainable

536
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,940
resource behind the actor and they can

537
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,299
keep constantly creating lots of funness

538
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,799
and most importantly he is very focused

539
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,900
to develop some Advanced and

540
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,480
some new techniques to stay out of

541
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,860
detection of the social media platforms

542
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,279
okay so I'm going to give a Outlook and

543
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,860
conclusion uh

544
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,980
this conclusion is based on our past

545
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,740
three years experience we have

546
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,500
collaborated with I think almost all

547
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,100
kinds of stakeholders in Taiwan uh

548
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,520
dealing with this kind of

549
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,340
Expo weaponization of the social media

550
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,640
by these kind of authoritarian or you

551
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,679
can say the adversary regimes

552
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:12,240
the key question we often got asked is

553
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,020
that does China understand the power of

554
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,340
social media

555
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,940
I think is a simple answer is yes

556
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,840
because China has deported the I think I

557
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,340
would say the

558
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,740
most powerful and most advanced

559
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,440
censorship system inside is great

560
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,620
firewall the way board WeChat has the

561
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,380
most advanced censorship system so the

562
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,419
Chinese government can spread whatever

563
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,659
the message that he wants but in recent

564
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,659
years what worries us is that the

565
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,080
Chinese government is fully aware of the

566
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,539
power of the western social media

567
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,059
platforms the platform we are using

568
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,679
right now so we think to step back from

569
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,200
the just the button net or what we say

570
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,539
the same kind of operation China route

571
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,539
in the most strategic way to think about

572
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,779
this issue is that China has deployed

573
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,840
more and more resource into building its

574
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,840
over operations we can see for since

575
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,659
2019 the Hong Kong protest and taiwan's

576
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,820
major election leaving a Kobe outbreak

577
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,779
and especially in the Ukraine world this

578
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,840
year earlier uh we have seen more and

579
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,240
more collaboration between these kind of

580
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,419
authorian regimes such as China and

581
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,779
Russia their state media are starting to

582
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,659
somehow collaborate with each other for

583
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,520
example we can see China's propaganda

584
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,860
machine as amplifying China's

585
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,380
disinformation up sorry Russians

586
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,080
disinformation they will translate this

587
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
Russian into this information into

588
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,299
Chinese and spread it into the

589
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,679
chinese-speaking ecosystem

590
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,880
and only other side is that we have seen

591
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,059
just we have mentioned earlier the this

592
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,779
kind of Bonnet what we call the

593
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,320
suspicious uh China Nexus operation this

594
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,559
kind of covert operation has been I

595
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,200
think it will be a shares asset among

596
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,080
these kind of state actors because we

597
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,640
have seen their

598
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,399
not just the China rule targeting Taiwan

599
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,179
we both seeing lots of campaign happens

600
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,539
simultaneously and they will especially

601
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,700
targeting all kinds of issue almost at

602
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,799
the same time for example if you check

603
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,960
on a Twitter or you can check on our

604
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,260
database you can see the panels related

605
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,419
to China with also targeting golden

606
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:48,240
great till now and Target saying that

607
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,820
xinjiang is no human right violation

608
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,940
right now and also lots of coffee

609
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,340
ordering conspiracy theories and Target

610
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,440
in Taiwan and spreading lots of

611
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,799
information about Ukraine so

612
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,980
in this case although we haven't find

613
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,340
any Smoking Gun

614
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,679
to directly link this kind of covert

615
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,559
assets cover operations back to the

616
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,080
Chinese government but thanks to the

617
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,120
treaters uh 1980 data set we can have

618
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,620
more confidence to group this kind of

619
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,380
suspicious activity and back to the

620
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,640
mainland China so we believe that with

621
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,539
this kind of close examination what

622
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,240
important is that we found this kind of

623
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,500
fun that has somehow a lot of resources

624
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,039
and somehow the actor are

625
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,159
a real political junkie I would say and

626
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,039
they they watch the political news even

627
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,740
much more than a political science

628
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,640
graduate students like me they post they

629
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,760
can digest the hotline the trending

630
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,700
higher headline today and made it into a

631
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,940
disinformation material right right

632
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,000
after so

633
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
for the future outlook we believe it's a

634
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,700
little green because we believe if we

635
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,940
don't study to research this kind of

636
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,600
threat we will be the actor the

637
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,320
adversary side will study more than

638
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,260
Earth and because we also believe the

639
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,080
social media platform is the essential

640
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,919
part of our daily lives and for some

641
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,279
countries the social media platforms is

642
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,779
the internet itself so uh as and based

643
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,600
on our experience in Taiwan and we see

644
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,080
that the Chinese government will seize

645
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,179
every opportunity these kind of

646
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,860
operations will

647
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,380
take advantage of all kinds of political

648
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,539
events and the direct consequence of

649
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,059
this kind of operation is that the

650
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,359
mobilization of online extremities and

651
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,940
once this kind of extremism is being

652
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,399
mobilized we can see the real harm

653
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,599
against some uh specific groups such as

654
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,820
we can see the taxing campaigns against

655
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,520
Western journalists and we can see them

656
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,000
trying to incite some protests in the

657
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,540
United States most importantly this kind

658
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,599
of operation can strategically distract

659
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,239
everyone's attention from what China is

660
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,659
doing right now so although although I

661
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,940
have to say the the protests in U.S

662
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,300
didn't work yeah

663
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,899
and we have to I don't we almost got a

664
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,000
runoff time so I'll give very quickly

665
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,020
that uh just the same idea is that

666
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,080
we believe the the political event is

667
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,619
the key uh we need to especially in the

668
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,859
election season for example we have seen

669
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,680
some suspicious re partner related to

670
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,920
the China route also targeting the 2020

671
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,859
U.S Milton election right now they are

672
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,160
spreading some propaganda and conspiracy

673
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,260
conspiracy theories

674
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,160
and speaking of the the holiday

675
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,400
digesting the the trendy headline is

676
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,260
that we can provide some interesting

677
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,760
case is

678
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,820
the last week the Chinese China's

679
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,720
Chinese party Congress and they

680
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,300
there's a dramatic thing is that the

681
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,440
hujing Tao the former prime minister was

682
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,359
escorting out of the party venue so they

683
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,660
immediately react to this kind of event

684
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,339
and spread a lot of this information

685
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,099
saying that they are little they

686
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,740
disguise as a well-known news agency

687
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,040
looters and spread like uh hujintao was

688
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,800
actually in bad Health he was have to

689
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,140
live it's not like what the other

690
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,260
Western media says the what kind of say

691
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,680
about bad thing about Xi Jinping so

692
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,339
that's kind of a story it does kind of

693
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,400
quick response to whatever political uh

694
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,660
event

695
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,000
so that's the final part is the

696
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,700
medication uh because I'm running out of

697
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,980
time so the basic idea is that we

698
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,020
believe this kind of issue needs

699
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,060
multiple stakeholders we both need

700
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,820
public sector private sector we even

701
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,599
need civil society and

702
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,440
that's the uh steps we prepare for the

703
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,260
law and policy check we believe that if

704
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,660
we we want to mitigate this kind of

705
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,480
threat we the first step is to

706
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,619
study and prepare the

707
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,000
prepare the law and policy it's

708
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,940
important to review all the

709
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,160
international and domestic law about the

710
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,940
current uh

711
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,560
regulation regarding to the social media

712
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,020
platform and to understand this threat

713
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,839
you must start from the human security

714
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,760
and you have to build an accurate

715
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,000
understanding of the technology and most

716
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,960
importantly you have to build a cloudy

717
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,320
collaborative mechanisms you have to you

718
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,560
know work with other vectors sectors for

719
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,780
example you have to work with the cyber

720
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,740
security Community such us because we

721
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,780
