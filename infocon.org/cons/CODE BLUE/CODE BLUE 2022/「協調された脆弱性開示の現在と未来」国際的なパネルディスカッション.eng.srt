1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
I'm Ikuo Takahashi, the attorney you just introduced

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,380
.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,680
Today, I would like to talk about the present and future of coordinated vulnerability conferences.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,880
I

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,360
will be speaking from Japan, Tatsuyuki Itabashi of the Information-technology Promotion Agency.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760


7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,640
Mr. Lorenzo Piro from the EU,

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,020
and Mr. Alan Friedman from the United States

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,080


10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,840
.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,580


12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,239
I

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,460
will introduce it

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,399
later, but in the case of Japan, it

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,160


16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,180


17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,460
is defined within the

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,079


19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,700


20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,360
framework of the early warning partnership.  It is

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,440


22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,120
being defined in the form of a security problem area that can be a cause of damage to security,

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,879
and it is

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,960
also proposed in

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,860


26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,260
Iso.

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,060
What is the meaning of this? When

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,520


29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
thinking about computer security, it is very

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
important, well,

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,500
if there is a cyber threat, in a sense,

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,280


33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,100
sharing it is a reality.  Well,

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,040
I think it's something like fuel,

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
so to whom is

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,740
this going

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,720
to be an economic

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,299
opportunity?  Now, the topic of criminals has just

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,860
come out, and

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,280
now it is very important to pay attention to cyber threats of nations,

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,900
so it is also

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,240
possible that the

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,119
government is directly involved.

44
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,640
So, in

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,759
regards to this, when this vulnerability is discovered

46
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,979
, the question is what to do about

47
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,799
it. This has been going on for a long time.

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,040


49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,299


50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,079


51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,420


52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,020


53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,479


54
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,860


55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,800
There is an idea that the information must be completely shared in order to protect it, because the person already knows it, but in

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,739
contrast to this, there is such a thing as

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,140
complete disclosure.  Well,

58
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,840
are you saying that you're going to abuse that tool

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,300


60
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,920
?  Since it

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,940
will be misused

62
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,940
,

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,800
we should rather think about sharing information

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,280


65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,420


66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,379
in a responsible manner.  That's why,

67
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,000


68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,940
regarding this discussion, given the

69
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,180
current situation, we should think about it in the direction of a coordinated vulnerability conference,

70
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,840
which is the theme of today's session

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,319


72
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,140
.

73
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,800


74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,879
The story

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,340
is becoming a reality, and various

76
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,580
frameworks are actually being implemented in Japan,

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,099
Europe, and the United States.

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,099


79
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,540


80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,000


81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280


82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,959


83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,879


84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,400


85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,340


86
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,560


87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
However, I think there are some complex issues that arise in the conflict between full disclosure and responsible disclosure that I explained at the very beginning, and these three

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,879
areas.  I would like to invite people who are involved in this practical work from the

89
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,959


90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,159


91
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,080


92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,540


93
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,879
international community to deepen discussions on the current situation and how to deal with the issues.  I have prepared a panel,

94
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,360


95
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,560
what is my

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,379


97
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,798


98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060


99
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,500


100
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,080


101
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,919
motive?  First of all

102
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,180


103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,440
, I would like to

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,900
thank you very much

105
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,960


106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,820
for inviting me to receive this panel machine

107
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,320


108
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,759


109
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,800


110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,780
.

111
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,739
Since 2018, we

112
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,259
've set up a task force to set up a multi-

113
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,979
stakeholder group of

114
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:11,940
companies,

115
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,380
companies, and

116
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,540
groups, and a group of civil society

117
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,000
groups,

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,180
where

119
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,039


120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,820
we're discussing policies or vulnerabilities in Europe.

121
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,940


122
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,000


123
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,620


124
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,940
Disclosure,

125
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,560
there were two countries that had vulnerability recovery policies,

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,639


127
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
initially,

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
and

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,580
NISA, they did a lot of research, and they also did

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,560
goodbye

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
sewing at the

132
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,380
EU level.

133
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,539
So today

134
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,740


135
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,039


136
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,340
, I would like to introduce some of the research we have been

137
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,639


138
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,360
doing at NISA on this subject

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,460


140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,520
.  These are three topics.

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,240
First,

142
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,660
the current state of vulnerability removal,

143
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,500
the main findings, the main facts, and

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,780
an overview of

145
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,479


146
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,580
the issues and problems.  Initially,

147
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,220
only two countries

148
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,220
, as of 2018, only France and the

149
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,620
Netherlands had this

150
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,000
cvd in place.In the

151
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,639
Netherlands,

152
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,060
researchers

153
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,060
had set

154
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
conditions for this vulnerability recovery

155
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,400
.

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,239


157
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,940
It was a condition,

158
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,979
but in France the researchers were

159
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,620
protected, but they were to use it when

160
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,820
they had access to

161
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,780
[music]

162
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,160
this

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
long-

164
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,460


165
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,560


166
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,919


167
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,020
term institution.  We found

168
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,259
4 countries

169
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,479
already have this cvd policy

170
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,380
in place France Netherlands

171
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,080
Belgium and

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,759
Lithuania

173
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,720
10 countries were in

174
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,039


175
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,740
the process of implementing a national cvd policy and 9 countries have a cvd

176
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,699
policy in place

177
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,139
This Member State

178
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,240
, if you know, I don't have the time to cover it all right now,

179
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,620
but

180
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,960
what I can say for sure is

181
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,940
that some Member States are very advanced and some are lagging behind

182
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,819
.

183
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,960


184
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,440


185
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,240
We are moving in the direction of trying to develop

186
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,960


187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
this kind of

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,779


189
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,380


190
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,319


191
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,860
cvd policy across the entire European frontal area.

192
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,260


193
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,580
I was asked what is more important in the life cycle of the vulnerability. As a

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,839
cvd process that I

195
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,380


196
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,060
think is important, the handling and management of it came out to be important.

197
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,560


198
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,480


199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,339


200
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,800
Disclosure of kanji characters was

201
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,700
considered to be of low importance.

202
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,680


203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,060
In

204
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,220


205
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,019


206
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,019
addition

207
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,279


208
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,200
, I asked where the current good practice cvd pill policy

209
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,779
is, and what I found out was the

210
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,560
cvd policy

211
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,019
Here, the computer system

212
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,060
access authority,

213
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,800
that is, this proportion  What is the nature

214
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600


215
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,800
of this

216
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,300
researcher's

217
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,320
access to the computer system

218
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,459
? What information is

219
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,399
required in this vulnerability

220
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,459


221
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,540


222
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,820


223
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,399


224
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,260
report?  Also

225
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,100


226
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,519
, there

227
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,260


228
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,060
was a very interesting element in [music] good practice, whether there are appropriate communication channels in place between stakeholders

229
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,640


230
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,899
, and the possibility of

231
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,350


232
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,100


233
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,380


234
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,100


235
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,720


236
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,980
bounties for security researchers, and public disclosure of this.  So here's what I've learned from interviews with countries

237
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,839


238
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
: there are two stands,

239
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,399
ISO and IEC,

240
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,339
exterior ICC

241
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:52,160
2914741 and then

242
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,399
301142. And there's

243
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,620
also a bottom-

244
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,360


245
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,040
up approach, which we see

246
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,440


247
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,220
in the Netherlands.

248
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,000


249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,380
It

250
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,660
's bottom-up without any guidelines or how to disclose how

251
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,440
to

252
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,820
do it

253
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,399


254
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,399


255
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,040
. It's in the form of an ecosystem that makes this possible to unlock this vulnerability.

256
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800


257
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,920


258
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,680
Blocking information, adopting a

259
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,740
Common Security Advisor

260
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,700
Framework,

261
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800


262
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,939
service.

263
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,579


264
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,399


265
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,040


266
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,200


267
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200


268
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,740
As you can see from this table

269
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,519


270
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,800
, the majority of respondents said this should be the third

271
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,320
. Sitesert

272
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
should play a major role in this process,

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and the National Security Agency

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,120
continues

275
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,300
here.  There weren't a lot of answers about the direct status of this small intestine

276
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,839
or the direct involvement of overseas organizations

277
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,640


278
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,160


279
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,500
.

280
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,899


281
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,540


282
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,339


283
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,959
So what

284
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,240
's important here is this

285
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,860


286
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,720
awareness campaign, for

287
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,180
example,

288
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,800
Cybersec Breakfast in Lithuania, and in the Netherlands,

289
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,859


290
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,820
especially for young people, it's

291
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,100


292
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,940
called

293
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,320


294
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,940
Hacklight.  We are trying

295
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,899
to raise awareness about the role and this vulnerability of the Maritime Self-

296
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,120
Defense Force, and we

297
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,300
also have operational and crisis management activities.

298
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,959


299
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,480


300
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,779


301
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,339


302
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,440
I asked the interviewees what are

303
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,800
the obstacles and barriers to this cvcvd policy at the moment.

304
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,420


305
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,560


306
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,040
This legal hurdle or lack of strength

307
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,139
and government

308
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,519
ambiguity facing

309
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,380
Government ambiguity policy on this vulnerability

310
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,019
Limitation of incentive resources Lack of skills

311
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,339
and high implementation costs

312
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,480


313
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,320
This

314
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,820
is the lack of collaboration between stakeholders. These

315
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,860
are very important

316
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,220
processes

317
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,579
from discovery to disclosure

318
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,519
. And

319
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,839
how are we going to manage this process?

320
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,480
But there is

321
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,800
tolerance, and there are also legal challenges

322
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,990


323
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,519
[music]

324
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,180


325
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,359
What are the main legal obstacles to this business law or

326
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,699
copyright or business contract law, etc.

327
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,639
The most important thing here

328
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,600
is this criminal law

329
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,320


330
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,000
of disclosure of that vulnerability.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,839
We

332
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,600
need criminal law for a smooth process,

333
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,779
data data protection law,

334
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,220
and we see that those are the two big challenges.

335
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,519


336
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,820


337
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,620


338
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,019
lack of stakeholder cooperation and

339
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,260
limited market incentives; and that

340
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,360
many security labs are

341
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,339


342
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,500
activists rather than experts employed by Activis and private companies;

343
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,480
and

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,279
cbdvc's pot resources and skills

345
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,260
and

346
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,180
that the costs involved in the practical implementation of

347
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,680
cbd policy are so subjectively impactful

348
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,720
and that a top-down,

349
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,839
bottom-up approach is needed

350
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,300


351
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,959


352
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,540


353
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,760


354
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,300


355
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,959
Let's start with the government, so what is the role of the government? First of all, the government

356
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,619


357
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,699
can update the incomplete

358
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,339
cybercrime and intellectual property framework.  In terms of probability,

359
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,079
the role of the private sector,

360
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,060
should it be the leader or the follower? And as

361
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,300


362
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,079
we'll wrap up later, when

363
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,000
we look at what's happening in Europe, what we can

364
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,680
say is

365
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,079
already in the

366
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,199
first report back in 2018.

367
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,440
But there are two questions about how this vulnerability discovery

368
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,660
leads to crime.

369
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,939


370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,939


371
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,140


372
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,900


373
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,620
First, the conditions that must be met in order for a

374
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,079
crime related to the discovery of this vulnerability to be prosecuted

375
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,280
are the

376
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,619
Budapest Treaty Cybercrime

377
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,400


378
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,439
Convention, which

379
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,939
clearly says that

380
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,059
only unauthorized access

381
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,980
should be considered a crime.

382
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,960


383
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,600


384
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,919


385
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,419


386
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,220


387
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,160
So if this government has this policy in place and follows

388
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,539
the rules, it should

389
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,679
be able to find its vulnerabilities.

390
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,940
When you buy this ticket, you buy it with

391
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,260
the intention of getting on the bus

392
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,419
.

393
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,980


394
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,480


395
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,120


396
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,679


397
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,000


398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,700
Yes, with welfare state foresight, member states

399
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,580
can amend their criminal laws

400
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,659
to increase legal certainty for

401
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,059
security researchers, and this security researcher protection is

402
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,240
also achieved by granting whistleblower status

403
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,980
.  This is Directive 2019

404
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,000
1937 It is

405
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,660


406
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,480
also useful to define the role of an ethical hacker

407
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000


408
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,120


409
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,900


410
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,220


411
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,700
.

412
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,080


413
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,340


414
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,320
I would like to hear from Mr. Itabashi about the situation

415
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,620
.

416
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,539
Hello everyone. My name

417
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,360
is Itabashi from the Information-

418
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,760
technology

419
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,860
Promotion Agency, Japan.

420
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,559
I have been involved in the information security partnership for about 10 years

421
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,840
,

422
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,580
so I would like to

423
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,140


424
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,340


425
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,380


426
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,660
talk about that

427
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,840
.  I would like to

428
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,700


429
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,100
talk

430
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,080


431
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,559
about this information

432
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,460


433
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,380
security partnership

434
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,260
.  Third

435
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,640


436
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,120


437
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,340


438
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,959
, I would like to talk about the current issues and what we are currently considering to address those issues. First, I would like to

439
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,160


440
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,080
briefly touch on information security early warning partnerships

441
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,840
.  This

442
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,360
is based on the black people in the Ministry of Mobile Industry

443
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,580
, and the

444
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,039
purpose is to

445
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
ensure cyber security.

446
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,240


447
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,799


448
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,419
It

449
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,280
is designed

450
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,720


451
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,039


452
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,360


453
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,919


454
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,980
to prevent damage that is common to many things, unspecified or common, due to computer viruses, computers, foot access, etc.,

455
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,000
and to take

456
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,559
measures against these in construction work.

457
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,620
The purpose of this information security is to promote appropriate distribution,

458
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,880


459
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,539
improve the vitality of the economy and society, achieve sustainable

460
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,940
development,

461
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,520
and realize a society where citizens can live with peace of mind, safety, and peace of mind

462
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,679


463
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,600
.

464
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,320


465
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,940


466
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,539
This is a cautionary partnership, but this one was designed with the cooperation of the

467
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Post-IPA@JP Start CC and the

468
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
domestic mass security

469
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,820


470
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,360


471
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,220
experts.  Takahashi

472
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,200


473
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,260


474
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,000
: We have been

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,760


476
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,659


477
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,360
very indebted to lawyers from the beginning of the design to the present

478
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,400
.

479
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,460
The IPA

480
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,440


481
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,880
has created a committee that has been convened to

482
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,500


483
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,220


484
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,380
discuss current operational issues every year.

485
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,940


486
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,200


487
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,820
We are operating this system in such a way that we are allowed to

488
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,400


489
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400


490
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,620


491
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,080


492
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,439
discuss and

493
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,919
discuss improvement measures.  I would like to

494
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,200
briefly explain these guidelines

495
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000


496
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,980
based on the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's surplus, which I mentioned earlier

497
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,480


498
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,000


499
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,059
.  Well,

500
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,400
it's a guideline that stipulates the actions recommended by the people involved

501
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,659
.

502
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,039
Specifically,

503
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,179
IPA is the one.

504
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,179
After the acceptance period, JP Start CC defines it in

505
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,100
the form of an adjustment period.

506
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,860
We are cooperating with

507
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,500
the discoverers who discover discovery

508
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,760


509
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,460
persistence, website operators who take measures against website

510
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,220
vulnerabilities, and

511
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,679
software product developers who take measures against vulnerabilities in software products

512
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,280


513
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,159
.  I

514
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,220
have written a description of the process of taking countermeasures against the cat's vulnerabilities, and

515
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,840


516
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840


517
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,280
this design is a partnership.

518
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,860


519
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,620


520
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,299
Now, we have specified the scope

521
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,679


522
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,480


523
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,580
of the definition because the vulnerability causes damage to an unspecified large number of people.

524
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,260


525
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,419


526
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,620
Specifically, we

527
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,559
are targeting software products used in Japan

528
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,780
.

529
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,760
Regarding websites, we are

530
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,520


531
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,500
targeting websites that can

532
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,860
be accessed from within Japan, so this system is

533
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,419


534
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,740


535
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,500
divided into two types: software products, websites, and web applications.

536
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,179


537
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,059


538
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,940


539
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,120


540
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,080
So, let's move on to the third explanation about the students

541
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,980


542
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,380
.

543
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,539
There are

544
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,120
three stakeholders in the form of the discoverer, the website operator,

545
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,340


546
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,380


547
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,480


548
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,740
and the

549
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,520
software

550
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,100
product developer.  For

551
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,500
those who discover  Well, there is one advantage that through IPA for a fixed period of time,

552
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,880


553
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,400


554
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
it is possible to encourage

555
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,659
people who need to fix vulnerabilities found in product development and websites

556
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,940
to take

557
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,460
action.  Also, in

558
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,000


559
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,340
the case of software products

560
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,320
, the name of the person who discovered

561
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,679
it is when the vulnerability countermeasures are announced.

562
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,780


563
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,860


564
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,260
It's a portal site called, and

565
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,840


566
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,120
when we disclose vulnerability and personal information to you

567
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,500
, we also

568
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,960
disclose the name of the

569
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,460


570
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,039
person who discovered it.  I think there are merits

571
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,780
like the three that are written here,

572
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,240
and the

573
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,159
website is the same.

574
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,260


575
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,960


576
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,919


577
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,200
Next,

578
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,419
I would like to explain how the partnership is

579
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,460
actually implemented, as

580
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,260


581
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,500
I explained earlier.

582
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,120


583
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,279


584
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,100


585
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,760


586
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,620
Well, the discoverer has arrived. Regarding the vulnerability that the discoverer found, we have sent it to ipay, which is the acceptance period

587
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,960


588
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,360
.

589
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,679


590
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,880
In

591
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,100
that case, the

592
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,080
person who discovered it will report it to Eye Paint,

593
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,520
and

594
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,480
IPA

595
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,100


596
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,039
will forward that report to JP

597
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,539
Start CC.  If you have

598
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:58,679


599
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,779
the contact information of the developer of the product

600
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:03,120
, you can search for it

601
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,020
again.

602
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,820
JP Start CC

603
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,460


604
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,679
will pass the information to the product developer.

605
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,760
When

606
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,700
the vulnerability of that product was fixed, as you can

607
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,520
see at the top,

608
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,840
it says JP Start IPA, but

609
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,960
this is the vulnerability

610
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,380
information portal

611
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,840
site, so we announced the vulnerability countermeasure information here.

612
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,220
As I

613
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,020
said earlier, when we announce it here, we publish

614
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,720
the name of the discoverer together

615
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,840
with it.

616
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,159


617
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,360


618
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,980
In the case of reporting vulnerabilities in web applications, in

619
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,200
the same way, the person who discovered

620
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,340


621
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,559
it will report it to ipay.In

622
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,059
this case, the

623
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,279
IP will directly

624
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,200
contact the website operator.

625
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,380
Yes, I will

626
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,059
contact the website operator directly and

627
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,580
ask

628
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,740


629
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,120


630
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,439
them to come up with

631
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,279
countermeasures.  Secondly

632
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,960
, I would like to briefly explain the operational status of the early planning partnership

633
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,100


634
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,740


635
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,520


636
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,539
.

637
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,039


638
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,559


639
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,900


640
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,940
So far,

641
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,200
it has been in operation for about 18 years

642
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,919
, and the graph shows the number of notifications submitted each year.

643
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,779


644
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,460


645
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,220


646
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,299


647
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,000
So, the pink one is the delivery date

648
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,059
of the website, and this

649
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,279
graph is up to the end of December 2021,

650
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,179


651
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,279
but it is the

652
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,299
total

653
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,820
sales of software products and websites.  The

654
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,940
total

655
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,140


656
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,840


657
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,320


658
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,419
number of notifications

659
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,400
received is 17,139.

660
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,200


661
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,320
This graph shows quarterly notifications over a

662
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,159
three-year

663
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:17,940
period,

664
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,760
and the

665
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,340
most recent

666
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,360
second quarter of 2022,

667
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,059
June, is the number of notifications from April to June

668
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,520
.

669
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,659


670
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,140


671
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,440


672
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,980
The table on the right shows the number of notifications in the second

673
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,299
quarter, which is shown in the

674
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,159


675
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,140
bar graph earlier

676
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,799


677
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,539
, with 75 cases involving software, and

678
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,520


679
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,240
88 cases involving websites.  We have

680
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,539
received 12,308 reports, and we have received a total of 17,465 reports

681
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:04,200


682
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,600
.

683
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,760


684
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,860


685
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,520
Vigilance Partnerships dealt with and

686
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,559
published

687
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,700
green

688
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,039
bar charts  Now, we have announced

689
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,320
24 cases of the second antibody in 2022,

690
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,939
so let's

691
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,440
continue with the

692
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,360
operational status

693
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,380
as of June 2022.

694
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,760


695
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,140
If

696
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,360
you look at this graph, you can see the operation status of

697
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,460


698
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,380
the software.

699
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,480


700
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,399


701
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,340


702
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,860
There are 2,417 cases that have been announced, and

703
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,880


704
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,220
although it is written in yellow, there

705
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,220
are 2,087 cases that are currently being handled,

706
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,100
so

707
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,659
about 40% of all notifications are still being handled.

708
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,940


709
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,419
This is the situation, and in the lower graph, this is the

710
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,340
website handling status.

711
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,299


712
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,860
Regarding the website, it says "

713
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,440
Fix."

714
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,779


715
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,559
The total

716
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,080
number of cases is 12,308 and 38, so

717
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,020
86% of the total has been corrected

718
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,918


719
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,919


720
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,480
.

721
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,580


722
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,020
So,

723
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,100
actually, the product types

724
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,260


725
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,860


726
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,500
of software product vulnerabilities that are reported to the creative vigilance

727
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,520


728
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,380


729
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,159


730
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,860
partnership are represented in the pie chart of the graph.

731
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,360


732
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,460


733
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,220
The situation is that reports of vulnerabilities in smartphone applications account for about half of the cases, and as

734
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,220


735
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,559
smartphones become more popular, the situation is such that the number

736
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,020
of vulnerabilities reported in smartphone applications is also

737
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,460
increasing

738
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,960
.  As

739
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,760
for the pie chart below,

740
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,740


741
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,779


742
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,419
it describes the impact of the

743
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,380
products being reported, but

744
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,039
regarding the impact,

745
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,720


746
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,340
such as the execution of arbitrary scripts or arbitrary commands

747
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,659


748
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:40,559
Vulnerabilities

749
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,480
that have an impact account for about half of the total, so

750
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,840


751
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,640
next is

752
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
the status of websites.

753
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,840


754
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,059


755
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:01,500
At the end of the day,

756
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,200
cross-side scrifting is

757
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,100
about 58%.  This accounts for 60% of the total

758
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,620


759
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,700


760
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,279
DNS information setting FV and SQL

761
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,020
injection.

762
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,840


763
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,200
In

764
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,419
terms of impact,

765
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,220
there are many cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

766
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,559
and

767
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,620
57% is displaying false information on the real site

768
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,879
.

769
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,899


770
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,100


771
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,380
That concludes our explanation. We are currently operating the Early Planning Partnership

772
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,760


773
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,840


774
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,179
, and I would like to briefly explain

775
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,860
what we consider to be the issues.

776
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,140


777
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,960


778
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,679
First of all, there are three issues related to software products. The first issue is that it

779
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,940


780
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,279
takes time for developers to respond to vulnerabilities

781
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,620


782
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,240
.

783
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,000
Well,

784
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,899


785
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,820
the range of types has expanded, including smartphones, and we

786
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,340
have received reports of systems costing 1,400 yen

787
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,559


788
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,620


789
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,740
.  On the development side,

790
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,720
there

791
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,880
is an increasing number of cases where it takes time

792
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,100
to investigate vulnerability information

793
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,899


794
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,760
and take

795
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,960
countermeasures.

796
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,220


797
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,539


798
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,000
There is also the problem of not being able to contact them, and it's the same here.

799
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,980


800
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,019


801
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,019


802
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,600
However,

803
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,580
there are cases where vulnerabilities are reported to software during development,

804
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,220
so it is

805
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,360
actually the

806
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,799
vulnerability information.

807
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,899


808
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,240


809
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,580


810
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,580
There are also cases

811
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,580


812
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,560
where communication

813
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,839


814
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,659


815
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,839
is cut off.

816
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,820
I believe that there is a negative part

817
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,599


818
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,000
in the disclosure of the

819
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,139
software product.  In addition,

820
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,659
there are many vulnerabilities, but it's equal, but there are

821
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,060


822
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,040
people, including consumers, who

823
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,139
think that the quality is not good, so it's decided that

824
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,859
product users

825
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,239
will publish vulnerability information.

826
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,399
On the other hand, it is

827
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,800
very negative to actively disclose it,

828
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,899
or

829
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,040


830
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,080
rather

831
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,800
, there is no demand for a climate that it is good to disclose vulnerability information even in Japan.

832
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,300


833
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,380


834
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,460


835
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,300
Next, there are two

836
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,480
operational issues related to website notifications

837
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520


838
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,380
. The

839
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,240
first is

840
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,220


841
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,099
that it takes time to contact the website operator.

842
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,900
This is

843
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,320


844
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,099


845
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,180
where you submit a website vulnerability report, and when you submit that vulnerability report,

846
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,040
you receive the URL, etc.,

847
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,079
and the

848
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,599
corresponding page of IPA.  On the other hand

849
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,980


850
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,260
, I've been browsing and investigating contact information, but it's quite possible that

851
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,579


852
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,500
the contact information for security-related issues

853
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,900
is

854
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,359


855
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,940
here.  Well, in such a situation,

856
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,980
IPA is somehow

857
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,200
looking for a contact, but it's difficult to find it, so I can't

858
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,660


859
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,460
find it.

860
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,839


861
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,280


862
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,980
One of the issues

863
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,000


864
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,980


865
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,060


866
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,460
is that it takes time to implement the vulnerability.

867
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,440


868
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,460


869
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,820
There are also organizations that support it, from large companies to

870
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,619
websites that are explained by

871
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,400


872
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,500


873
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,079


874
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:28,980


875
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,619
individuals.  Secondly, it's difficult for

876
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,619
the website operator

877
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,200
to take countermeasures against website vulnerabilities

878
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,420


879
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,400
.

880
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,140
So let

881
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,098
me briefly explain what IPA is currently thinking

882
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,380
about the issue you mentioned earlier.

883
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,640


884
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,440


885
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,859
First of all,

886
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,020
I have two thoughts about the problems

887
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,900


888
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,900
with software products.

889
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,060


890
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,940
I'm thinking about it,

891
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,780


892
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,000
but for example, for the reported

893
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,339
vulnerability, for the product developer who is proactively

894
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,260
addressing the vulnerability and

895
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,359
taking the initiative in announcing it.

896
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,880


897
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,859


898
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,660


899
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,220
We are currently considering the need for some form

900
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,480


901
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,619


902
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,900
of evaluation in this system.  It is necessary

903
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,820
for the developer to fully understand whether

904
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,980
there is really

905
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,680
a need to take countermeasures against these vulnerabilities

906
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,599


907
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,339


908
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,780
.  I think that

909
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,300
this is related to

910
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,320
various

911
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,520
organizations, etc. IPA,

912
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,500
using the contact channel for

913
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,760


914
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,859
product development bullets, it is necessary to raise awareness.

915
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,359


916
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,460
Thinking about this, we are

917
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,200
still continuing to implement it, and we

918
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,300
are thinking that we will continue to implement

919
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,780
it

920
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,880


921
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,180


922
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,060
.  First of all, as for the first

923
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,160
one, although it was

924
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,820
mentioned

925
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,380
as an issue

926
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,240
earlier, it takes time to find the contact information

927
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,880


928
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,020


929
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,660


930
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,180
for the website.  In

931
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,020
response, when a

932
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,240
security problem is found

933
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,420
, there are cases where external

934
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,280
parties contact

935
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,960
us, so please create a guide that tells them to clearly indicate their contact information for use on the website

936
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,280
.

937
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,500
So I

938
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,300
'm thinking of enlightening and enlightening

939
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,940
about that, and the second one

940
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,200
is about

941
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,960
the need for website operators to take countermeasures against vulnerabilities

942
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,700
.

943
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,160


944
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079


945
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,540
Well, it's about the need to take countermeasures against the vulnerabilities of websites that are vulnerable.

946
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,119


947
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,520
We are making materials, etc., so

948
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,240


949
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,020


950
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,880
we are

951
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,079


952
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,320


953
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,000
thinking of continuing to

954
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,440
carry out awareness-raising activities on that side.

955
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,099
Last but not least, I would like to

956
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,579
briefly explain the information security total

957
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,339
partnership system that is being implemented in Japan today

958
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,420


959
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,280


960
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,079


961
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,839


962
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,880
.

963
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,220
Thank you very much, Mr. Itabashi, for your understanding and cooperation

964
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,800


965
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720


966
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,819


967
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,660


968
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,480


969
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
.

970
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,500
I

971
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,099
would like to hear from

972
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,560


973
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,079
Mr. Alan Friedmans. Thank you Mr. Takahashi.

974
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,180


975
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,760


976
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,680


977
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,660


978
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,819
My name is Allahleet, and I'm

979
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,180
well known as someone who never

980
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,140


981
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,579


982
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:40,980
shuts up.

983
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,339


984
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,619


985
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,839
I was involved in an initiative,

986
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,180
an initiative on disclosure

987
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,720
, which we

988
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,820
've been fighting for since the 1990s, and we

989
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,740


990
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,300


991
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,099


992
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:06,119


993
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,560
decided to get the hackers and the companies together in the same room to talk about obstacles and introductions to collaboration

994
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,060
.  2021

995
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,400
is going to be different than it was in 2015. In 2015

996
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,420


997
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,940
there was quite a lot of pressure in the beginning, there was

998
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,300
conflict, but now

999
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,440
I want to argue that

1000
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,700
cbd is a dangerous subject

1001
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,859
all over the world, including Japan.

1002
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,339


1003
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,480
No longer

1004
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,099
we can talk about this freely

1005
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,160
and I think we've seen quite a bit of new color and it's

1006
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,280
easy but US policy is

1007
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,980
accepting cbd

1008
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,079
like many governments

1009
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,300
and right now  What I'm focusing on is

1010
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,540
trying to lower the barriers.

1011
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,720


1012
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,640
So

1013
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,320
the law hasn't changed, but

1014
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,470
the interpretation of that law has changed.

1015
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,160
[Music]

1016
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,320
And right now, the focus

1017
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,180


1018
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,900


1019
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,859


1020
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,180
is on how we can help the private sector to work with researchers.

1021
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,220
We have a number

1022
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,280
of laws, the first is

1023
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,560
related to kg, the second is civil law,

1024
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,619
and the good news is that

1025
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:23,640
we're getting a very favorable interpretation of this law

1026
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,680
.

1027
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,359
The Department of Justice, but this year

1028
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,940


1029
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,740


1030
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,000


1031
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,940


1032
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,200


1033
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,540


1034
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,040


1035
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,780
,

1036
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,220
we've been putting out guidance that if there's been a disclosure to all federal prosecutors,

1037
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,060
and

1038
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,240
if this is a disclosure by everyone, then this shouldn't be prosecuted, and so on.  In addition, the

1039
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,760
Digital Millennium Praise Copyright Act

1040
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,599
is expanding its coverage and exemptions

1041
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,359


1042
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:01,980


1043
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,200


1044
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,780
.

1045
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,319


1046
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,079


1047
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,099


1048
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,260


1049
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,640


1050
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,560
I would like to

1051
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,240
talk about how the establishment of an ecosystem has made vulnerability countermeasures easier, and how

1052
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
it has become easier to report vulnerabilities.

1053
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,240


1054
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,959


1055
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
Anyone know about cbd program?

1056
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,078


1057
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,000


1058
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,040


1059
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,640


1060
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,200


1061
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,079


1062
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,819


1063
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:45,780


1064
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,280


1065
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,000
This is the model. If the

1066
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,040
CBE

1067
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,599
trial period

1068
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,060
notices a vulnerability, it will

1069
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,880
coordinate

1070
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,599
and assign an ID.

1071
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,579


1072
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:08,300


1073
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,020
You can do it in a

1074
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,940
variety of categories,

1075
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,560
mostly

1076
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,900
vendors or open source

1077
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,280
projects,

1078
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,140
but back bounty

1079
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,760
programs, researchers, and

1080
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,200
hackers can also

1081
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,960
be CNN, so if your interest

1082
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,420
is over,

1083
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,200
let me talk to you.  I think

1084
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,940
We can start the process. This is a

1085
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,180
global effort. Right now

1086
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,520


1087
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,700
, I think there

1088
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,780
are probably 9

1089
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,220
CNAs in Japan.

1090
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,319


1091
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,579


1092
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:49,079
I

1093
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,579
would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for playing such a wonderful role

1094
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,819
in becoming a

1095
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,359
CNN.

1096
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,619


1097
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,000


1098
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,220


1099
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,260


1100
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,280
And then

1101
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,900
there's an

1102
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,819
on-body process to see if

1103
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,140
you

1104
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,660


1105
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,300


1106
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,460


1107
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,319


1108
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,540
've met the requirements

1109
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,420
, and there's training.  What I mean by objection is the

1110
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,079


1111
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,920
researchers, but the purpose is

1112
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,319
to make it easier for researchers to collaborate with the companies that make

1113
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,720
and maintain this software.

1114
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,880


1115
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,560
We

1116
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,920


1117
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,160
don't have much time left, so

1118
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,079
I would like to move on to the panel discussion

1119
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,640
. Thank you.

1120
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,200


1121
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:04,319


1122
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,720


1123
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,078
Pleats

1124
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,440
Yes

1125
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,700
Well, I

1126
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,740
don't have a lot of time left, but

1127
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,500
I'd like to have it in the form of a discussion.

1128
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,240


1129
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,359


1130
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,819


1131
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:35,040


1132
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,599


1133
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:37,560


1134
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,700
You mentioned that

1135
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,180
there are economic issues and political

1136
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,800


1137
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,160
issues, and in regards to legal issues, I was told that Japan is also

1138
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,160
doing its best

1139
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,839
.

1140
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,880
I'd like to explain,

1141
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,819
but the first intro

1142
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:04,319
is from October 2017,

1143
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,380


1144
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,880


1145
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,940
and it's a researcher investigating the P2P network of a security service provider

1146
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,240
.  After being arrested,

1147
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,140
hewas

1148
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,260
released without being

1149
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,540
charged.

1150
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,880
It's a very

1151
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,060
impactful thing, so is it

1152
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,060
correct to say that the level of law enforcement in Japan

1153
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,160
is also an important role

1154
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,880


1155
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,040
played by researchers in cybercrime or its trials?

1156
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,300


1157
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,400
As

1158
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,480
a

1159
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,700
lawyer, I am also thinking that I would like to

1160
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,680


1161
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,740
ensure that we can proceed in this way

1162
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,640


1163
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,980


1164
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,180
.

1165
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,900


1166
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,180
There is a commentary on

1167
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,260
the guidelines from a legal point of view

1168
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,480


1169
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,420
, and as for more

1170
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,960
detailed legal issues, it was in

1171
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,700
2004, at the start stage,

1172
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,180
that I wrote a commentary book.  was

1173
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,760
released at the same time, and it was revised three

1174
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,079
years ago.

1175
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,300


1176
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,440


1177
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,640


1178
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,920


1179
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,579
It took

1180
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,140


1181
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,440
about 10 years

1182
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,960
for the actual setting law to be amended,

1183
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,819
but the

1184
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,460
copyright law was amended to

1185
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,480


1186
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,900
reverse engineering for security purposes.  It's

1187
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,660
kind of a Japanese way of thinking about fair use,

1188
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,240


1189
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,280
and it's been confirmed that it's legal

1190
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,599
.

1191
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,040


1192
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,119


1193
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,880


1194
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,780


1195
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,339


1196
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,800


1197
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,260
For example, people from such departments have come to IPA, and

1198
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,700
since April this year

1199
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,839


1200
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,660
, the organization has been reorganized into the Cyber ​​Police Bureau.  I

1201
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,460
think that the level of cats will rise, so

1202
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,400
here I am.

1203
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,440


1204
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,380


1205
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,579
On the developer's

1206
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:35,040
side, are you

1207
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,280


1208
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,599


1209
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,520
saying that they have a dangerous attitude towards that report?

1210
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,819


1211
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,359


1212
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,160
We

1213
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,099
will secure the flow of opening the venue while making adjustments in that form

1214
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,160
.  I would

1215
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,160
like to ask Mr. Lorenz about

1216
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,740


1217
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,180


1218
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:03,780


1219
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,500
the efforts of the EU and the United States in each area, let's say, in order to ensure the gentlemanly attitude of the developer

1220
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,300


1221
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,160


1222
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,160
.  In that regard, if

1223
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,839
you have any incentives designed in this way

1224
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,579
or something

1225
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,420
like that, please

1226
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,420


1227
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,300


1228
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,220


1229
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,459


1230
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,880


1231
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,099
let me know.  But

1232
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:51,180
basically what he's saying is if

1233
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,640


1234
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,020


1235
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,500


1236
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,619


1237
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:06,960


1238
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,819
you can implement the cbd's policy

1239
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,960
that they're allowed to do this under the Budapest Treaty on the basis of proportionality, the

1240
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,460
government.

1241
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,460
It

1242
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,280
means that you can post cbd on your website, so you

1243
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,800


1244
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,119
can do it even if there is no specific incentive.Is

1245
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,020


1246
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,480


1247
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,980
there anything you think about that other than the United States?

1248
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,540
Important  I think we need to make a distinction between

1249
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,400


1250
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,079
not doing something because we don't

1251
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,280


1252
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,160
know it and someone who knows

1253
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,099


1254
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:56,160
better.

1255
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,359
From

1256
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,119
the role of the government to the role of the security world,

1257
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,760
it's still about

1258
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,520
helping, making sure that the first one

1259
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,740
goes well.

1260
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,540


1261
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,400


1262
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,180


1263
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,558
I think it's another issue for organizations, and I think it's a different issue than

1264
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,359
software suppliers'

1265
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,220


1266
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,619
unwillingness to take action.

1267
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:26,819


1268
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:29,420


1269
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,859


1270
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:33,900
We need to think about how people

1271
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,099
should intervene. And one more

1272
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,500
tool-related support. This is called multi-

1273
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,819
party disclosure

1274
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,920
.

1275
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,240


1276
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,900


1277
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,339


1278
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:52,260


1279
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,180


1280
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,700
If there is an impact on other vendors,

1281
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,020
we have strong coordination.  In the

1282
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,440
vendor community,

1283
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,640


1284
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,059
there is a new tool called Vince.

1285
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:08,180
This is automated

1286
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,040
coordination. This is a tool that the US

1287
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,880
government is

1288
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,920
using in the CNN process

1289
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,599


1290
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,579
.

1291
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:18,960


1292
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,599


1293
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,920
Let's call it the early days when the Vigilance Partnership was launched. Could you tell us a little bit about

1294
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,640
what kind of situation you had at that time and what led

1295
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,500
you to think about this

1296
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,940
?

1297
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,960


1298
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,140
In other words, the

1299
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,900
person who discovered the vulnerability directly contacted the

1300
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,740


1301
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,599
website or the software product developer directly, and the other party said that

1302
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,579
he or she was a

1303
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:50,640
hacker.

1304
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,940
However, there

1305
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,619
have been many situations where people

1306
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,660
have been reluctant to deal with that kind of person

1307
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,140
, so with the

1308
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,720
aim of avoiding that, government agencies and

1309
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,819
public agencies.

1310
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:09,059


1311
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,220


1312
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,040
I think that this kind of

1313
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,559
framework was designed with the idea that it

1314
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,260
would be possible to promote the circulation of

1315
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,020
vulnerability information and take countermeasures by intervening and acting as an intermediary.  Also, what is this system itself

1316
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,819


1317
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:28,339
, and is it now being very welcomed by

1318
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:31,500


1319
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,540
the community related to

1320
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,079
it?

1321
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:41,460


1322
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,180


1323
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,579


1324
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,680


1325
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,780


1326
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,700
Well, again, there is an increasing number of vendors who exchange vulnerability information directly with the person who discovered it, without returning the IPA directly to a public institution, and

1327
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,380
one of them is

1328
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,660
psat.  I think that the number of vendors that have built a system

1329
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,339
to accept such information

1330
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,200


1331
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,700
is increasing in Japan

1332
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,118


1333
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,599
.  Looking at the situation, it

1334
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,380
is not a big problem to deal with the vulnerabilities of various

1335
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,440
government websites or software used

1336
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,420


1337
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,440
by the government and to make

1338
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,880
government services extremely secure.

1339
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,240
I don't

1340
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,740
think so

1341
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,559
Ms. Anna

1342
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,240


1343
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,160
, could you please tell us about the US government's efforts to address these issues? We

1344
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,058


1345
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,040


1346
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,599
know very well that it is extremely difficult to create secure software

1347
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:43,260
.

1348
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,559


1349
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,700
There's nothing we can do better than the private sector

1350
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,319
.

1351
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,059
Government-made software is actually

1352
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,859


1353
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:56,400
terrible.

1354
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,300


1355
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,440


1356
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,540


1357
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,280


1358
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
There's a requirement that if someone

1359
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,400


1360
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,839
finds a vein,

1361
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,760
like a website about taxes, or

1362
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,859
a website about labor, if

1363
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,619
they find any vulnerabilities in something that the government is doing, they'll

1364
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,420
be notified so that they can be properly notified.

1365
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,520
And the U.S.

1366
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,800
government is doing this. It's not new. It's been doing this for the

1367
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,440
past four or five years

1368
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,619
.

1369
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,300


1370
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,859


1371
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:32,880


1372
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,740


1373
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,940


1374
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,059
It's a website,

1375
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:42,420


1376
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,720
so it's really embodying this policy. Can you tell us about how the US government is

1377
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,700
trying to do that,

1378
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,140
or how it's working on its security

1379
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,940
?

1380
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,819


1381
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:12,119
So, and

1382
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:13,440
we're also

1383
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,059
presenting guidelines to the member states, so that the

1384
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:16,859
European Commission has

1385
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,780
put in place a policy for cbd, namely a

1386
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,780


1387
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,960


1388
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,920
security review, and for each

1389
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,960
member state.  They

1390
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,040


1391
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,240


1392
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,180


1393
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,839


1394
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,099


1395
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:40,140
are saying that as a country we should introduce a policy on vulnerability, and in

1396
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,319
addition to recently

1397
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,059
growing and this

1398
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:53,119


1399
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,040


1400
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,500
is covering products here.

1401
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,900
It

1402
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,380
also includes the disclosure of vulnerabilities. When

1403
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,099


1404
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,140
asked about the situation of the Japanese government, I think that it is

1405
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,160
probably

1406
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,200
included in a very difficult situation,

1407
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,839


1408
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:15,900
so I decided to avoid that question

1409
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,579
and start from the Japanese framework.

1410
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,559
The Digital Agency was established

1411
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,319
last year.  However, does this mean that the

1412
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,180
head of the digital department must

1413
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,200


1414
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,940
also play a very active role in

1415
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,380


1416
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,760


1417
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,880


1418
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,200
addressing these issues?

1419
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,119


1420
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,220
Security measures are under the jurisdiction of the

1421
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,180


1422
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,980
government, and they are issuing instructions to each ministry and agency to take

1423
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,920


1424
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,040
proper measures.

1425
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,900


1426
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,940


1427
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,839
So, in

1428
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,079
the case of the Netherlands, if

1429
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:01,380
you dig up a government site,

1430
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,260
you can get a T-shirt like this, and you will tell

1431
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,000
me about it.

1432
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,980


1433
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,500
I don't know

1434
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,480
what kind of T-shirts will be distributed when the Japanese government is hacked,

1435
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,760
but in

1436
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,140
that way the Japanese government's

1437
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,480
security is enhanced.

1438
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,700
I also think that this is a very important matter, so

1439
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,760


1440
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,280


1441
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,619
I think we didn't have time to respond to the questions and answers from that floor today,

1442
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:34,619
but

1443
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,559
regarding this emphatic disclosure of vulnerabilities.

1444
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:39,839


1445
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,339
Thank you very

1446
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,100
much for your attention.

1447
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,279
