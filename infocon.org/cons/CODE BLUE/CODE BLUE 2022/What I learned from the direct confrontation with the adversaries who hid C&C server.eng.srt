1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:01,560
Hello everyone. My name

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,780
is Taniguchi from Fujitsu Systems Integration Laboratories

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,440
. First of all,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,519


5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,280
I would like to congratulate you on

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,759
the 10th anniversary of Code Blue

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,000
.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
From now on, I would like

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,380


10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,699


11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,779


12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,820
to give a lecture titled "What was obtained from a direct contact with an attacker who hid C&C

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,740


14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,979
server information in a

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,340
blockchain."

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,040


17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,239


18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,660
This is my first lecture,

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,340


20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,219
so I would like to introduce myself by positioning

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,980
my past four lectures and this one.

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,739


23
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,539
As

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,379


25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm sure you all know, DNS is a service

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,879
that associates domains with IP addresses.The

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,860


28
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
Internet was designed based on the theory of good nature.

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,159


30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799


31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,420


32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,340


33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,640


34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,700
Attackers don't want the location of the C&C server to

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,600


36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
be known, so they use techniques such as domain generation algorithms

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,780


38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,060
to register a large number of random domains in the ED rendition and try to pinpoint

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,560
the

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,380
location.  However

41
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,280
, since we have already accumulated research knowledge in these areas for 10 to 15 years,

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
we can make more use of

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
it.

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,020


45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,680


46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,860


47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,320


48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,579


49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,079
On the other hand, the

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,880
successor does not necessarily have to use DNS.In

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
the

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,119
Internet space,

53
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,619
if you know your IP address, you

54
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,460
can communicate.

55
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,320


56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,660
I just need to be able to

57
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,400


58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,920


59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,540


60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,340
tell the location

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,860
of the Asian Sea server and the commands to it.

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,459
Hiding was predicted in 2007

63
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,920
and its abuse was actually confirmed in 2009.

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,620


65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,819


66
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,160


67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
It

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,260
has already been confirmed that Tagram images are hidden using fixed-price graphics technology

69
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,660
, and a relatively new trend is to

70
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,459
exploit blockchain

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,040
technology.

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,560


73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,120
The blockchain has a function that allows

74
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920


75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
you to write a memo in a transaction, which is similar to writing a subject line in a passbook.

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,700


77
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,720


78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,319


79
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,580


80
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,080


81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,819


82
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,360
It has already been predicted, and around 2019 it was

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,959
actually exploited, so Professor Christian Door, who was involved in the international

84
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,860
discussion

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,620


86
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,599


87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519


88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,099
this time, wrote a paper in 2018 about a case where a

89
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,840
ransomware server took over a blockchain.  I would like to talk about cases where blockchain has been abused, and

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,220


91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,120
most of the content of this lecture was given at

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,860
Blackout Asia or

93
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,800
Asia CCS last year.

94
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,060


95
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,560


96
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,700


97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,720


98
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,659
Now,

99
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,739
for example, if you are connected to the Internet, if you search with

100
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:44,879


101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,519
the keyword "Futakuchi", which is common to ACM

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,260


103
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,440
, you will be able to reach the ACM page.

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,239


105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,620


106
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,760


107
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,260
You should be able to

108
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,519
find the paper.At the end of the paper, there is a list

109
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,200
of IP addresses of the Shinanshin servers that I have been steadily detecting,

110
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,080
so please select one IP address from the list

111
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,700


112
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,720


113
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,280
and

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,580
search it with File Stotal.  And

115
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,478
we can find specimens related to this attack. However, there are cases where the

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,820
specimen itself is

117
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,460
not found, but there are cases where the specimen itself is not found, but

118
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,758
please forgive me

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,360


120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,620
.

121
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,660


122
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,060
Professor Christian Dore, who I collaborated with on this project, was

123
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,199


124
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,360
no longer able to achieve

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,060
a powerful scene.

126
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,139


127
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,479
I

128
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,940


129
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,600


130
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,720
would like to take this opportunity to thank him for being

131
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,500


132
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
an associate professor at Delift University of Technology in the Netherlands.

133
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,520
I was

134
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,680


135
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,860
exploring the direction of international collaboration with Professor Christian Video

136
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,580


137
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,220
Martyr.At a workshop held in Tokyo in October, we basically agreed

138
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,300
to try to detect abuse of blockchain,

139
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,060


140
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,479
but shortly after that.  Since then, the corona turmoil began,

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,860
and

142
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,720


143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,100
it became impossible to hold face-to-face workshops with him

144
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,419


145
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,600


146
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759


147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,720


148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,699
.

149
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,479


150
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,680


151
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,220
As soon as I could see it,

152
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,840


153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,880


154
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320


155
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,479
I made a proposal for international collaboration to Professor Christian Douga, who

156
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,979
had been invited as a professor by a German research institute, Meteorite Meteorite, and he had been

157
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,020
thinking about it for a month and a half

158
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,220
to start international collaboration.

159
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,419
After the

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,759
start of the international collaboration

161
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,479
, the idea I proposed in about two months

162
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,900


163
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400


164
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,699
went by quickly.

165
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,960


166
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,259
However, the attacker's recurrence behavior was

167
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,300
early in about two weeks, and an

168
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,580
evasion mechanism was implemented, making

169
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,960
it impossible to take over.

170
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,080


171
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,940


172
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,220


173
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,039
We have confirmed the abandonment of the attack infrastructure in March 2020, and we have

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,240


175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,759


176
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,460


177
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,319
already given a performance at Black Cutter Asia about the attacker's evasive behavior after the takeover

178
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,039


179
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,220
of this

180
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,199
Asian CCS resistance bar.  Going back in time from the highlights of the collaboration,

181
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,080
what I gained when I worked hard on my

182
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,979


183
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,380
own, or what I gained through international collaboration,

184
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,780
is

185
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,280
not limited to this attacker.

186
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,319
The

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,520


188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,100


189
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,039


190
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,159
purpose

191
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,500
of the investment

192
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,600
is to convey to everyone the know-how when directly confronting an attacker who is attacking an

193
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,740
attacker.

194
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,060


195
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,560


196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,039


197
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,139


198
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,919
I will talk about

199
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,280
the whole picture of this attack and the defense

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,220
countermeasures This attack

201
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,800
was a phishing attack Target  became

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,880


203
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,460
It was mainly in Russia and Belarus. This is

204
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,800


205
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,539


206
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,819
a knowledge we gained because we redirected the traffic from the CRC server directly to the Syncol server

207
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,500


208
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,660


209
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,599
.

210
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,300
The malware used was Maria

211
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,660
Pony, and the peculiarity of this attack was that

212
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,880
the IP address of the CRC server

213
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,580
was hidden in

214
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,440


215
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,900
the blockchain.

216
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,300
Then, we created a mechanism

217
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,979
to detect the IP address of the Cyan C server,

218
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,039


219
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,080


220
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520


221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,740
and confirmed the specimens communicating with the detected C & C server IP address with Filestotal and accumulated hash values.

222
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,139


223
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,919
We made

224
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,199
a contract that we could use each other

225
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,699


226
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,219
's products for

227
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,339


228
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,140


229
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,700
skiing.

230
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,099
They said they used Sith if it was a hybrid

231
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,260
,

232
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,500
but I've heard that 300 samples were able to run properly in the sandbox, and

233
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,760


234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,580
as a result of this international collaboration

235
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,500
, communication from the

236
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,660
CRC server was directed directly to the single server.

237
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,260


238
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,720


239
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
So let's talk about the first takeaway, ethical considerations. First, let's talk about how

240
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,080
this attacker hid

241
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,820


242
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,959


243
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,000
the IP address of the CRC server in transactions

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,300
on the Bitcoin blockchain.  First,

245
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,500


246
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,519


247
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,339
let's say that the IP address of the Xianxi server is 142.93.0.206. First, divide this IP address into

248
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,080


249
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,420


250
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,800


251
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,019
two.  Hidden in the

252
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,040
transaction of the eyes

253
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,560
Here, the card action is

254
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
schematically represented in a diagram, but

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,000
time flows from the bottom to the top, and the top

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,440
card action

257
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,600
represents

258
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,820
the latest transaction.  2

259
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,640
octets 142.93 Swap the

260
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,580
order with

261
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,260
convert decimal to hexadecimal 93 change 5d142 to 8th place

262
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,740
combine this hexadecimal number to 5d8th place

263
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,920
So, if you convert this hexadecimal number to decimal number,

264
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,899


265
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,820
you get 23,950. If you do

266
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,980
the same process for the 3rd and 6th octets,

267
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,320


268
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,600


269
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800


270
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,019
you get 52,736.

271
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,060
Blockchain

272
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,860
abuseBlockchain API is used

273
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,000


274
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
to access the recalled amount of this transaction If you do the

275
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
reverse process, you can

276
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,540
get the IP address of the CRC

277
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740


278
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,600
server and communicate with the Xianqi server  The advantage of

279
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,339


280
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,200
attackers exploiting

281
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,180
blockchain is that, for

282
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,279
example, if an SNS is abused,

283
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,940
law enforcement agencies can ask the operator of the SNS

284
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,080


285
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,420
to delete the account

286
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,399
.

287
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,839
However, in the case of blockchain, in

288
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,839
principle, once a transaction has

289
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,579
been approved by a miner, it

290
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,920


291
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,440
cannot be altered or deleted, even by law enforcement agencies.

292
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360


293
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,820


294
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,959
I would like

295
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,700
to talk about the takeover idea that I came up

296
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,040
with. First of all,

297
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,140
if you know the Bitcoin address,

298
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,579
you can send the

299
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:19,140


300
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,640
Bitcoin.

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,920


302
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,800


303
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,839
There was an argument that if you send a random bitcoin, it might be possible to interfere with the

304
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,899


305
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,220
attacker's update of the CRC server

306
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,779


307
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,899
.  So my idea is

308
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,420
to set up a Syncall server first, convert the IP address of that Syncall server in the

309
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,220


310
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,279
same way as the attacker, and send the

311
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,620
converted bitcoin bitcoin to the

312
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,500
bitcoin address operated by the attacker.

313
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,180
I proposed this as an idea for an international company to move

314
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,500


315
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,779
the communication that the victim terminal was supposed to use to the C&C server to the

316
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,880
policy call server.

317
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,700


318
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,820


319
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,060


320
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,320


321
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,019
I succeeded in inducing it, but

322
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,940
there are some very interesting public offerings after this,

323
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,079
but since I'm

324
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,660
giving a lecture at Black Hat, I'll start

325
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,279
the story for Code Blue from here.

326
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,700


327
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,459
First of all, I would like to

328
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,519
talk about ethical considerations. This time, I hijacked

329
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,579
the communication that was supposed to be sent to the C&

330
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,779


331
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,360
server and directed it to the Syncall server.

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,560


333
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,940


334
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,100
In the worst case, even if

335
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,880
overcoming

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,980


337
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,720


338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,740


339
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,560


340
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,820


341
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,740
resistance is a good idea,

342
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,180


343
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,680
we have to stop implementing it.  In

344
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,699


345
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,860
response to this, I

346
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,500
completely asked HPI to perform this analysis, but when

347
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,779
I created a test relationship with Mr.

348
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,180
Maruyama on a box and tested it, the behavior of Maruyama

349
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,160
was the first.

350
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
It tries to download the necessary DLL for http get, but

351
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,019
our

352
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,760
progress server doesn't have that DLL, so

353
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,560


354
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,079
as a rare behavior, the

355
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,779
self-protection device activates and deletes itself without doing anything.

356
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:22,560


357
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,800
Okay, what this means is

358
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,480


359
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,519


360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,839


361
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,820
that by preventing the attacker from updating the C&C server,

362
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,380


363
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,579


364
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,740


365
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,779
it turned out to be a great way to even exterminate the surroundings from the infected terminal, so

366
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,740
take.  The

367
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,360
ethical considerations I would like to convey

368
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,440
here are that

369
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,620
everyone

370
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,420
follows the guidelines and

371
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,180
takes

372
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,760
ethical considerations into account when giving lectures or publishing papers.  If you know the address, you can

373
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,160
tell the provider, or if

374
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,779
there is a product with a vulnerability,

375
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,579
you can tell the

376
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,560


377
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560


378
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
vendor.  I wonder if there is an inoculated file in the place where a general victim terminal whose name is unknown and whose contact information is not known

379
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440


380
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,339


381
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,980
communicates with our synchro server

382
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,079


383
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,360
.

384
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,459


385
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,760


386
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
We spent most of our time on international collaboration, and

387
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,200
we realized that there was no problem, so we decided to

388
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,779
implement it.

389
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,639


390
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,740


391
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,680


392
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,399


393
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,620
don't overlook things

394
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,920
The first thing I learned was that there are things that are not possible, and we have to

395
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
think about them carefully

396
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,920
.

397
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,680


398
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,760


399
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,920
I

400
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360


401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
started from there because it would be easier to explain from the highlight part of the international education,

402
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,760
but the main thing for the Australian dollar this time

403
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,420


404
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,120
is

405
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,699


406
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:15,420


407
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,720
a big evolution of the attack method that I first detected when I was working hard by myself.  Based on that, I'm

408
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,300
going to talk about what I've learned

409
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,300
. Hypothesis testing in the

410
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,740
context of cybersecurity,

411
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,899
for example, thread hunting,

412
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,160


413
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,959
predicting and verifying vulnerabilities in organizational networks,

414
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,899
or  In the case of stupid hunting, I

415
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:37,920


416
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
think there is such a thing as predicting and verifying the vulnerabilities of tools,

417
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
but in

418
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,760
this context,

419
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,820
we directly interfered with the attackers

420
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,260
.

421
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,760


422
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,920
It's easy to predict that an attacker will take evasive behavior

423
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,500
. I predicted several

424
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,399


425
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,620


426
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,260
evasive patterns that an attacker would take, and what did I find

427
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,019
out as a result of verifying one of them?

428
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,180
That's what I want to tell you

429
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,500


430
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,820
here.I read the blogs of Checkpoint researchers in the early days of surveillance,

431
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,440
and

432
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,139
their blogs clearly described Maruya's behavior,

433
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,000
but there

434
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,320


435
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,600
is absolutely no bitcoin operation beyond the blockchain.  It wasn't written, so

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,000
I started by making my own tools and

437
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399


438
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,579
trying to

439
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,019
figure

440
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,940
out bitcoin operations

441
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,339
.  There

442
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,240
are three roles, which I call a sender, which is the

443
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,740


444
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,600
bitcoin address for sending bitcoins

445
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,040
, and the second one is

446
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,560
called an IP signal.

447
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,120


448
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,920


449
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,980
So

450
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,220
basically, in this attack, if you have these two

451
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,019
things, you can attack, but

452
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,120
IP signals basically continue to

453
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,339
receive bitcoins, so it's not a big amount,

454
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,300
but

455
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,760
bitcoins are accumulated.

456
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,179
Once you have accumulated a certain amount of bitcoins, you will become a

457
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,740
collector.  In the

458
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,660


459
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,319


460
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,540


461
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,459


462
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,660


463
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,299
early stages, the center was

464
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,160
a one-time bitcoin that was like disposable

465
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,260
bitcoins.  Since it was using an address,

466
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,000


467
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
it was probably sent using the function of some exchange.The

468
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,400
IP signal

469
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,660
basically used a

470
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,500
fixed

471
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,760
bitcoin address from beginning to end

472
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,080
, so the

473
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,539
attacker himself  I think it's a bitcoin address created by calculation, and

474
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,320


475
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,660


476
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,179
I know the specific value of the bitcoin address, so I'll show

477
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,120
it.

478
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,940


479
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,460


480
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,700
For example, if you copy and paste all these strings and

481
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,400
search, you will reach Blockchain.com's page at the top,

482
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,900


483
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700


484
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,580
where you can see all the transactions made by the attackers regarding this 1BK maintenance.

485
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,940
you can

486
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,760
after sending

487
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,220
bitcoin to hbkg i sent similar bitcoin to 1clg and u

488
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,679
bitcoin address so this will be

489
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,200
the very important

490
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,299
bitcore address for this story

491
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,360
then hpfass for recovery purpose

492
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,080


493
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,080
So my initial hypothesis was that

494
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,840
I created a system to monitor the current 1 bkeg and 1 clg,

495
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,880
but if the bitcoin

496
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,520
address was changed, the

497
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,500
system would stop functioning.

498
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,000
However

499
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160


500
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,440
, since we were operating a circular bitcoin address, we hypothesized that

501
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,600
when the IPC signal was moved, it would be

502
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,299
collected and sent to the next fender, and then

503
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,520
it could be detected when it was sent to the next IP signal.

504
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440


505
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,100


506
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,580
I

507
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,860
will show the results of the verification in a

508
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,299
graph.

509
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,919
I used an OSS called Jeffy.

510
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,440
The concentration

511
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,780
represents the bitcoin address, and the edge

512
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,000
represents the transaction.

513
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,220
Arrows from the sender to the receiver

514
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,940
From November 15, 2019 to

515
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,320
mid to late 300,000, collect bitcoins from 1BK1 and 1

516
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,440
clg to 1pfs, move

517
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080


518
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
all the

519
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
bitcoins to a disposable bitcoin address, and

520
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,000
from here

521
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,980
Cianci  -Sama's IP address was hidden

522
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,059
Bitcoin

523
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,820
was sent to the HB system maintenance, and the rest was transferred to a disposable

524
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,700
Bitcoin address.

525
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,360


526
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,000


527
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,580
I

528
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,220


529
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,500
'm sorry about the bitcoin address, but it can be seen from the bitcoin operation

530
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,740
. I also confirmed that

531
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,179
the argument of the blockchain API that

532
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,400
Shimaruya hit changed from hpk1 to 1clg

533
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
.

534
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,280
In addition, there was a big movement,

535
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,880
and bitcoins were recovered from 1bkg and 1clg to

536
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,860
hpfs,

537
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,600
but the

538
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,880
bitcoin address for the purpose of recovery

539
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,320
changed from hpfs to

540
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,160


541
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,900


542
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,500
1NQ4R.  Changed The

543
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
bitcoin addresses added here are

544
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,600
19Hi8 and 1N94R. This is also

545
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,780
written in the paper

546
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,919
. Finally, it was changed to a

547
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,840
very simplified bitcoin address

548
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,379
operation. The

549
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,140
role of sending and collecting was changed to 1NQ4R.

550
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,280
1BK1 sorry after ibcgnal

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,860
is changed from

552
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,520
1clg to 1bkg and there are 1NQ4, so send bitcoin to 1PKG and 1KJ 8 and save

553
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,140
it

554
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,960
and return it to 1 yen QR.

555
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,640


556
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,020


557
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,660
As I said

558
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,179
at the beginning, once a

559
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,380
block chain Trump action is

560
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,080
approved by a miner,

561
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,059


562
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,160
it cannot be tampered with or deleted, even by law enforcement agencies,

563
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,559
and this Bitcoin transaction is money

564
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,179
laundering.  It's not a crime, so the

565
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,500
point is, you're just transferring your own bitcoin

566
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,460


567
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,440
from a bitcoin address managed by an attacker to a bitcoin address managed by an attacker.

568
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,340


569
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,900


570
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,340


571
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,299


572
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,559


573
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,360


574
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,699


575
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,080
So, from here

576
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,480
, we're going to get into the essence of this story.The way we did it this time

577
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,860


578
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,539
was very clever,

579
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,220
but there was a design mistake that allowed

580
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,840
anyone to assign their

581
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,659
favorite IP address to Maria whenever they wanted.  We

582
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,240
were able to send them to the meeting place.

583
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,740


584
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,539


585
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,740
It's

586
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,360
because we didn't check the

587
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,460
addresses. After we set up the takeover,

588
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,980
the evasive action taken by the attackers was very simple.

589
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,360


590
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,340


591
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,539


592
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,880
We changed it,

593
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,020
so

594
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,120
we could continue to send the bitcoin address to the recipient,

595
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,179
but

596
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,440
Maria would

597
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
n't read the transaction.

598
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,260


599
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,480
used three blockchain APIs

600
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,100


601
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,880


602
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,860


603
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,240


604
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,980


605
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,380
: Blockchain.info, Blockcipher.com, and Coinmarketcap APIs, but here we show Blockchain.info's API.

606
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,880


607
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,580
We were doing it, but

608
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,799
it

609
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,860
changed to 1NQ4R after we took

610
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,020
over.The specification was to look at the two most recent transactions

611
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,200


612
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000


613
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,460
.

614
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,740
So

615
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,080


616
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,419
, even at Black Hat, we

617
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,240
talked about how the takeover was sealed,

618
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,340
but

619
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,640
when I was compiling this

620
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,720
slide for Code Blue, I sent it to this place.  I realized that if I wrote it

621
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,460


622
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,280
down, I would have been able to induce it again, and I feel like I failed

623
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,080


624
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,440


625
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,919
.  So

626
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,700
, the

627
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,799
evasion code I predicted was different,

628
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,720
and I thought it would move the IP signal

629
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,340
, so this

630
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,960


631
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520


632
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,640
actually

633
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,960
confirmed the move from 1clg to

634
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,140
1BKEG about 9 months before the takeover.  I couldn't buy the attacker's IP signal after launching a large-scale sabotage, even though it was supposed to,

635
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,580


636
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,320


637
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,840
so the

638
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,879
monitoring system I created continued to function effectively

639
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,500


640
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,620


641
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,960
.  On the other hand, first of all,

642
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,120


643
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,380


644
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,360
I predicted that IP signals would be changed as an evasive action when

645
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,240
sabotaging an attacker, but the verification results can be

646
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,740
changed.

647
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,260
So when I dig a little deeper and

648
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,400
think about it,

649
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,659
I've come to the conclusion that even if I wanted to buy it, I couldn't change

650
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:31,919


651
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,940


652
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,919
it.

653
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,960


654
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,980


655
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,299
I think it's easy to create a

656
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,320


657
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
bitcoin address,

658
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,140
but I

659
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,480
think

660
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,140


661
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,159
it

662
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:47,760
would

663
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,860
take a lot of effort to prepare a corresponding bitcoin

664
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,320
address.  But in

665
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,880
the case of bitcoin addresses, you

666
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,220
have to calculate and create them yourself.

667
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,380


668
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,299


669
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,520


670
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,159
Well, I don't know, so recently cyber-attacks

671
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,620
and business aspects have emerged, so if the

672
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,500
cost is not justified, the attackers wo

673
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,100
n't do it.

674
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,940


675
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,059
Well, the process

676
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,260
of making predictions, formulating hypotheses, and then

677
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,120
verifying them is

678
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,440
important.

679
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,539


680
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:25,260


681
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,880


682
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,460


683
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,840
In defense, it is possible

684
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,659


685
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:35,279
to predict and

686
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,480
verify the

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,100
pattern that the attacker will cause, and even if it fails, the

688
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,380
result may

689
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,820


690
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,740


691
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,960
be that the attacker could not have done it.  So that's the second

692
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,200
thing that I got

693
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,720
, and the third thing that I'm

694
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,799


695
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,080
going to talk about is awareness of the link between

696
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,000


697
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,539
cyberattacks and global events.  The

698
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,919


699
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,600
upper line graph shows

700
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,700
changes in the fees set by the attacker for transactions

701
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,919
. The

702
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,299
lower Lessen graph

703
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,799


704
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,740
shows the time period during which the attacker made transactions

705
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,320
.  So, the

706
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,279
lower part shows the

707
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,159
midnight hours and the upper part shows the

708
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:23,880


709
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,500
daytime hours.It's UTC.The first thing I

710
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,520


711
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,100
explained was the Bitcoin halving in May 2020. What

712
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,080
is the

713
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,419
debitcoin halving?  and the

714
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,179
reward that the system pays to miners is

715
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,880
half  This happens once every four years,

716
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,500
when a certain number of blocks are reached

717
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,400


718
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,679


719
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,820


720
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,460


721
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,840
, and from the point of view of the mining business, the rewards generated by the Bitcoin system

722
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,860


723
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,600
are halved.  In

724
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,039


725
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,600


726
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,039


727
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,620
fact, I heard that some businesses went out of business during this period.In that case

728
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,900


729
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,779


730
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,520
, the mining capacity of the system as a whole would

731
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,779
decrease, so

732
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,640
Trump action would be necessary.

733
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
There was a market price for the fees to be

734
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,940
set.The point is that the price soared like this.If you

735
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,679
don't set a slightly higher fee,

736
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,900
you wo

737
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,419
n't be able to mine.Thinking from the attacker's side

738
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,179
, this fee is  In other words,

739
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,940
it becomes costly, so if the price goes up, the profit will go down.

740
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,179


741
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,679


742
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,380


743
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,880


744
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,260


745
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,620
It seems that there is something like that, so

746
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,720
I changed the time period. Well, this

747
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,900
is the explanation I gave in Blackout, but I noticed

748
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,039
that the order was reversed

749
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,620
.  I

750
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,820
wrote down my IP address, but it changed at the end of May 2020, about an

751
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,400
hour after my lunch break in Japan time.

752
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,080


753
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,480


754
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,640


755
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
In the phone call I made with him, he said that although he brought up that topic,

756
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,600


757
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,460
he didn't know the cause.

758
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,000
So, as a result of digging deep into various data from various perspectives, I

759
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,220


760
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,500


761
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,659
found out that there was a time when commissions soared.

762
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,700
So, using that as a trigger,

763
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,919
I was researching the fee market, and

764
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,220
I found out about the Bitcoin halving

765
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,020
, and one of the ways to keep fees down

766
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,480
is to change the time period

767
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,080
.  I was neither a Bitcoin

768
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,220
expert nor a blockchain expert

769
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,919


770
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,080
, so I was doing it in a style where I looked up every time something happened.

771
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,260


772
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,940


773
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,460


774
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,980
If you know in advance that there is a bitcoin half-life itself,  I think that at

775
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,980
the moment the change occurred, I could have doubted the relationship, the

776
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,720
causal relationship, so

777
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,520
recent cyberattacks are

778
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,799
related to global events, and they

779
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,200
are trying to make money efficiently.

780
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,520


781
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,080
For example, unfortunately, there is a war going on right now

782
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,220


783
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,440


784
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,820


785
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,580


786
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,919


787
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,120


788
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,919
.  At first glance, it has nothing to do with the previous

789
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,620
Ossession, but

790
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,480
I wonder if it's important to be conscious of the fact that what's happening in the world like this may actually

791
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,340
be related from afar

792
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,899


793
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,880
.  Here's

794
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,360
what I got

795
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,940
. So from here, I

796
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,200


797
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,059
'm going to tell you a

798
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,020
short,

799
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,720
great story that will only give you

800
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,100
a

801
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,279
simple

802
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,960
sorry essence.  I was

803
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,100
planning to talk a lot here, but I wrote a lot in the

804
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,559
first half, but the volume became

805
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,840
too large, so I

806
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,240
will only talk about the essence.

807
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,340


808
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,320
Behind this

809
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,820
,

810
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,539
there is a desire to improve thinking and

811
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:13,799
to deal with troubles

812
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,380
.

813
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,720


814
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880


815
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
Because it was rough, the

816
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
attacker tried to do something about it,

817
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,820
and wrote down the trading time.The

818
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,320


819
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,120
second case

820
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,120
study I talked about in the Blackout performance was in April 2020, and

821
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,140


822
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,480
there was a change in block selection strategy.

823
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,260
That's right. In this

824
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,419
attack, you must have the two Trump actions

825
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,059
approved in

826
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,399
order.

827
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,899


828
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,820


829
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,080
As a result,

830
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,220


831
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,380
Maruya will not be able to communicate with the C&C

832
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,140


833
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,120
server.In principle, blocks are generated once every 10 minutes,

834
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,679
so

835
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,919
for example

836
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,899
, confirm that the first transaction is approved.  Second,

837
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,820
try to approve the transaction from  And

838
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,919
the time lag of 10 minutes or more will always

839
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,620
be sung.The attackers

840
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,120
seemed to be very worried about

841
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,860
that.And the fifth

842
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,299
story is that the attackers also make operational mistakes.

843
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,480


844
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,039
I

845
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,200
have to approve two transactions in order

846
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,159
, and sometimes the attacker sends

847
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,020
money and only one transaction

848
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,600
comes out.As far as I know, there

849
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,559


850
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,020
were six transactions.

851
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,620
3 out of the 6 occurred

852
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,059
when the bitcoin address structure was changed in December 2019,

853
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,980
so it was

854
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,039
probably a test transmission remittance, and the remaining

855
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,120
3 were

856
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,320
simple erroneous

857
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,520
remittances.  I would like to talk about one of these in detail,

858
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,000
but this transaction at 8:39 on July 24, 2020

859
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,440


860
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,520
is

861
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,580
Bacillus subtilis.

862
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,020


863
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,580


864
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,100
It doesn't exist, and in the first place,

865
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,600
it's replaced with the IP address that was set before that, so if

866
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,940
you

867
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,020


868
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,940
think about it from the attacker's site,

869
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,980
incorrect remittance is not a big problem, just replace the

870
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,840
correct IP address with the

871
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,399
two most recent transactions.

872
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,700
It's just a story, but from my

873
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,240
site's point of view, it's a pretty big problem, and as I said

874
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,179
earlier, when you want to analyze something,

875
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,220


876
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,440
you do time series analysis many times from the first transaction to the most recent transaction

877
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,659
.

878
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,580


879
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,399


880
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,720
I don't think the successor knows anything about it

881
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,059
, but since it's a bit of a nuisance because if you make a mistake, you'll be off by one, so

882
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,799
I'm already aware of the erroneous remittance the moment it happens.

883
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,500


884
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,039


885
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,520
So the sixth open thing is

886
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,820
to collect data for as long as possible.

887
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,039
This attacker has

888
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,100
updated the CRC server about 200 times for about a year without any

889
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
problems.  I made it a success. During the two weeks

890
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,700
of Christmas vacation at the end of the year,

891
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,519
I

892
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,279
was able to gracefully continue to attack.

893
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,880


894
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,340


895
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,799


896
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,659
Having the right data makes the

897
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,720
research much more persuasive.

898
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,700
In order to collect data for a long period of

899
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,880
time, it is necessary to think carefully about the design, and in this case

900
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,919


901
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,299
, there was a limit on the number of transactions in the

902
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,340
blockchain API, so there was only 50 transactions at one time

903
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,100
.  On my

904
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,080
side, I prepared a JSON file that I managed myself,

905
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,100
and when a

906
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,679
new transaction was added, I added

907
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,659


908
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,059


909
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,279


910
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,720


911
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,380
it to that file.  I skipped that during the analysis, so

912
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,919
let's get into the

913
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,860
summary.

914
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,080


915
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,540


916
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,119


917
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,960


918
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,260
The

919
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,260


920
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,800
first one, which I have been talking about in a structure that conveys know-how, is that, as an ethical consideration, in

921
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,239
our problem,

922
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,460


923
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,918
there was a consideration that the victims who should be

924
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,899
protected should not be involved.  Sometimes

925
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,480
, if we overlook it,

926
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320


927
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,839
there may be problems that could show our team, so

928
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,780


929
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,659
we need to carefully examine it.

930
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,060
In terms of cyber security, the

931
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,280
verification process itself is important, and it is important to

932
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,679


933
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,260
anticipate and verify in advance several behavioral patterns

934
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,000


935
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,560
that

936
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,060


937
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,240
attackers will adopt.  The 4th and 5th points are in a

938
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,820
contrasting relationship, and the

939
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,160
novelty of this attack was high, so the

940
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,240


941
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,540
attackers attacked frequently and evolved their methods.

942
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,380


943
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,060


944
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,280
There are things like wanting to make things better or dealing with troubles,

945
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,619
so when something

946
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,320
changes, it's necessary to straighten out the threads immediately.

947
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,680


948
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,359


949
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,400
Because I didn't do it, the

950
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,720
attacker made a normal operation mistake.It is necessary to recognize that

951
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,560


952
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,420
an operation mistake was a mistake the moment it

953
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,800


954
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,579


955
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:33,960


956
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,900
was made.And then, well, this attack proof was very

957
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,300
good, so it took more than a year.

958
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
In that case,

959
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,579
the design itself to collect data over a long period of time will also

960
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,940
be important.

961
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,020
I would like to conclude

962
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,740


963
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,359


964
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,400


965
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,160
by talking about the cultivation of attacks that exploit this block point by digging deeper into the awareness of the relationship between

966
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,180


967
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,940


968
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,140


969
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,820
cyberattacks and global events.

970
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,380
Let's say,

971
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,599


972
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,000
even if you use 100,000 Satoshi to convert the IP address of the new Anshin server, this

973
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,680
will not be a cost

974
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,560
. Just by copying the asset,

975
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,640


976
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,800
you will have to pay a fee to have this transaction approved.  This is a

977
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,140
cost, so I understand that

978
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,460
the market price was about 30,000 when the takeover took

979
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,339
place, but

980
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,380
during the Bitcoin half-life, this

981
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,619
rose to about 67,000.

982
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,460
The big event is

983
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,660
, of course, Bitcoin counterattack, but there is

984
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,560


985
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,740
also the fact that Bitcoin is soaring.

986
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,900
When we launched a takeover, it was

987
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,940
about

988
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,619


989
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,660
10,000 dollars per hbt.

990
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,460
When the infrastructure was abandoned,

991
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,980
it jumped up to 6 times. This means, for example

992
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,320


993
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,900
, even if 30,000 Satoshi was enough to approve the transaction, when there was

994
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,400
resistance, it was advancing in sandals, but when it

995
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,460


996
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,420
actually

997
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,339
abandoned its attack infrastructure, it was 18.  If

998
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:06,240
you don't pay a dollar,

999
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,680


1000
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,240
you can't update the IP address of the Cyancie server. The

1001
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,800
attackers don't spend money only here,

1002
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
but they buy servers,

1003
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,820
pay electricity bills,

1004
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,800
buy tools, and so

1005
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,579


1006
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,220
on.  If it doesn't come out, this attack infrastructure

1007
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,500
will lose its appeal, so

1008
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,599


1009
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,880
I think it's a little less promising to

1010
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,260


1011
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,500
use this blockchain for this phishing attack.

1012
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,700
But I don't think it

1013
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,800
will be used unless it's at least under $10,000, but on the

1014
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,359


1015
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,640
other hand,

1016
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,859
a botnet called Group TVer

1017
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,060


1018
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,280
has been raging for a long time, and it embeds commands in the function called

1019
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,020
OPReturn that I mentioned at the beginning.

1020
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,480
It's a type

1021
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,900
, but by the end of 2021,

1022
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,520


1023
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,980
Google has declared that it will be fighting for about a year, and that direction

1024
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,380
is  I think the threat is still going on,

1025
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,480
so I'd like to close this park in the hope that

1026
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,500


1027
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,140
the knowledge we've gained this time, well, that sort of thing, will be useful against that kind of threat

1028
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,980


1029
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,560


1030
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,420


1031
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,770


1032
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,770
.

1033
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,700
Thank you very much.

1034
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,740


1035
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,420


1036
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,599


1037
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,540


1038
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,240


1039
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,760
The question was whether there was any kind of access harassment, etc.

1040
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,119


1041
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,500


1042
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,060
It actually became quite a problem internally

1043
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,579


1044
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,020


1045
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,380
.
