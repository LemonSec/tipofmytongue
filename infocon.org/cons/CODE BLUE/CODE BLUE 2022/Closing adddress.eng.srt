Hello everyone. I

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,660
'm Kana Shinoda. How was your two days? Did you enjoy yourself?

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,300


4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,099


5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,460


6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,740


7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,340


8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,880


9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,560


10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,360
These are the people who have supported Code Blue this time

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,600
.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,540
Without these people, an event of this scale would not have been possible

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,620
. On

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,239


15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,420
behalf of the secretariat, and also on

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,980
behalf of the

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,120
customers,

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,200


19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,360
I would like to express my sincere gratitude.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,079
Thank you very much to all the communist companies.

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,479
[Applause] And

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,400
to all the speakers

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,100


24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,340


25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,560


26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600


27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,180


28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,260

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,580


30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,920
Thank you very much

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,600


32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
for your application

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,920


34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,740


35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,119


36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040


37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,100
.  ]

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,340
Also, to all the participants, it's

39
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,820
been three years since we've had an event of this scale due to the coronavirus, but

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820


41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,479


42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,340


43
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,320
many people have come to see it, and many people are watching it online.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640


45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640


46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,500


47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,200
Thank you very much. Real people have

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,000
quite a lot of capacity, so we had to

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560


50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,060
close the deadline quickly at the very end,

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,819


52
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,160
so those who couldn't come.  I'm really sorry.

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,379
I hope next year will be a little more normal

54
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,080


55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,459
. Thank you very much

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,859


57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,739


58
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,540


59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,780
to all the participants.  I heard that it was quite a success,

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,500
right? Also,

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,360
there was actually a free drink there, but

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,640


63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,480


64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
it actually sold 1.5 times more, and it sold 1.5 times

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160


66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,620
more.

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,360


68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,540


69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,440


70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,540


71
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,379
Thank you.  I

72
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,720
think it's at the counter or somewhere, so I heard that you

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,019
were able to wear 20 precious NFTs to commemorate the visitor,

74
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:10,920


75
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,739
so it's only 20, so if

76
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,599
you don't

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560


78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,300
mind, please scan it later and get it only here.  I think it

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,599
's good that they haven't distributed it yet

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,879
. First of all, I looked back on the past 10 years and

81
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,480


82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
made various attempts

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,860


84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,900


85
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,680


86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
.  Kuroyone

87
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,400
said he would come

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,480


89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,540
back, but he was

90
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,360
the first student, right? He's the first student staff member.

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,560


92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480


93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,780
If it

94
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,700
wasn't for him, he would

95
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,980
not have been born among the student staff

96
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,700
. Thank you.

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,099


98
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,400


99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,860


100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,978


101
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,139


102
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,000
I think

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,380
the reason why I created Defensive Knock was that I wanted to not limit myself to the hacking community, but to include network people and people working in the network

104
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,600
.

105
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
I haven't done it for 10 years,

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,139
but thanks to the nearly 10 years that I've been doing, I'm now

107
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,160
a Code Blue participant in wide projects and other things, and

108
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199


109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,280


110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,419


111
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,100
now I'm in a situation where

112
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,040


113
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,780
Code Blue students are crossing over.  People and

114
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,340
network people

115
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,860
have come to interact with each other, and this is

116
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,300
important.

117
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,639
Now, even if you go to Web3, you have to think about cryptography,

118
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,440
networks, and various other things all at once,

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,940
so I'm

120
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,320
sure you'll hear about this crossover.

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,259
Thank you very much for

122
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,660
taking on this challenge

123
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,300


124
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,759


125
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,320


126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,060


127
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,199


128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,000


129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,240
of CB.  We

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,540
didn't have a gathering like this last year.As you can see today,

131
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,160
there are a lot of people from overseas, and there are

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,900
probably

133
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,820
people from overseas living in Tokyo,

134
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,740
but we didn't have a place like this

135
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,740


136
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,180
.  Hey everyone,

137
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,039
I think it's really

138
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,039
good that we were able to create this kind of meeting.I wonder what it was like to

139
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,520
break the taboo in Japan.I

140
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,300


141
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,759
couldn't talk about 0 days and things

142
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,660


143
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,400


144
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,960


145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,240
like that.

146
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,400
Thanks to everyone's cooperation, I

147
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,139
've been here for 10 years, and

148
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,699
without everyone's cooperation

149
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,680


150
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,500


151
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,900
,

152
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm

153
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,139
really grateful.

154
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,300
Thank you to everyone online. Thank you to everyone who

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,620
participated in the real

156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,660


157
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,860


158
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,160


159
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,160


160
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,280


161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,199


162
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,060
world.  Report from CB team

163
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,340
Let's run, let's run

164
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,380
[Applause]

165
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,810
[Music]

166
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,560
[Applause]

167
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,620
I've been wanting to talk about this first, and it's

168
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,860


169
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,259
been a while CB6 is starting to be active, so I'm

170
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,080
talking about this network

171
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,460
I think it's

172
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,460


173
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,780
better to

174
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,740


175
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,180


176
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,520


177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,319
open it.

178
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,880
Well, um, it's the same as what Kana-san said

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,860
earlier, so let's

180
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,120
skip that part.

181
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,699


182
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,560


183
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,139


184
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,400


185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
As of 2019, we've done quite a bit of

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,460


187
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,979
things, such as distributing global IP addresses to everyone

188
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,120


189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,800
, creating a Socks team,

190
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,380
and ensuring security

191
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,479


192
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,699
.  Sometimes the way everyone uses

193
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,199
it has changed.

194
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,680


195
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000


196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500


197
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,139


198
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,639


199
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,440
I just thought that there was no choice but to make one 10-gear,

200
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,319


201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,720
so I made it to 10GB

202
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,060
.  Just by applying it to the way it is used, it will

203
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,160
be something new.

204
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,900
Let's

205
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,819
move on to the next page.

206
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,220


207
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,080


208
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,940


209
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm going to do it, so

210
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm going to explain it in a little more detail. Please go to the

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,819
next page

212
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,199


213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,259


214
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,060
.

215
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,160
It sounds like a rock, but it's

216
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,900
like DEFCON, and

217
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,879
I'm looking at it with a smile like that, but this

218
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,660
is also an

219
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,120
attack, isn't it?

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,500


221
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,360


222
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,159
Some people have already been inflamed. People who have been

223
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,760


224
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,979
blundered probably because of this attack. It's a

225
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,559
pity.

226
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,540


227
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,720


228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,580
Although I thought about it, I didn't kick it in the end,

229
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,019
but I

230
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,820
think it's interesting because it's like Code Bull.

231
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,260
Thank you for giving me a good experience

232
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,600


233
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,680


234
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,019
.

235
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,080
There was someone

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,660


237
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,420
who was attacked by the classic method

238
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,120


239
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,920
of blowing an SSID called Code Blue outside of our access point, and

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,300
it felt very nostalgic.  I

241
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,160
wonder if this ended without kicking this too I won't kick this

242
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,959


243
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,660
either I thought it would be nice

244
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,700
to see this with a smile on my face It's

245
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,720
really fun Okay,

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
let's go next Let's go here

247
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,580
Well,

248
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,920
there was a person who threw thousands

249
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,300


250
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
of dls queries in that second

251
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,720


252
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,880
.  By the way, the

253
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,260
number of requests was limited, and

254
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,060
DNS was also restarted.

255
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,279


256
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,420


257
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,019


258
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,880


259
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,740


260
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
Well then, let's move on to the next one. Well, that's why

261
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,180
we, the various Code Blue

262
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,680
network teams,

263
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,019
have had a lot of experiences while

264
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,080


265
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,420
doing various activities.

266
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,920


267
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,480
I think it's about time that we have to replace it, and

268
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,420
we're really looking for people who can rank high in the Code Blue CB country

269
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,060
, especially in the

270
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,380
area of

271
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,480
security and infrastructure.

272
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,100
If you want to try something,

273
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,740


274
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,940
I would definitely like to have

275
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,100


276
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,980
someone who

277
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,899
has a

278
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,820
passion to join us.  If so,

279
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,339
we would like to have you in the Senate and work with us to

280
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,839
make Code Blue even more exciting

281
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:37,500
.

282
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,700


283
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,950


284
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,479


285
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,320


286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,620


287
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,000


288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,480
R&D subsidies are provided to excellent presenters

289
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,440


290
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,540


291
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,579
Yu Arai from the Review Board will report on this year's Youth Track lecture

292
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,779
slots.

293
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,940


294
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,760
Thank

295
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,279


296
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,380
you very much

297
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,480
for coming to the venue and watching it

298
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,399
online

299
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,180


300
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,800


301
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,640


302
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,920
.

303
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,220
The volunteers, the

304
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,500
actual participants, and the

305
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,579
online young people have been there three times, and they have made this

306
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,420
conference

307
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,380


308
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,600


309
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,320
lively.

310
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,720
We want to support the initiative to present the research we are working on, so

311
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,240


312
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,380
we

313
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,279


314
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
started this initiative called U25.

315
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,500


316
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,380


317
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,700


318
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,800


319
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,500


320
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,200


321
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,940
We have been giving them the opportunity to present their research, and especially this time, we have given them the opportunity to present their findings.

322
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,399


323
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,800
I have set

324
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,279
this up, so

325
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,360
could you please give a round of applause to both of you?

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,160


327
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120


328
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,500


329
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500


330
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,180


331
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,519


332
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,480
They have come back

333
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,980


334
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,839
quite a bit, and even within this U25 effort, the

335
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,180
number has increased considerably compared to last

336
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,959
year, and these two people were selected

337
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,019


338
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,700
, and I'm here to talk about this.  I have talked about both of you in various ways on

339
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,220
this review board,

340
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,680


341
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,800


342
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,959
and it has been

343
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,100
recognized that each of you is

344
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,019


345
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,360
doing extremely excellent research.  I've

346
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,420


347
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,440


348
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,880
prepared a reward for you to come

349
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,220
to me, so I'd like to give you a

350
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,339


351
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:01,779


352
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,399
little lesson here.

353
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,060


354
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,199


355
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,969
[Applause]

356
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,160
First of all, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to present on such a big stage

357
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,740


358
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,500


359
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,240


360

368
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,660
I would like to stand on the stage of Code Blue again in the technical section and the general section.For

369
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,440
two days.  Thank you.

370

376
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,540


377
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,720


378
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,859


379
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,579


380
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,259


381
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,240


382

386
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,519
Next, we will introduce the workshops that took place over the past two days, and the awards ceremony for the contest. First, let's try this workshop provided by Hitachi Systems, Ltd.

387
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,579


388
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:09,780
[Applause]

389
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,959
Hello everyone, this is Hitachi Systems.  It's the

390
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,540
10th anniversary of Code Blue, and we, Hitachi

391
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,740
Systems, have

392
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,559
been cooperating for 10 years

393
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,020
.

394
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,319
Let's see, let's

395
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,079
do it ttx This is the

396
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,860
first time we

397
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,679
've deployed this, and when a

398
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,080
security incident occurs

399
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
, what we need to think about in order to continue business as an organization

400
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,679


401
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,820
is

402
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,640
very short.  It takes about 10 minutes to assign a role and

403
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,740
have a

404
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,440
discussion.

405
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,760


406
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,380


407
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,260


408
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,860


409
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,460
There weren't many

410
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,299
scenarios

411
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,720


412
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,380


413
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,240
, so I asked them to ad-lib the things that were

414
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,260
n't written, but

415
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,140
everyone was quite active.

416
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,860


417
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,299


418
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,100


419
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,960
At first, it was planned to have 4 people at a time, 4 people at a time, a total of

420
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,500
4 times, but there were a

421
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,820
lot of people saying they wanted to do it, so

422
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,380


423
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,640
we increased it to 7 times, and

424
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,580
more than 30 people.

425
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,760
Thank you very much for your experience,

426
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,580
and your impressions, too.

427
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,799


428
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,020


429
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,860


430
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,660


431
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,020


432
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,360


433
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,260


434
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,660


435
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,419


436
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,080
I hope that you enjoyed your feedback, and I think that we were able to liven up the 10th anniversary of Code Blue together as a sponsor.

437
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,660


438
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,299


439
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,200
Thank you very

440

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,700


442
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,020


443
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,100


444
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,539


445
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,020
much.

446

447
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,080


448
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,280


449
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,100
Thank you.

450
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,480
Due to adult circumstances, the

451
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,880
company name has changed a little. It's a little

452
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
long, but please take this opportunity to remember it and go home

453
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,620
.

454
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,620


455
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,600


456
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760


457
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,620


458
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,940
For

459
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,799


460
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,179
beginners, it's

461
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,400
easy to understand that SK Injection  Try attacking vulnerabilities that

462
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,860
you often hear about, such as operating system command injection

463
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,520
and operations outside of your authority, with

464
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,200
your own hands.

465
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,500


466
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,440


467
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,840


468
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,880


469
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840


470
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,960
We had 53 people participate, and I

471
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,840
think about half of them

472
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,879


473
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,400
answered all the questions correctly.  For those of you who are in the second week,

474
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900


475
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,419


476
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,220
I gave you a wonderful book written by one of our engineers.

477
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,919
Thank you very much for participating

478
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,160


479
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,080


480
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,059
.  So, I

481
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,039
really wanted you to come to the stage, but I'm sorry. Please give me a round of

482
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,120


483
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,340
applause.

484
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,030
Thank you everyone.

485
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,720
[Applause]

486
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,340
Thank you very much

487
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,559


488
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,419


489
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,980
.

490
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,820


491
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,559


492
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,840
Well, this time

493
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,640
,

494
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,880
we held a contest as a CTF related to connected cars.

495
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,740
As a team, seven teams participated

496
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,020
three times, and those who participated three times on-site, and

497
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,240
those who participated remotely.

498
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,620


499
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,020
I would like to ask

500
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,480


501
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,299


502
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,039


503
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,080
you to show us the next

504
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,960
slide

505
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,240


506
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,580
.  It was done in the style of simulating end-to-end and

507
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,140
attacking it,

508
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,940


509
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,159
but that's exactly what I was aiming

510
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,600
for,

511
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
and the difference from normal CTF is that it uses a real emulator.

512
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,520


513
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,919


514
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,360


515
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,760


516
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,679
I received a variety of comments, such as

517
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,059
that

518
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,460
it was interesting, or that it was educational to learn that cyber-attacks against automobiles in recent years have diversified.  It stood out, so we had a

519
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,500
lot of people take pictures of

520
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580


521
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,460
it, and I think it was very good for us to hold this event this time.

522
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,260
Actually, there are some people on the management team over there who have helped

523
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,780


524
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,039
me write a little bit,

525
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,720
but if you

526
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,540
don't mind, I'd like it if you could understand a little bit

527
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,299
[Applause]

528
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,980
Continuing with this contest.

529
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,059


530
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,179
I would like to announce the ranking from

531
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,600
3rd place, so the 3rd place will be

532
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,299
Rick Sex,

533
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,179
and then the 2nd place will be

534
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,980
Dr. Run

535
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,020
, and the 1st place will be

536
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,260
EX.

537
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,919
We

538

551
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,799
It was a disappointing result of 33rd place this time

552
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,020
, but I had to participate midway through the second day

573
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,600
I'm the leader of LAC Co., Ltd., a repeat tech company. This was my first time

574
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,860
participating in a car-related CTF.

575

595
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,120
airport, so there will be an after party after the

596
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,380
networking party, so I'm sure there are some people who don't know where

597
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,720
it is, so please ask the staff on the first floor

598
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,679


599
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,020

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,400
.

601
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,020
I would appreciate it if you could extend the party too. It was

00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,340
PwC Consulting. Thank
