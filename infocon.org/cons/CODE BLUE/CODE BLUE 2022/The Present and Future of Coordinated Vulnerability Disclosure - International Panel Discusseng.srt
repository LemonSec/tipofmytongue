1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,760
thank you for the introduction I am

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,759
Takahashi lawyer

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,560
so today we will talk about the

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,360
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,980
present and future

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,560
from Japan we have Mr itabashi uh

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,380
the information promotion agency and EU

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,660
Mr Lawrence olpupilo and from the US

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,640
Allen Friedman

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,260
so I will give a brief introduction so

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,380
vulnerability what is vulnerability

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,760
yeah

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,960
this will be introduced later so early

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,780
warning partnership

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,239
this is defined under Japan early

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,640
warning partnership computer virus

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,700
computer unauthorized access

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,960
security weakness where the

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,579
functionality of performance can be

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,920
impacted by an attack such as computer

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,059
virus or unauthorized computer access

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,219
in ISO

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,280
has a definition too

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,479
so

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,240
foreign

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,460
what is the meaning of vulnerability in

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,340
the current current Society

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,619
so when we think of cyber security this

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,659
is a very important word so cyber

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,080
threats

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,380
it's like a fuel or something that

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,520
triggers cyber threats that is my view

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,119
so

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,579
for who will this be an opportunity

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,920
it is the criminals which have been

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,159
talked about yesterday and today and the

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,259
states countries

38
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,360
uh as threat is also drawing attention

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,759
and direct involvement of the government

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,579
happens in some cases so when this

41
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,680
vulnerability is detected what action

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,460
should be taken

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,720
so from the past

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,200
full disclosure uh

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,219
is required

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
the attacker is known so to protect from

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
the attackers we need to share

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,420
information that is the line of thinking

49
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,180
but there are other views

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,180
others say full disclosure

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
so this may lead to the abuse of the

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,220
tools so we need the information sharing

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,580
in the responsible manner some say so

54
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,459
more than 20 years ago this discussion

55
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,180
was held

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,940
so

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,760
on this discussion the current present

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,340
state is

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,560
the theme of today

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
so this is the direction we need to move

62
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,660
into

63
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,879
and this is now becoming a reality

64
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,360
various Frameworks are established in

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,099
Japan Europe and the US

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
this vulnerability disclosure framework

67
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,680
it has difficulties

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
so as I mentioned at the outset the full

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,599
disclosure and the responsible

70
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,860
disclosure are up against each other so

71
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,370
oh this is a complex matter

72
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,519
[Music]

73
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,620
from these three areas we invited three

74
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,640
experts in uh in the actual practice uh

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,560
who will share with us the current

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,340
State and how we should counter this

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,519
matter

78
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,379
so that is the motivation or the purpose

79
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,040
of this International Symposium

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,560
panel so Lawrence could you explain eu's

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
situation Lawrence the Sun the floor is

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,560
yours

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
okay

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,660
um thank you very much first of all let

85
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,280
me thank you

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,040
um Eco for putting the this panel and

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,139
the uh kind of you know for the

88
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,500
organization and to invite us here to

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,479
report this panel

90
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,479
um I am an associate senior research

91
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,540
fellow accepts is a center of European

92
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,360
policy studies in Brussels it's a team

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,060
tank and we have been working on a

94
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,199
software and B is Cruiser since 2018

95
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,780
because we started doing a task force

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,720
with basically an

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,479
multi-stakeholder Gathering of of a

98
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,060
company's new institution Academia civil

99
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,840
society and we did an analysis of what

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,840
was the situation uh safaris

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,320
vulnerabilities goes a policy in Europe

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,600
and we basically found that you know

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,620
that um uh the only two countries in

104
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,300
that time where

105
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,759
uh had in place of vulnerabilities

106
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,180
Cruiser policies but that work was

107
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,479
important because triggered uh studies

108
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,080
from minisa also some

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,419
policy response in terms of legislation

110
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,660
at the EU level today we're going to

111
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,419
present briefly the studies we've done

112
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,460
foreign

113
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,320
on this on this matter this study was

114
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,139
done jointly with the wave external

115
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,720
consulting company

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,060
some people from Minnesota itself

117
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,520
and briefly I will cover these three

118
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
topic current state of play ocbd parties

119
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
in the EU key finding and overview

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,740
challenges addition CBD National

121
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,900
policies

122
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,300
um but what is the current status of

123
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,419
preo cvd policy as you can see from this

124
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,520
map when we started uh you know only two

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,000
countries basically in 2018 only friends

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,300
and the Netherlands vulnerability

127
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,699
discuss a policy in place but what is

128
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,919
also interesting to note is that while

129
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
in the in the Netherlands

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,460
researcher to some extent were free

131
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,680
given some condition to discuss

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,560
vulnerability they didn't have to pass

133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,220
through like cyber security agency or or

134
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,400
intelligent agency instead in France you

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,919
know researchers where to some extent

136
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,840
protected but only the conditions they

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,380
were using contacting

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,060
and discussion would not be through the

139
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,180
intelligence agency in NC okay

140
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,300
so what what we have done in our study

141
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,060
we we have checked what was the

142
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,440
situation in 2010 and we found that

143
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,300
basically uh four members uh already had

144
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,500
impressed this policy basically

145
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,080
France the Netherlands

146
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,780
Belgium and

147
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,539
Lithuania okay 10 members

148
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,280
where um

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,039
10 countries were in the process of

150
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,620
doing that and the nine members had not

151
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,520
implemented at all a cvd policy

152
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,819
these are you know tells you briefly if

153
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,479
you want you can think about who are

154
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,940
these members these states you know if

155
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,620
you know because we have no time to go

156
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,380
over but it's very clear that you know

157
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,000
there are some countries are real

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,099
Advantage some other notes but things

159
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,699
are moving moving in the direction of

160
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,220
having coordinator will be disclosure

161
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,319
all over

162
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,599
Europe

163
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,180
what we do what are the key finding on

164
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,060
this study on CBD policy at the national

165
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,339
level

166
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,539
we using also a study done by the

167
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,520
definition by the oecd we have asked you

168
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,799
know which of the following processes of

169
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,080
the vulnerability treatment life cycle

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,019
you can see more critical Discovery

171
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,560
handling management public disclosure we

172
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,000
can see very clearly that the management

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,640
and handling of vulnerabilities cross

174
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,040
are considered the most critical this is

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
interesting because say that let's say

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,660
the the Discover the the disclosing are

177
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,480
considered less less critical because

178
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,240
probably the very issue is if we

179
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,880
describe what we are going to do I will

180
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,040
to manage this process okay and so it's

181
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,540
the process it's more critical

182
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,200
um

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,800
we find also we ask what uh what weared

184
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,380
in the current good practice on CBD

185
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,800
policy in the EU and we found that in

186
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
terms of content activity poison ID and

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,080
cvd polish should have in place an

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
authorization to access the computer

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,240
system so what is called proportionality

190
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,000
under which condition I allowed the

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,100
researcher to have access to the

192
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,019
computer system

193
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,540
um what kind of information is required

194
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,360
to report a vulnerability how we keep

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,260
confidential this process

196
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,240
what are the the deadline the procedure

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,000
deadline within 90 days this was the

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,399
time there was suggested how we keep in

199
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,000
place the right communication

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,100
channels among the different

201
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,420
stakeholders of this process

202
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,399
the potential reward security

203
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,300
researchers and then how we implement

204
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,620
the public disclosure

205
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,399
um also in terms of good practices we

206
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,260
find some interesting elements that were

207
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,080
mentioned during the the interview that

208
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,680
we have done with many member states the

209
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,839
reference to two standards isok IEC and

210
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,980
um AI SOC I see

211
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,380
2914741 and

212
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,839
301-1142

213
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,980
also in terms of approach bottom-up

214
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,079
approach like the Netherlands have done

215
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,420
in the world the Netherlands in theory

216
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,120
do not have a specific like the

217
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,079
government did is not giving specific

218
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,940
guideline want to do the disclosure but

219
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,279
they created from the bottom like an

220
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,540
ecosystem that allows the disclosure of

221
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,360
the vulnerability

222
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,060
the idea of talk to the vendors

223
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,380
familiarized with the ethical hacking

224
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,079
communities

225
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,720
implement the OCD recommended a good

226
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,940
practices

227
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,500
adopters to the common security advisor

228
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,279
framework this basically a warning

229
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,320
information

230
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,740
service system

231
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,700
would elements that were also raised

232
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,640
during this survey

233
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,920
where who should be involved in this

234
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,300
process and it's very clear from the you

235
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,760
know the this this chart here that the

236
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,640
majority of respondents say this should

237
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,360
be desert certainly play a major role in

238
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,940
this process and then the national cyber

239
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,720
security Authority instead less I'm

240
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,459
thinking it's a good idea to have a

241
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,980
direct intervention by the minister or

242
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,579
or from outside entities

243
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,719
the foreign entities for instance

244
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,600
um

245
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,540
then in terms of tools dedicate the

246
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,640
website

247
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,899
implementation technique systems

248
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,380
validation tools the other tools of this

249
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,380
kind very important the idea of creating

250
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,839
awareness racing campaign like

251
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,240
Lithuania cyber SEC breakfast or the

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,579
Netherlands like they are promoting

253
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,519
especially for young people

254
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,700
campaigns that they call Arc right okay

255
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,200
to make aware you know young people over

256
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
the potential the rule they should be

257
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,959
used you know in the contest and then on

258
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,200
the law you know to to report

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,600
vulnerabilities and the operational

260
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,220
class management activities

261
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,139
um we also looked at what are if this

262
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,680
situation these are the good practices

263
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,899
what are the challenges additions on on

264
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,220
current on CBD National policies and we

265
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,100
basically have asked you know uh to the

266
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,120
to the person that we have interviewed

267
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,240
to understand the can the following

268
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,300
challenges impede the established on CBD

269
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,180
policy in a country legal barriers

270
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,459
security researcher face significant

271
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,360
legal risk lack of cooperation among

272
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,260
stakeholders government ambiguity

273
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,500
concerning vulnerability exploitation

274
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,139
limited market incentive lack of

275
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,180
research and skill cost implementation

276
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,300
operation as you can see you know the

277
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,420
major major issues the legal barriers

278
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,399
and then the lack of cooperation amongst

279
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,920
the court this again brings back the

280
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,740
issue that you know that is extremely

281
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,639
important uh you know the process from

282
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,019
the discovery to the to the

283
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,260
disclosure of the vulnerability how we

284
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,060
manage this process so the need of

285
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,480
cooperation among stakeholders then we

286
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,880
Zoom the issue of the legal challenges

287
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,019
and we ask you know if like what was the

288
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,100
the major legal challenges criminal law

289
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,199
copyright law data Protection Law

290
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,100
contract law export control legislation

291
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,380
again it's very clear that you know that

292
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,760
the the most relevant

293
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
challenge is considered the the legal

294
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,279
the the critical the criminal law

295
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,040
basically you know that it's a it's a

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,279
blocking to some extent a smooth process

297
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,279
of vulnerabilities closure then the

298
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,320
the data Protection Law these are the

299
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,899
two major challenge okay now uh

300
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,720
we have also considered other challenges

301
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
like the economic challenge like the

302
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,180
vulnerability software market dynamics

303
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,339
what we mentioned before the lack of

304
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,220
operation amongst they told the limited

305
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,980
market incentive or security researcher

306
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,560
uh the fact the most security researcher

307
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,980
activist not professional employed by

308
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,920
private companies lack of research and

309
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,040
skill to implement CBD policy also the

310
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,320
cost of implementation operations CBD

311
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,279
policies

312
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,260
we consider also some political

313
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,060
challenge in other words what type of

314
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,820
model should be promoted top-down or

315
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,040
bottom-up approach in other words we

316
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,959
should start first the government the

317
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,779
private sector and so on what is the

318
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,360
role of the government the governed for

319
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,600
instance could update in perfect cyber

320
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,500
crime intellectual property framework

321
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,620
uh what is the auto support enabled CBD

322
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,980
policy but also some important leading

323
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,220
by example okay so the government can be

324
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,920
the first one to implement CBD policies

325
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,500
what about the role the private sector

326
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,639
should lead or should follow okay

327
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,760
um

328
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,500
just and then I will close

329
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,720
um looking at what's happening in Europe

330
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
we can say that it is also something

331
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,060
that we have already mentioned in our

332
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,600
first report as a steps in 2018 there

333
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,459
are two questions related to the link of

334
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,199
vulnerability discovered to criminal

335
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,259
offense the first one is under which

336
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,279
condition you know the

337
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,319
find vulnerabilities can be considered

338
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
like a under criminal law the second one

339
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
is under which condition should if this

340
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,179
crime crime should be prosecuted now

341
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,160
this interesting

342
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,699
um

343
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,280
the The Budapest competitions are very

344
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,559
important to mention the Budapest

345
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,919
convention say very clear that only the

346
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
unauthorized access should be considered

347
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
as criminal offense this means as long

348
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,260
as the company of the government put in

349
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,720
place a policy they say as long as you

350
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,660
follow some rules you are able to you

351
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,120
know to find vulnerabilities this is

352
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
extremely important especially the for

353
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,100
instance in some State like the Belgian

354
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,059
will make this example it's like if I I

355
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,900
buy the ticket to go on a bus when I if

356
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,940
I bought a ticket where I have the right

357
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,720
to to to go on the bus at the same time

358
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
in this case if I follow some rules I

359
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
can do I can look at the and search for

360
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,120
vulnerability under some specific

361
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
condition

362
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,840
um

363
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,760
overcome some legal challenges like from

364
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,679
the member state will be to amend the

365
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,280
criminal law amend the the directive the

366
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,940
EU level impede the you know the

367
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,919
application the discovery of

368
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,220
vulnerability but also some ideas like

369
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,520
the Protection security research by

370
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,039
recognizing the status of which blower

371
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,940
in the sense of directive 1937.

372
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,760
is some some member states are also

373
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,580
thinking about defining Balo to some

374
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,960
extent the role of ethical actors okay I

375
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,059
will stop here to just because I think I

376
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,700
give enough element of discussion thanks

377
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,660
thank you

378
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,660
they were at Suzuki Master this no

379
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,140
I would like to ask Mr itabashi to

380
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,940
explain the current status in Japan

381
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,760

389
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,640
um

390
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,860
the I would like to explain the

391
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,240
information security early warning

392
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,340
partnership conducted in Japan

393
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,720
today

394
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,580
I would

395
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,620
like to first of all talk about the

396
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,360
information security partnership I would

397
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,340
like explain what the partnership is and

398
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,960
secondly I would like to talk about the

399
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,660
current operation of the partnership and

400
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,480
then lastly as the third agenda item I

401
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,740
would like to talk about the challenges

402
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,160
that we are facing and the kind of

403
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,080
countermeasures that we have in mind to

404
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,100
overcome the challenges

405
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,620
first of all information security early

406
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,419
voting partnership let me briefly

407
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:28,860
explain what it is

408
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,160
this is based on the notice provided by

409
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,140
Ministry of economy trade and Industry

410
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,080
and the purpose is to secure the cyber

411
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,140
security is software related or

412
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,580
vulnerability related information

413
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,020
recommendations need to be put together

414
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,059
and so as to make sure that we can

415
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,220
ensure cyber security and prevent

416
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,860
damages across to the society or to the

417
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,720
citizens

418
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,960
and so that will be able

419
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,299
to

420
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,340
bring about vitality and sustainability

421
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,500
development of the economy and society

422
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,480
and the kojimbi to the realization of a

423
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,039
society in which citizens can live

424
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,340
safely and with peace of mind

425
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,039
the information security early warning

426
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,240
partnership IPA meti and JP soot and

427
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,299
also experts in Japan are cooperating

428
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,340
uh have cooperated to design the

429
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,500
partnership

430
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,220
and today uh Mr Takahashi is with us and

431
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,080
he has been involved from the designing

432
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,760
stage and he has provided a lot of

433
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,799
support in operating the system

434
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,840
and with regards to the system every

435
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,080
year as was explained earlier

436
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,760
including meti Security Experts

437
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,299
invited

438
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,280
and IPA has a committee and we invite

439
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,480
experts

440
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,179
to identify the challenges in operating

441
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,059
the system so that we can improve

442
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,500
the

443
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,419
the system that is how we are running

444
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,020
the partnership

445
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,720
and next I would like to

446
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,400
explain the guideline for the

447
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,200
implementation of other partnership let

448
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,880
me briefly explain what the guideline

449
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,020
says

450
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,539
So based on the notification provided by

451
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,580
meti we have

452
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,380
uh what we call the information security

453
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,360
early warning partnership guideline to

454
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,020
be implemented by the stakeholders

455
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,700
specifically

456
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,200
IPA

457
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,980
is the receiving uh entity and the JP

458
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,900
cert coordination Center is in charge of

459
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,220
coordinating

460
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,320
and in addition to that the discoverer

461
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,280
if we find the vulnerabilities and also

462
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,500
countermeasures identified by software

463
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,980
developers and also

464
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,720
as well as website operators all of

465
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,600
these stakeholders are corporate

466
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,820
collaborating to create countermeasures

467
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,080
for vulnerabilities

468
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,840
and the the partnership early morning

469
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,059
partnership let me explain the scope of

470
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,539
the application

471
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,100
this guideline covers vulnerability that

472
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,539
may affect the large number of people

473
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,820
specifically software products widely

474
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,340
used in Japan and web applications that

475
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,440
run on websites

476
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,100
so they are software products

477
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,280
basically within the scope and with

478
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,880
across the websites

479
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,039
websites that can be accessed from Japan

480
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,220
will be in the scope of application

481
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,100
this system covers a software products

482
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,780
and web applications

483
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,260
so there are two different reportings uh

484
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,159
uh accepted through the system

485
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,500
now uh

486
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,299
this is the third point about the system

487
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,400
as I have already explained these are

488
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,799
the relevant parties in addition to IPA

489
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,539
and JB third we have the discoverer

490
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,820
product developers website operators so

491
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,919
there are three stakeholders or relevant

492
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,380
parties involved in the system and to

493
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,240
them

494
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,520
uh there are benefits that have worked

495
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,440
about to the relevant parties which are

496
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,480
explained on the slide for the

497
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
discoverers find the vulnerability

498
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,679
through IPA

499
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,240
they will be able

500
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,679
to

501
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,179
provide or can prompt software

502
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,220
developers and website operators to take

503
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,380
actions against vulnerability through a

504
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,940
public entity and in the case of

505
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,380
software developer

506
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,980
the discoverer's name will be

507
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,960
published

508
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,400
so that so what is called JV and the

509
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,440
protocyte

510
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,200
when we disclose vulnerability

511
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,419
information discovers name will also be

512
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,919
disclosed

513
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,780
and in addition to that for product

514
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,159
Developers

515
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,919
as written here there are three benefits

516
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,500
that will be provided to them a website

517
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,080
operators the same thing we believe that

518
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,700
these benefits will be brought to the

519
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
website operators as well

520
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,600
so this is how we are running the

521
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,100
partnership system

522
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,980
and next I would like to explain the

523
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,220
structure of the operation

524
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,520
as I said on the far left

525
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,740
of the diagram we have the discoverer

526
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,779
who find that it vulnerabilities and

527
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,799
there will be

528
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,720
providing reports on the vulnerability

529
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,760
that they found they will provide a

530
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
report to IPA who is

531
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,919
receiving entity at the top it talks

532
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,279
about the software product

533
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,640
and in that case in the case of software

534
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,320
IPA will be reported by the discoverer

535
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
and IPA will provide a report or provide

536
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,120
notification to JP cert CC and jp.cc I

537
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,380
will

538
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,799
uh often uh identify the software

539
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,020
developer and JB said

540
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,120
will contact the software developer

541
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,220
and the

542
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,500
once the product vulnerability is

543
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,460
corrected as written at the top IPA JP

544
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,559
set where it says vulnerability

545
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,919
information prototype vulnerability

546
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,900
related information will be posted on

547
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,700
the photo site and when that is posted

548
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,860
the discoverer's name will also be

549
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,279
published

550
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,200
and now for the website vulnerability

551
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
for app web applications likewise

552
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Discoverer will provide a report to IPA

553
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,700
and in this case IPA will go directly to

554
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,640
the website operator IP will I will

555
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,500
identify the contact information of the

556
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,779
website operator and they will directly

557
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,880
contact the operator so the website

558
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,640
operator will be able to take actions

559
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,760
and this is the operational structure of

560
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
the early warning partnership

561
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,760
no

562
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,000
so let me explain the operational status

563
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,940
of early warning partnership

564
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,820
this system I don't know if I talked

565
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,340
about this but it started in 2004 in

566
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,260
July

567
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,260
and up until today it's been in

568
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,320
operation for about 18 years every year

569
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,480
we uh

570
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,900
reporting number of reports which is

571
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,779
shown in the bar chart blue represents

572
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,120
software products and colored in yet and

573
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,480
pink website related reports

574
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,580
and the graph

575
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,840
uh shows up until the end of 2021 and

576
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,580
the total number of reports received is

577
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,539
a 17 139

578
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,279
no

579
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,200
uh I would like to explain the most

580
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,820
recent three years for the past three

581
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,760
years uh the number of reports are shown

582
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,039
in this graph

583
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,059
the graph above and shows

584
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,900
they quoted a number of reports

585
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,059
in the in 2022 for the second quarter

586
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,559
uh April through June the number of

587
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,360
reports received

588
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,080
was a 75 for software products and 88

589
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,158
for websites

590
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,720
and on the right hand side we have a

591
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,159
table

592
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,279
which shows the number of vulnerability

593
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,200
reports received in the second quarter

594
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,820
of 2022 shows the numbers on the

595
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,179
bar chart or software 75 and it shows

596
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,179
the cumulative total is

597
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,520
557 for website a cumulative number is

598
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,460
12 308 cumulative total is 17 465 cases

599
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,220
and the graph at the bottom shows

600
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,960
a vulnerability countermeasure

601
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,640
information release for software

602
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,140
products

603
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,580
so with the the number of vulnerability

604
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,520
countermeasures disclosed is shown in

605
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,620
green chart for the second quarter of

606
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,799
2022 24

607
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,700
um we releases have been made

608
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,399
and now

609
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,260
uh talking about the operational status

610
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,640
once again uh as of June 2022

611
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,480
both for software products and websites

612
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,020
uh it shows um the operational status

613
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,520
for both

614
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,980
and as you can see at the bot at the top

615
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,600
we have the software products the total

616
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,940
number is

617
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,380
557 reports

618
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,240
and uh

619
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,940
they publicized

620
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,279
uh

621
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,799
2417 uh where the countermeasures are

622
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,799
published and written in yellow there

623
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,899
are some that are still being under a

624
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:13,260
process 2087 so out of the total number

625
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,659
of reports about 40 percent

626
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,380
to 48 are now being handled or in

627
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,640
process

628
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,039
and the graph at the bottom shows the

629
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,679
status of the website related reports

630
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,080
for websites it says fixed

631
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,960
8290 items have already been fixed and

632
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,940
the total is twelve thousand three

633
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,380
hundred eight

634
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,440
so therefore 86 percent of total have

635
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,460
already been fixed

636
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,880
and next slide it shows uh it's not

637
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,980
really operational status but bro the

638
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,260
reporting status

639
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,140
so the number of software dated

640
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,360
vulnerability

641
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,760
it shows the type of products are shown

642
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,159
in the pie chart

643
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,740
so if you can take a look at that web

644
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,500
application routers

645
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,620
account for about 50 of the total number

646
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,360
of reports

647
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,779
and as we see uh expansion in the use of

648
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,640
smartphone there is an increase in

649
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,020
smartphone application related

650
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,240
vulnerabilities reported

651
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,820
and the pie chart at the bottom shows

652
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,260
some

653
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,299
the impact

654
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,940
of vulnerabilities reported

655
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:38,820
so for example execution or arbitrarily

656
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,039
scripts execution of a bitter the

657
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,620
comments those account for about 50

658
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,700
percent

659
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,140
of the total number of reports

660
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,840
our next slide is about the website

661
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,500
the pie chart at the top shows types of

662
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,780
vulnerabilities

663
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,179
[Music]

664
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,039
cross-site scripting

665
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,779
account for about 58 of total so 60 of

666
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,360
the total is related to cross-site

667
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,059
scripting and it says uh incomplete

668
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,000
configuration of DNS SQL injection if

669
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,919
you add those 80 of the reports

670
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,779
related to those three items and at the

671
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:30,059
bottom we have a 45 impact and uh

672
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:34,799
and we have over 50 or 50 50 to 57 of

673
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,720
display of false information on the

674
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,740
genuine website

675
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,059
foreign

676
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,440
that is all for the operational status

677
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,740
and lastly I would like to talk about

678
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,460
the operational challenges that we face

679
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,279
as we operate this early warning

680
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,820
partnership

681
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,940
first of all a challenge is related to

682
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,039
software products there are three things

683
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,880
first is it takes time for developers to

684
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,880
respond to vulnerability reports

685
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,880
of course once software products when

686
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,380
they are reported there are different

687
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,380
types of software products including

688
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,899
smartphones and they also reports

689
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,659
related to the Control software

690
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,600
so even if we make contacts to the

691
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,559
developers about the vulnerabilities

692
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,659
developers take times it takes time for

693
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,120
them to take necessary actions and the

694
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,000
Second Challenge is uh

695
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,100
losing contact with the developer in the

696
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,840
middle of coordination sometimes to get

697
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,320
the con we lose contact with them

698
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,620
so this is quite similar but there is a

699
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,419
wide range of software products where

700
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,559
for which we receive reports and also uh

701
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,779
individuals

702
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,940
uh there are cases that the individuals

703
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,620
make reports

704
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,880
so even if the discoverer make reports

705
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,539
in the administ of uh coordination we

706
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,080
sometimes is contact with the Developers

707
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,679
on Thursday

708
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,820
um I believe this is not an issue

709
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,780
limited to Japan but people have

710
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,520
negative impacts so product developers

711
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,199
have negative attitudes towards the

712
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,460
publication of vulnerability

713
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,480
countermeasure information

714
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:30,119
so um publishing vulnerability counter

715
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,300
major information means that it shows

716
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,000
that uh products software products have

717
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,820
many vulnerabilities which may equal to

718
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,339
software products having poor quality

719
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,399
so

720
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,199
so the developers

721
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,260
do not want to be proactively publishing

722
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,379
vulnerability related information

723
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,839
so we

724
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,900
haven't been able to erase the awareness

725
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
of the developers that it is a good

726
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,460
thing to disclose vulnerability related

727
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,960
information

728
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,980
and next is a related website challenges

729
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,420
related to the operation of the system

730
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,339
there are two items

731
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,040
first is uh

732
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
it takes time to contact with website

733
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,520
operators

734
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:27,599
so we will see reports on the

735
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,599
vulnerability also of the websites and

736
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,800
when we do we receive information like

737
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,440
URLs but IPA would view the pages to

738
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,020
identify the contact information

739
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,940
but

740
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,300
we uh often it is often not possible to

741
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,280
identify the security related contact

742
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,720
person

743
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,640
and IPA would try its best to find the

744
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
contact information but it's not easy

745
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,660
which means that we are not able to

746
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,780
notify the website operator of their

747
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,300
vulnerability on their website so it

748
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,099
takes time to contact them

749
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,900
that's the first Challenge and the

750
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,240
Second Challenge is very much like the

751
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,099
software related challenge it takes time

752
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:17,339
for them to take actions

753
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,960
so uh

754
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,480
they are large corporations and

755
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
individuals that are operating these

756
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,619
websites

757
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,900
and we are receiving reports for

758
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,880
different types of websites

759
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,339
and we would we would provide

760
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,560
information about the vulnerability to

761
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,440
the website The Operators but

762
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,079
they may not have the skill or to take

763
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,200
actions or they don't have the resources

764
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,480
to implement countermeasures against the

765
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,020
vulnerability reported

766
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,020
so about the challenges uh what are the

767
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,060
things that the IPA is thinking about to

768
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,339
overcome those challenges

769
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,560
about software products there are two

770
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,099
things that we are thinking about first

771
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,079
is to recognize product developers who

772
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,060
are proactive in taking vulnerability of

773
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,740
counter measures

774
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,500
that is what we are thinking about

775
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,180
for example

776
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,240
reported vulnerability if the software

777
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,820
developers are proactive in taking

778
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,280
actions and proactive in disclosing that

779
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,420
information

780
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,420
uh probably provide some kind of

781
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,280
recognition

782
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,040
for their attitude which is something

783
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,500
that is now understudied and the second

784
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,320
is um

785
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,119
spreading the word about the need for

786
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,859
vulnerability countermeasures to product

787
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,900
developers even if we provide

788
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,359
information about the vulnerability

789
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,000
many of the product developers do not

790
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,460
have a good understanding on the need to

791
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,380
take actions

792
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,420
which is something that we need to work

793
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,280
on so IPA and related organizations

794
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,040
uh using different channels

795
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,079
to provide

796
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,380
education to software developers this is

797
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,579
an ongoing

798
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,579
process and we would like to continue

799
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,880
with this

800
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,320
and about the reporting related to

801
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,839
websites

802
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,940
so there are two things that we are

803
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,740
thinking of implementing the first one

804
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,540
is

805
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,640
I talked about this earlier as a

806
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,320
challenge it's not easy to find the

807
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,079
contact information or for of a website

808
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,800
operators so at IPA

809
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,599
we were saying that if you had to

810
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,099
operate a website is

811
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,839
since there is a possibility that

812
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,700
security related vulnerability may be

813
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,920
reported to us please make sure that the

814
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,660
contact information is available on the

815
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,220
website that kind of guideline is

816
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,079
provided so we would like to utilize

817
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,300
that guideline to raise the awareness

818
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,260
and the second is um

819
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,420
vulnerability countermeasure I think

820
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,980
there is a need to educate the website

821
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,839
over it as the need to implement the

822
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,880
countermeasures

823
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,460
so we would like to

824
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,040
create it we do have educational

825
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,720
materials already so we would like to

826
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,300
continue to

827
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,339
with our educational campaign to raise

828
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,680
the awareness

829
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,560
and including these actions we would

830
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,460
like to continue to try to overcome the

831
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,500
challenges that I shared

832
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,220
lastly

833
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,440
I talked about um

834
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,599
the reporting system or information

835
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,400
security early wounding partnership

836
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,800
system was explained

837
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,560
and in the future

838
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,020
I hope I'm hoping that you will be able

839
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,640
to have a good understanding on the

840
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,400
system and be able to improve the system

841
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,920
for the future thank you very much for

842
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,540
your uh

843
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,140
attention

844
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:05,099
thank you very much we would like to now

845
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,420
like to ask Mr Alan Friedman to explain

846
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,300
about the current status in the U.S

847
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,960
thank you very much akua son

848
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,940
to make sure we have time for discussion

849
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,359
I will try to be quickly and so I

850
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,380
apologize to the translators uh

851
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,680
so my name is Alan Friedman I am known

852
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,560
as the guy who does not shut up about

853
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,880
s-bomb

854
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,599
uh but today I will talk about uh the

855
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,460
U.S policy on the cvd uh in 2015

856
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,060
I ran the first U.S government public

857
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,099
effort on disclosure where we said hey

858
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,040
we have been fighting over this since

859
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
the 1990s

860
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,660
let's put hackers

861
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,780
and companies in the same room

862
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,359
and talk about obstacles for

863
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,800
collaboration

864
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,420
and the good news is that 2022

865
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,960
is different from 2015.

866
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,200
2015 there was still a lot of fighting

867
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,180
whereas today I would argue

868
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,880
cvd in many parts of the world including

869
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,339
Japan is not a dangerous topic we can

870
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,260
talk about it and we have made a lot of

871
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,460
progress so very briefly the U.S policy

872
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,200
has embraced CBD uh as have many

873
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,280
governments uh and now our focus is on

874
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,760
lowering barriers to moving good

875
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,339
vulnerability information around

876
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,020
the laws

877
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,180
have not changed but they are being

878
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,740
interpreted

879
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,200
better

880
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,960
uh and we now spend our time focusing on

881
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,260
how to work help the private sector work

882
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,880
with researchers

883
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,359
uh so there are a couple of laws the

884
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,280
first one is Criminal

885
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,720
the second one is civil uh and the good

886
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,740
news

887
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,040
is that we are doing a lot better on

888
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,680
interpreting these laws

889
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,780
uh the Department of Justice this year

890
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,119
issued a clarification

891
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,839
uh where the main Department directs all

892
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,740
federal prosecutors to say if you see a

893
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,820
disclosure

894
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,640
and it is good faith

895
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,820
do not prosecute

896
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,240
uh and similarly

897
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,400
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has

898
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,760
more and more exceptions especially for

899
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,320
civil work

900
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,140
so happy to talk more about the legal

901
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,240
side if you want to know more but the

902
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,560
other thing that I want to talk about

903
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,420
today is how the vulnerability ecosystem

904
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,720
is making it easier to report and fix

905
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,200
vulnerabilities uh so I won't go through

906
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,079
all these slides but first

907
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,960
who knows the cve program

908
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,579
everyone should know the sea who has a

909
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,680
cve

910
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,500
anyone found their own bug have a number

911
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,260
there we go couple

912
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,319
uh so a cve is the trade for

913
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,079
vulnerabilities uh for products

914
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,359
and the goal is to say let's enable more

915
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,160
people to assign cves and so this is uh

916
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,220
the the model here is when a cve

917
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,260
numbering Authority

918
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,599
becomes aware of a vulnerability

919
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,880
then they coordinate

920
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,760
and then we assign the ID they can leave

921
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,980
the assignment so it does not have to go

922
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,060
through the centralization

923
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,359
anyone can become a cve CNA in different

924
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,800
categories most of them are vendors or

925
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,920
open source projects but bug Bounty

926
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,680
programs and researchers hackers can

927
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,640
become their own CNA and so if anyone is

928
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,880
interested my plea is let me talk to you

929
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,359
afterwards and we can get you started on

930
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,000
the process this is a global effort

931
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,720
there are currently I believe nine CNAs

932
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,280
in Japan

933
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,640
uh including many of our sponsors thank

934
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,500
you

935
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,800
uh and also JP cert plays a very good

936
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,500
role and I want to thank them and their

937
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,880
government sponsors

938
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
uh

939
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,740
so the path to becoming a CNA

940
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,339
very briefly is you reach out to the cve

941
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:03,119
program or you can come talk to sisa or

942
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,420
you can talk to JP cert

943
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,579
uh you register

944
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,180
we look at the requirements and there is

945
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,220
onboarding there's training so you don't

946
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,319
have to do it all yourself

947
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,680
and then uh you can join so this is a

948
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,720
very important part of the collaboration

949
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,540
moving forward uh because we want to

950
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,079
make it easy for researchers to work

951
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,520
with uh the people who make and maintain

952
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,060
the software uh and the CNA program is

953
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,799
critical for that collaboration

954
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,300
so I don't need to go through this so I

955
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,880
will Instead try to welcome the panel up

956
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,099
because uh we have just a few minutes to

957
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,200
talk about how to compare these efforts

958
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,480
so thank you and if you would like to

959
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,160
know more come talk to me today

960
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,140
thank you Ellen so like to welcome the

961
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,359
panelists come up on the stage and take

962
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,720
a seat

963
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,660
so we don't have much time left but let

964
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,040
us start the discussion

965
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,359
so first

966
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,339
Anisa

967
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:38,099
Lauren sassan talked about the legal

968
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,160
challenges and the economic challenges

969
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,240
and the political challenges

970
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,119
foreign for the legal challenge Japan

971
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,500
is also working hard

972
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,740
so I want to touch on what Japan is

973
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,280
doing so the first introduction

974
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,099
in October 2017

975
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:07,800
security service providers

976
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,800
P2P

977
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,280
the researcher researching P2P was

978
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,440
arrested

979
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,540
security service provider was arrested

980
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,760
and he was subsequently not prosecuted

981
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,680
but he was arrested and this was an

982
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,000
impactful incident so

983
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,819
the law enforcement level

984
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,599
need to understand the important role

985
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,180
played by the security service provider

986
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,880
cyber Security Experts so that's what I

987
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,460
think as a legal expert

988
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,000
so this early warning Partnerships

989
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,839
the legal efforts made in early warning

990
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,119
Partnerships the guideline has a very

991
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,560
detailed

992
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,500
guideline

993
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,480
explanation from legal perspective

994
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,220
and furthermore

995
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,700
the detailed legal points

996
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,599
at the starting point of 2004 I had I

997
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,619
wrote an instruction and so this is also

998
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,780
made public and was revised three years

999
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,160
ago

1000
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,339
and reverse engineering

1001
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,079
didn't feel

1002
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,980
happy is

1003
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,940
May infringe the copyright law in

1004
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,359
discovering the vulnerability and so

1005
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,060
it took 10 years to revise the original

1006
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,400
law but this copyright law was also

1007
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,839
revised

1008
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,180
reverse engineering for the purpose of

1009
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,619
security

1010
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,079
is

1011
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,460
from the fair use principle in Japan

1012
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,420
it is now become legal in Japan

1013
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,859
foreign

1014
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,240
and cyber crime

1015
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,640
the law enforcement Authority need to

1016
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,859
take solid action and this awareness is

1017
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:10,500
rising for example IPA

1018
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,079
has people over here

1019
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,700
and

1020
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,380
in April cyber police

1021
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,359
agency there was a reorganization so we

1022
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,460
are hoping that we can improve our level

1023
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,980
increase our level

1024
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,319
so these are the practical matters in

1025
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,500
Japan

1026
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,880
so how can the developer side

1027
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,740
for the developer side's report

1028
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,240
for the developers vulnerability report

1029
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,460
and disclosure how can we fairly

1030
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,099
evaluate and assess it and take

1031
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:54,619
appropriate action and take it seriously

1032
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,720
in order to secure this proper process

1033
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,900
how can we ensure the sincere honest

1034
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,260
attitude of the developers so I want to

1035
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,140
ask from us and Europe so lorenza-san

1036
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,940
uh do you have any examples like you

1037
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,400
design incentives or any example you can

1038
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,819
share with us

1039
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,760
well I can't say that in um in the EU

1040
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,560
um you know our research also uh what

1041
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,359
the

1042
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:37,500
um

1043
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,400
you know the the European uh their

1044
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,280
commission is planning for

1045
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,300
it's basically say that if

1046
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,900
the

1047
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,400
you know you you follow the

1048
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,160
proportionality criteria The Budapest

1049
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,839
conventures in allow you to to implement

1050
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:05,760
this CBD polish so private sector you

1051
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,819
know can do that they don't need you

1052
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,160
know like

1053
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,680
example from the government but they can

1054
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,280
just put on their own website this CBD

1055
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,920
policy so I would say that they don't

1056
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,319
need a specific incentive to do that

1057
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,319
foreign

1058
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,280
as well uh same question to you anything

1059
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,700
that's been considered in the U.S

1060
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,599
um I think it is useful uh to draw a

1061
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,720
distinction between

1062
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,319
inactivity from ignorance versus the

1063
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,819
people who know better

1064
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:51,119
the first time a researcher knocks on

1065
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,700
your door it can be scary

1066
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,780
and so the role of both government and

1067
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,740
the security World should be to help

1068
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
that first time goes smoothly

1069
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,020
and it's also important for the

1070
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,440
researcher to understand okay this is a

1071
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,760
new organization

1072
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,440
uh that is a different problem from

1073
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,559
uh the software supplier that just does

1074
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,780
not want to take action and that's where

1075
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,440
we need both incentives and continuing

1076
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,200
the occasional habit of saying if

1077
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,780
there's no response then other people

1078
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,180
need to step in and the last thing I'll

1079
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,000
say where we have helped with tools is

1080
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,260
multi-party disclosure

1081
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:45,140
what happens with something like log4j

1082
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,819
and there's going to be a vulnerability

1083
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,819
that is announced in the next week which

1084
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,940
affects lots of vendors and for that we

1085
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,940
need very good coordination between the

1086
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,960
vendor Community there is a new tool

1087
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,059
called Vince which allows automated and

1088
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,700
secure coordination that the US

1089
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,520
government has been using in the CNA

1090
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,880
process

1091
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,559
so this early warning partnership

1092
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,280
when this was first established

1093
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:33,000
what situation led to this establishment

1094
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,880
so the history that led to the

1095
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,680
establishment of this system the

1096
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,900
structure is

1097
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,540
the person who detected the

1098
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,280
vulnerability

1099
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,119
uh contacted the software company then

1100
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,220
the response was is this person a hacker

1101
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,760
so the counterpart couldn't did not deal

1102
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,099
with the person or listen attentively

1103
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,040
and therefore to avoid or solve this

1104
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,240
problem government agency the public

1105
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,680
agency became an intermediator to

1106
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,700
distribute and enhance the

1107
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,960
countermeasure of vulnerability

1108
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,960
disclosure and that is why we

1109
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,900
established this framework

1110
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,119
so

1111
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,240
this system

1112
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,020
[Music]

1113
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,140
is welcomed by the related community so

1114
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,800
pisert

1115
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,240
companies that introduce Pizza is

1116
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,160
increasing now is that right

1117
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,940
yes exactly

1118
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:46,440
IPA without the involvement of the IPA

1119
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,760
the discoverer the interaction there are

1120
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,380
some more and more vendors that have

1121
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,300
direct interaction with the discoverer

1122
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,079
of the the vulnerability NP search

1123
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,880
is now established more among the

1124
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,220
vendors

1125
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,118
the

1126
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:10,740
one so considering the current situation

1127
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,579
the government's website or the software

1128
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:17,339
used by got the government

1129
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,619
a full vulnerability related to those

1130
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,960
websites and software

1131
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,240
take actions against them and make

1132
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,720
secure the websites uh run by the

1133
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,859
government

1134
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,720
so anansan

1135
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,359
can you explain the efforts made by the

1136
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,700
US government

1137
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,359
so we know that writing secure software

1138
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,040
is hard

1139
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,460
the government cannot do it better than

1140
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,660
the private sector in fact often

1141
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,960
government-written software is worse

1142
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,119
and so there has been an effort in the

1143
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,280
U.S government

1144
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,819
and in fact a requirement that every U.S

1145
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:03,359
government agency must have a disclosure

1146
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:07,140
policy so that when someone discovers a

1147
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,920
flaw in the tax website or the labor

1148
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,260
website

1149
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,880
they can be notified

1150
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,319
uh and there are now bug Bounties in the

1151
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,960
U.S government uh this is not new going

1152
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,380
back four or five years even a program

1153
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,880
called hack the Pentagon

1154
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,920
uh which is you know the very serious

1155
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,920
National Security website uh so we have

1156
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,540
been working on uh living our policy

1157
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,900
advice

1158
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,380
what are the efforts made by made in the

1159
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,660
U.S how are they how how easy are you

1160
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,540
securing the security of the government

1161
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,460
websites

1162
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,319
well

1163
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,319
our research showed that the government

1164
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:06,020
should lead by example and

1165
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,140
the European commission is giving

1166
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,280
guideline you know to the member state

1167
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,480
to implement CBD policies this is the

1168
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,359
case of the net infrastructure security

1169
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,980
revision

1170
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,599
that require the rich member State

1171
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,079
Should develop a national vulnerability

1172
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,240
process policy

1173
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,920
and also the more recent proposal of the

1174
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,180
Cyber resilience act that covers the

1175
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,160
products or complement to some extent

1176
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,140
they needs to and as a very

1177
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,180
strict required to you know for the

1178
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,839
products in terms of how to operate

1179
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,599
vulnerability uh this close

1180
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,059
if I ask you about the status of

1181
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:11,579
Japanese government uh it will be

1182
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,700
difficult situation so I will avoid that

1183
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,079
question

1184
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,460
but

1185
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,859
given the Japanese framework digital

1186
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:23,040
agency was established last year

1187
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,319
this digital agency

1188
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,480
is very active

1189
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,180
need to play a very active role in this

1190
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,779
Arena right

1191
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,220
yes

1192
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,920
