1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
Thank you.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,180


3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,300


4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,620


5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,360


6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,679


7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839


8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,820


9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,859
I'm sorry, but when this talk is over, I

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,760
will upload this presentation CD, so

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,039
if there are parts that were too early

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,300


13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,640
, I hope you can read it slowly later. If

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,260


15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,700
you search for the keyword "getub Yamamoto Security Presentations"

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,180
, I think it will come up

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,100
later.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,020


19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,520
I think I'll share the link on this Daiwa Security Twitter account So what is the flow of this talk

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,719


21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,579


22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,579


23
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,800


24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,820


25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,780


26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,020
?  For those of you who want to contribute to something,

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,239


28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,819
I would like to provide some reference information Let's introduce myself. My name

29
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,020


30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,140
is Zaku.

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,659


32
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,400


33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,580


34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,900


35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,320
Since then,

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000


37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680


38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,640


39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,020
I've been in the Kansai area, and I've been holding regular study sessions since I'm a manager of the Kansai community at

40
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,680


41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,420


42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,780


43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,920
Bodentia.

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,939
First of all, before we talk

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,200
about the importance of event log analysis. First of all, it is included in all

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,100
terminals and

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,960
Windows terminals, so

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,720
it will be the basis of Windows fringe investigations

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,700
.

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,360


51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860


52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,299
EDR, which costs a good price, leaves

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,500
detailed

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,560
evidence.

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,639


56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,120


57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,940


58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,260


59
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,280


60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,560


61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,760


62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,080
Now

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,340
, let's talk about the Nog setting problem.

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,720
Windows'

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,940
default tool settings aren't good at all

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,500
.

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,640


68
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,780
About 80% of the tools you want aren't recorded

69
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,180
in the default setting,

70
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,760
so as far as I can see, among the tools that are recorded.

71
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,940
Approximately 70% or more is already noise  It's not

72
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,280
very useful for Feldench investigations or incident response.Also,

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000


74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440


75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,519


76
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,900
the log size of Difford on Windows

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,739
is

78
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,860
small and

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,319
only 1MB or 20MB is

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,459
left at most, so if it's

81
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,260
a domain controller or a server, the

82
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,099


83
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,340
tools will fill up quickly, and it's important evidence.  It will be

84
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,980
overwritten

85
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,040
Again, the video is failing.

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,360
Execution and

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,500
prostik's

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,739
very important tools do not remain by default,

89
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,659
so

90
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,720


91
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,700


92
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,360
it is necessary to improve animal settings using GP and intune startup tickets.

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
The ideal

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200


95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,959
thing would be to introduce Microsoft's question.

96
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,280
I'll

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,599
talk more about sigma later,

98
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,180
but there's this

99
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,780
open source

100
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,379


101
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,099
attack detection rule called sigma, and

102
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,159
I'm going to look a little bit at what Windows DOG that rule is

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
looking at.  I made a

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,640
simple analysis like this, and only

105
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,900


106
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,799


107
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,860
10 to 20% of the reform rules use

108
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,700


109
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,079


110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,040


111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,959
the default tools.  If you

112
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,419
enable it with weak,

113
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,040


114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,699
you can use about 75% of the new model, but

115
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,100
if you want to use the 100% rule, you

116
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,060
need to introduce a question

117
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,800


118
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,639


119
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,100


120
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,479
.

121
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,960
In the first place

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,540
, it is necessary to ask questions such as whether tools are not read as read by default,

123
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,060


124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,160
so I made a video about improving

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
agricultural settings

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240


127
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,040


128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,199
.

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,020


130
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,040


131
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,380


132
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,020
Today

133
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,259
I made the ultimate guide for Windows event log settings for

134
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,120
dfir and teacher hunting.It's been

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,539
published since the week before last.There were quite a few responses from people overseas

136
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,360


137
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,320


138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
.

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,280


140
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,699


141
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,280


142
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,520
This is part of the document.

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,840


144
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,560


145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560


146
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,240


147
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,639
Enable this category after default settings or recommended

148
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,320
settings  When

149
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,099
enabled, it stops what kind of attacks can be detected.Also,

150
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,479


151
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,900
if you enable it, which event is

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,860
good, but

153
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,979
it will be effective.I'm resting up like this

154
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,940
,

155
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,620


156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,820
so when I study Windows event videos,

157
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,500
I also

158
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,380
tune the agricultural settings.

159
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,740
I think it will be very helpful when you do

160
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,120


161
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,259
event tag

162
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,400
analysis

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
problems and

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
solutions

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,979
.

166
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,259


167
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,440


168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560


169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
In

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,060
fact, there are more than 300

171
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,020
different tools scattered around, so

172
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,160
it

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,220
was really hard to check the square tools

174
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,400


175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
manually

176
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,819


177
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,360


178
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,520
.  Also

179
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,600
, even in a small-scale network, for

180
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,280
example

181
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,780
, even if the data is less than 1 gigabyte, the

182
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,340
number of events is

183
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,759
over 100,000

184
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,940
.

185
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,220


186
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,699


187
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,720


188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,500


189
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,639


190
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,080


191
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,300
I think Frenzik has been around for quite a few years now, but

192
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,280
mainly this information gathering method,

193
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,419
for example

194
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,340


195
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,979


196
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,860
, copying only the necessary data instead of copying the entire hard disk of a

197
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,180
Windows terminal,

198
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,720
has become mainstream.  But from now on, I think we have to create a tool for this passive screw company

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
, not only as an information gathering tool, but also as an

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,780
analysis

201
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,759
tool.

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199


203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319


204
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,539


205
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:04,680


206
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,039


207
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,380
It's usually done within half a day or a day,

208
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,400
and the

209
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,720
attackers are incredibly fast, so the

210
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
blue team will

211
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,800
quickly detect it and respond immediately,

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,520
and lose trust in the response

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400


214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
.

215
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,458
It's a tool called Ueda, Hayabusa, and Takagi

216
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,779
.

217
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,860
First, a tool called weather.

218
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,940
Me,

219
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,099
Derailment Dark, and others

220
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,099


221
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,620
.

222
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,640


223
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,220


224
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,060


225
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,180
I think it can be fixed. Various functions

226
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,480
are included, but the best  What

227
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,940
I think is a good function is the function to create this movie

228
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,500
inside the

229
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,180


230
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,080
body.As I will explain later, you can also analyze the use of ntim,

231
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,360
etc.

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,060
So, when I thought about creating the time of this movie

233
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,140


234
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,959
It

235
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,100
is necessary to extract information from tools, and it

236
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,500
is quite difficult to do it manually, so

237
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,680
I have automated all of the extraction and analysis

238
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,120
.

239
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,540


240
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,820


241
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,440


242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,680
And since a lot of videos are turned

243
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
off, there is a

244
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,959
lot of noise, so this

245
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,140
technique tool ignores all that noise

246
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,440


247
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,700


248
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,580
.  However,

249
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,100
since it's a very theme price, it's also done automatically.

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,560


251
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,080


252
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,140


253
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,600


254
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,880


255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,019


256
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,399


257
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,320
It took a theme, but

258
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,000
if you use this middle path,

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,459
you don't have to say anything about

260
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,420


261
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,399


262
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360


263
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,339
that

264
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,160
kind of theme.  The GY comes out, and the

265
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,779
paper time,

266
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,519
labor type,

267
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,040
authentication entity Adam, Carlos authentication,

268
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
source IPS timers, etc.

269
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,519


270
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,040
come out.

271
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120


272
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Lateral deployment Which terminal deployed

273
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,839


274
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,779
next to where? Passion

275
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,060
attacks, etc.

276
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,320
Just by looking at this, many

277
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,399


278
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
attacks are very

279
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,120
conspicuous, so

280
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,000
I think you can easily distinguish them.

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,279
This is a video type

282
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,300
aggregation

283
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,860
function.

284
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,260


285
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,480
Recently

286
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,920


287
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,339
, I think ntl has become as dangerous a protocol as smb version 1, so I think you should

288
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,180


289
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,959
definitely

290
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,040
turn it away.

291
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,820


292
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,320


293
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360


294
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,620


295
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,220
Since I won't be able to use ntim in my old age, I'll first enable the

296
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,180
tools

297
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,820


298
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,920


299
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
of ntim.It would be nice to take a picture of that tool for about two weeks or a month and analyze it.

300
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,019


301
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:01,980


302
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,760
Even if

303
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,720
I contact you, please disable it, and if it doesn't work, please

304
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,940
re-

305
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
enable

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
it.

307
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440


308
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,820


309
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,720


310
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,779


311
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,120


312
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,860


313
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,079


314
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,140
Hayabusa This is the strong sword I'm most proud of

315
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,480
. It

316
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,579
was released last

317
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,260


318
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,459


319
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:51,300
Christmas.  I'm just

320
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,579
designing tools

321
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,339
and gathering people who are much smarter than me.The

322
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,200
actual development is all

323
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,760
done by the amazing programmers on this side

324
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,220


325
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,440


326
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,399


327
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,320
.

328
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,260
It's written in , so

329
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,040


330
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,740
it

331
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,120
's possible to create a memory-safe, C-like buffaloes very quickly,

332
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,639
but I don't

333
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,360


334
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440


335
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,120
think it's possible.

336
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120


337
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,060
You can also improve the binary for the OS. Also,

338
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,800
since it's a stand zone

339
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,700


340
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,959


341
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,360
, there's no need to install Dot Dead, Python, or anything like Party Lifeline. All the

342
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,200
rules are based

343
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,980


344
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,519
on Sigma's

345
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,380
scenery, which I'll explain later, so

346
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,600
anyone can easily

347
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
make room for it.

348
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,339
It can be expanded.

349
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,779
This hiyabusa appears over

350
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,899
300 Windows

351
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,519


352
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,120
event tools and extracts important logs and

353
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,459
traces of attacks.It saves

354
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,699


355
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,700
important information to the

356
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,959
timeline in CSV or JSON format.

357
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,018


358
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,180
If you import the CSV into,

359
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,220
for example, exced or

360
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,440
Nexpolar Anastack Stack

361
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,060
Spank within Time,

362
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,579
you

363
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,740
can analyze it there.The

364
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,180
JSON format

365
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,040
can be analyzed with the JQ command.

366
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,120
This

367
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,160
data reduction is the most unnecessary

368
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,540
event tool.

369
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,180
Not only does it ignore the event, but it

370
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,220
also accepts the data that it extracts

371
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,139
.

372
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,399


373
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,040


374
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,600


375
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,260


376
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,800


377
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,300
More than twice as much

378
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,740
data is destroyed each time, but

379
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,620
it's already

380
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,839


381
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,380
necessary to explain the event so much.  If you only want the Menema information

382
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,940
like this on the right side,

383
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,079


384
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
you can do it with 69 times more

385
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,019


386
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,380


387
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,339


388
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,540


389
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,279
.  Also,

390
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm doing my best to make this very long

391
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,079
Microsoft

392
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,579
Windows Windows file somehow a

393
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,459
long channel name, and I'm simply

394
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,240


395
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,399
accepting it as a

396
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,899


397
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,279
file

398
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,839
.

399
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,320
When you look at the timeline, you can fit everything on

400
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,000
that one

401
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,660


402
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,740
screen

403
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,519


404
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,760
. If you don't do this, the analyst has

405
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,540


406
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,519
to scroll from left to right every time

407
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,779


408
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,240
, check the feed information, return to the left, and

409
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,120


410
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,220
scroll left and right for a long time.  It's not good, so it's

411
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,980
going to be very slow,

412
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,940


413
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,339


414
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,199
and I think everyone gets irritated quickly and

415
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,660


416
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,940
gets a lot of stress

417
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,500
. I'm already trying to make Windows video analysis

418
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,920


419
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,839


420
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:49,380


421
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,600
fun.  Combined with over 3,000 posts and discontinued departments, it's

422
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,699


423
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,620


424
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,720
updated every day

425
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,620
So

426
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,759
Sigma

427
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,259
Sigma I didn't know how many people

428
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,419


429
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,559
are there?

430
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,819


431
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,880


432
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,520
The project is

433
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,280
open source, and

434
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,459
the very famous bull teams from overseas

435
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,299


436
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:21,959


437
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,359
are investigating new attack methods every day,

438
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,919
and they are releasing

439
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,100
this Sigma architecture in this form of resignation for

440
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,540


441
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,400
free.It has become

442
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,140
the global standard for log-based IOCs.

443
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,140
In

444
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,100


445
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,059
addition to Windows,

446
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,919
there is also a version that communicates with the cloud or Mac, but

447
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,039


448
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,700


449
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,600
I haven't used Windows

450
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,660
events

451
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,700


452
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,679
yet.  But

453
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,260
another great thing is

454
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,679


455
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600


456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240


457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,299
that Sing can be converted to

458
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,260
any team

459
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,900


460
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,440
query.  Even if you use spank

461
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,400
MicrosoftDefe  Even if you use nder,

462
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,480
it's

463
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,140
probably possible for any team to use any language,

464
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,520


465
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
so I think anyone can use cymbals

466
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520


467
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,760
.

468
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,020
So, what's important is

469
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,960
the logic of this

470
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,539


471
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,240
technique, and I'm looking for synnetures that

472
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,500
are roughly in this structure.

473
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,640


474
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559


475
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600


476
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,940


477
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,320


478
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,400


479
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,740
You can easily create rules like Condensation Suduction and Not

480
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,620


481
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,360
Fiotar. If you want to try a little more than the new model,

482
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,500
I recommend this test site.

483
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,360
Hayabusa Duel is

484
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,419
a service set called Sigma

485
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,700
.

486
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,400
If it's compatible, it'll be destroyed, but in the same

487
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,260
way

488
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,419


489
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,240
you can convert it to a different team like Spankferry, but

490
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,700
sometimes we're expanding that single a little bit,

491
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,020
so sometimes

492
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,320
you can't convert it, but it doesn't matter,

493
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,780
but most of it can be converted.

494
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,039
It's a very

495
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,220
long story, so if

496
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,320
you want to know more

497
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
, read the lead of this Hiboost Roots repository D.

498
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,440
Well, the main difference is

499
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,419
that if you're a singer, you define tool loss in this tool source

500
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,799
category.

501
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,440
It's

502
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,980
called

503
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,120


504
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,620
Hayabusa, but it's defined as a

505
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620


506
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,039
channel name and an event ID

507
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,039


508
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,980
.

509
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,400


510
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,820
I've also listed the source of this tool, so if it detects a detection, I'll

511
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,280


512
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,600
also

513
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,580
use this filter condition. The

514
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,320
falcon

515
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,080
actually

516
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840


517
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,000
has a lot of options, a lot of options so that it can be highly customized,

518
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,940
but I usually

519
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,419
use this green option.  That's

520
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,160


521
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200


522
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,299


523
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,299
why we've made it so that everyone from beginners to frame check processors can use it in a wide range of

524
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,179


525
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,320


526
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,620


527
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,500
ways.  i

528
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,700
think i have an opinion  So we've

529
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
made it easy to customize the

530
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,940
data

531
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,220
that's output.I checked and found that the

532
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,919
processing time doesn't change that much, but if

533
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,760
you save a lot of data, the

534
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,020
output file will

535
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,900
more than double.

536
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,360


537
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,740


538
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,299


539
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,640
You need to select a profile that you think is correct.

540
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,940
Then create the distribution result and import it into Time

541
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,100
Inex

542
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,059
Expo World,

543
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,000
and you will see a French timer like this

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,580
.

545
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,860


546
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,659


547
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:03,059


548
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,580


549
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,720
Just by looking at it, you can tell what kind of attack it is, when and

550
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,000
where it's the accessor.

551
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,360


552
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,780
If

553
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,500


554
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,000
you can

555
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,299
use the feed information and judge whether or not it has been detected,

556
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,039


557
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,340
you can create a stack or a

558
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,179
spank, and

559
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,780
you can also create a dashboard or a timeline like this

560
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,059


561
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,360
with the latest functions.

562
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,620
We can also provide a summary of the results of that HTML At

563
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,260
the end of the test, the

564
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,400
date on which you had the highest number of

565
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,820
incidents, when the incident occurred, which

566
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,780
devices were

567
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,659
compromised, and what kind of

568
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:01,559
attack was

569
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,539
used.

570
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,059
Just by looking at the defaults, you can generally

571
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,640
understand, so

572
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,900


573
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,240
I think the Bull Team will be able to respond to the incident very quickly

574
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,980
, and this single update

575
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,640
is all

576
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640


577
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,340
thanks to Mr.

578
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,419


579
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:31,919
HB and Mr. Takai.

580
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,360


581
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,140
Of course, if there are more etymologies than necessary,

582
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,539
it will be difficult to

583
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,700
confirm,

584
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,840
so

585
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,400
it's better to tune it or something like that, but we scan it so that it

586
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,299
can be detected to some extent.

587
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,059
Without it

588
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,000


589
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,179
, I think it would be possible to detect Tao attacks and behavioral attacks.So

590
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,520
, in the end, it

591
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,960
will be necessary for an expert to confirm it with the monasticism.A

592
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,740
simple example is

593
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,260
the creation of an administrator

594
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,120
account.  or whether it

595
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,559
is

596
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,360
an account created by an attacker or

597
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,500


598
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,900
not.

599
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,100


600
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,900


601
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,520
I'm often asked what it is, so

602
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,919
I compared the main features and

603
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,159
stopped here

604
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,360
.

605
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,299


606
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,740


607
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,240


608
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,960
As for reversal advice, first of all

609
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,919


610
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,720


611
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,380
, I think it's better to go through the whole name in Rome because it will

612
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,980


613
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,419
eat up in the order of your level.  There are people who spend their time

614
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,659
digging deeper into your technique or something about you, who appears

615
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,700


616
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,220
first, but

617
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,760
it's very important that you put on your overalls first.

618
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,640


619
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,159
If you come up with a file name or something like this Peppet keyword,

620
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,600
if you create a word that matches Inders and

621
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,980


622
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,500
search Grape, you will find

623
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,220
other

624
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,580
evidence.

625
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,120


626
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,179


627
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,039


628
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,940


629
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,020


630
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,240


631
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,620


632
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,299
I think that there are many people who are in charge of Excel if possible, but it's

633
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,600
not for frenzied research, so I use

634
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,500


635
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,720
time eye nex borders and other

636
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,200
stags as much as possible.  I think it's better if you contact me, and I'll

637
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,320


638
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,700


639
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,620


640
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,860
fix it.The

641
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,260


642
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,559
function I'm thinking of making from now on is to do

643
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,559
periodic tests on a square terminal

644
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,679
and send the results to cm, or something like

645
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,000
Windows.  In addition to event talks, we are

646
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,900


647
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,440


648
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,200


649
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,919
thinking about cloud tools and communication and guidance log attack detection, etc. Today we will officially

650
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,520
release a new tool

651
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,080


652
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,299


653
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,520
.

654
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,039
It's developed in an interesting language. It

655
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,779


656
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,880
's a simple ticket language like Python,

657
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,299
but

658
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,820
it can be compiled into C

659
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,659
, so it's

660
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,919
very fast and

661
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080


662
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,360


663
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,580
safe like Dust.

664
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,640


665
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,090
I'm thinking of creating an analysis function

666
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,179
[Music]

667
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,799
For example,

668
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,419
a timeline of videos like weather,

669
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,799


670
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:29,039


671
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,059
a process tree visualization of malicious processes like edr, etc.

672
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:35,880
If possible, I'd like to use machine learning to analyze their behavior.

673
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,600
with analysis  And

674
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,960
finally, if there are

675
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,240
people who want to study more or want to contribute in some way,

676
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,120
there are many

677
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,059


678
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,919
things I can do for them.

679
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,900


680
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,640
The team's

681
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,799
C2 framework and other such attack

682
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,360
tools are by far the most numerous, so from now on,

683
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,460
if we don't create more Blue Team tools so that we won't lose to attackers, I

684
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,460


685
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,360


686
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,779
think we'll be in a state of losing forever

687
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:16,679


688
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,820
.

689
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,600
If you don't mind, please join us. Yamato: If you

690
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,360
don't want to contribute to Shige Security and want

691
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,880
to create a tool that you

692
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,700
can use yourself, I think you should

693
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,900
definitely

694
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,419
create one.

695
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:37,799


696
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,140


697
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,220


698
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,260
So, I'm open to the public now that it would be nice if I could make a lot of things.I think that

699
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
it will not only contribute to the community,

700
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,440
but it will also be useful

701
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,539
for me.It will take 30 minutes

702
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,779
.

703
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,980
Thank you

704
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,940
very much, everyone.

705
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,010
