: If

64
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,540
you ask me

65
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,840
, it's been 10 miracles.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,620
From

69
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,780
to the highly social topic of fake press releases, everyone agrees that it is filled with a wide range of fields and a high level of expertise.

70
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,620


71

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,140
Among them, I had Neil Wire

74
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,940


75
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,480
, a regular customer with a 20-year career who has blown away with Black Hat, for the

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,340


77
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,799


78
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,260
keynote speech at the plenary session.

79
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,239
At this time in October,

80
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,780
he sacrificed that, and he came all

81
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,360
the way from the United States and Lake City to

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,379


83
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,939
Japan for the plenary session.

84
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,500


85
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,680


86
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,279


87
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,040
As a family conference

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,540


89
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,680
, I think this Code Blue has grown sufficiently.Congratulations to all of you,I

90

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,660


93
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,740


94
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,780
wonder how long it's been since you've had a face-to-face meeting like

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,520


96
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,120
this.Until last year, as you know, it was held only online due to corona measures.

97
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,100


98
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,080
I missed the machines.

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,900
This networking party

100
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,040


101
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,620
will be held for the first time in

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,560
3 years. It seems that there will be an exhibition booth for the first time in 3 years. Please enjoy it.

103
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,979


104
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,720


105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
I don't think

106
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,180


107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
so.The 18-meter LED panel you're

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,240


109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,479
looking at is a large device that can withstand the outside light,

110
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
and it's the first permanent installation in Japan

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
.  It was 100,000 yen

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,199
, so if you are tired from the meeting,

113
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,100


114
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,320


115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960
I would like you to rest your eyes on the scenery of Shibuya while enjoying a free cup of coffee

116
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,000
.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,419


118
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,600
I hope

119
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,979
everyone will enjoy the face-to-face Code Blue for the first time in three years

120
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,100


121
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,380


122
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,860
. I hope that

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,780
your network will expand on this occasion

124
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,258

141
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,860
It's been 10 years since Code Blue raised its voice in the air that the Tokyo Olympics were decided.  Since it's our

142
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,699
10th anniversary,

143
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,680
we talk about various things on various occasions and in various places, and

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,660


145
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,600
this year we have 30 student staff members

146
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,500


147
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,139


148
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,259


149
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,840
.  I got a sticker from , but it was

150
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,699
worn out, so I got a new one this year.

151
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,660


152
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,960
He told me with great

153
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,139
joy that it's been that long

154
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,479


155
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,600
.

156
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,360
With that kind of feeling, Code Blue has been held by gathering all

157
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,699


158
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:21,599


159
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,340
kinds of young people and

160
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,060


161
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,860


162
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,440


163
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,520


164
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,660
various people.I think it's been 10

165
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,819
years.  I think there are some people

166
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,800
who have been able to meet face-to-face

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,780
like this, and there are people who are

168
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,580
online.

. Good morning.

182
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,539
I would like to start with a strange analogy

183
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,198
.

184
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,279
Around the year 2000, there was a war in the Middle East.

185
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,458


186
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,039


187
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,360


188
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,680
Boots on the Brown When I was asked not

189
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,620
to come to the scene, it was

190
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,000


191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,339
the members of the Self-Defense Forces who went to the scene.At

192
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,600
that time,

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,380


194
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,940
I thought that everyone had to go to cyberspace,

195
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,399


196
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,420
so I started Black Hat Japan.

197
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,740
The first year was very difficult, and from the second year,

198
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,040
Kana Shinoda, who I mentioned earlier, joined

199
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,899
Blackout Japan and managed to continue several times

200
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,180
. After a

201
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,959
while, Code Blue

202
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,399
started.

203
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,980
I

204
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,200
couldn't continue, but

205
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,480
Code Blue is already in its 10th year this year

206
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,500


207
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,980


208
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,779


209
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,580
.

210
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,279
Mr. Dobleu is a

211
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,899
Japanese person, and there is Japan's first cybersecurity

212
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,760
conference, but I think it's a meeting

213
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,100


214
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,980
where everyone on the earth can say goodbye to the cyberspace field, because it's a boots-on-the-cultivation area

215
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,720


216
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120


217
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,120
.

218
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,200
It's still early in the morning,

219
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,160
so the

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,980
venue may feel a bit disorganized, but

221
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,779


222
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,720
I hear that many

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,779


224
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,760
people are connected online.  By

225
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,040


226
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000


227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
all means, I hope that everyone here and everyone

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
participating

229
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,080
online can protect cyberspace.

230
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440


231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,800


232
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,600
The speaker is Mr.

233
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,279

234
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,959
was a staff member of Blackout Japan

235
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,720
and has been active for a

236
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,680


237
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
long

238
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
time

239
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,420


240
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,339


241
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,180
.

242
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,599
giving a speech

243
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,750
[applause]
