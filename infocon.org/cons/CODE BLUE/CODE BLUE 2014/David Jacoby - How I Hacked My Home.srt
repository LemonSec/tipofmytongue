1
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,019
is always difficult to be the last
person speaking

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,219
I know that you are

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,439
i'd I am very tired myself and I can see
in all your face is that you just want

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:21,460
to have some coffee

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,380
I'll try to make it fast a and over you
enjoy this presentation it's a little

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,369
bit special

7
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:35,369
I made the entire presentation in
Microsoft Paint

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,210
my my daughter actually told me daddy
you have the best job

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,440
in the entire world because you can
travel the world

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,510
do presentations go to very nice places
and then when you come home

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,970
you can paint so I do think I have the
best job in the entire world

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,030
I'm here to talk about some

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,750
the things that the previous speakers
did talk about I'm going to talk about

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,089
how I hacked

15
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:11,470
my home this presentation is also a
special because

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,930
the viability is that I found has not
been fixed

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,820
I have reported them for over one year
ago

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,520
but they have not fixed the viability as
yet so I actually had to censor my

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,540
presentation

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,030
because when I'm going to do it I'm
going to do some live demonstration on

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,190
to hack a device that I brought from
Sweden

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,910
this is the light the device this is the
only device I can

23
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,470
I can Brinker's my suitcase is not big
enough to bring a TV

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,729
so who will I

25
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,430
I am David Jacoby I am for a security
researcher

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,770
yes this is me I work at security lab
since about

27
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,530
four-and-a-half years ago joined the
company I'm

28
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,119
responsible for security research in the
Nordic region

29
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,410
and also the Benelux region I'm also one
of the

30
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,720
security in banja lists I do travel
quite a bit them due to conferences and

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,380
and meet a lot of nice people I met in
bar design we meet at every conference

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,300
around the world

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,700
last time was in Seattle Satoh before
that

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,060
Dominican Republic very nice place some
a security researcher but I'm also

35
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,190
a retro Greek sexy M

36
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,670
very very very excited to be in Tokyo
Japan right now

37
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,840
because you have a lot a retro gaming
things

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,630
I do love a.m. for those who can see in

39
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,650
Atari

40
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,819
and I do love all these a

41
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,420
old computers I am actually probably one
of the few people

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,420
around the world that still buys VHS
tapes and laserdisc

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,780
and yesterday in in one of the

44
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,790
weird shop that I visited I actually
bought five Japanese horror movies

45
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,380
and that's because I'm a very big her
inner nerd I love horror movies

46
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,110
especially Japanese horror movies but
that's not what I'm here are actually

47
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,980
here too

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,590
that talked a little about this is there
anyone in the audience

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,290
that knows what that is this is what
I've been doing

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,360
for fifteen years before joining
Kaspersky

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,030
no one

52
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:25,030
I've been doing pen testing

53
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,280
to coming up though

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,330
so I have a background during
penetration testing

55
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,730
and in my job when I was doing
penetration testing all the reports and

56
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,310
some other research that I found

57
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,210
led me to this a.m. this is going to

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,780
security conference around the world
that

59
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,640
people think that going to security
conference is because you want to learn

60
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,370
things

61
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,000
you want to learn the latest tips and
tricks you wanna learn something about

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,830
security

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,000
but it's not that just a big lie this a
big excuse to go to security conference

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,040
because all you want to do is networking
party I can see in your face that you

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,700
really

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,190
that you really wanna go party tonight
and then and

67
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,400
another thing most a few

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,239
will not remember the presentations that
you have seen today

69
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,640
and that's a fact that's why is
completely useless to think that you're

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,760
going to learn things by going to
security conference cuz you can just

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
read my blog post afterwards

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,560
but anyway

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,879
a.m. well let's go back before I talk
about how I hacked my home

74
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,240
I actually wanna talk about what I think

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,330
IT security is I know that Karen talk a
little bit about this this morning and I

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,310
would just wanna share my own view

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,610
and hopefully you will agree with my
view on IT security

78
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,669
so we have this guy this case the
security officer

79
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,090
and he will tell us that we need to work
with security

80
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,180
whatever that means we have to work with
IT security we have to be secure

81
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,949
but when someone tells me that we need
to be secure

82
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:15,229
let's pretend I am the technician in the
managers to telling me

83
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,909
we have to be secure the thing is

84
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:23,150
I get really excited when someone tells
me that we have to be secure because

85
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,190
then I have to

86
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,190
run penetration test I can buy software
can be tools I can do

87
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,509
some kind of configuration and audits I
can do a lot of things

88
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,150
the problem is when I tried to explain

89
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,509
to the management what we're doing in
the

90
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,190
to actually build security we don't
really speak the same language

91
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,909
IT guy is and management don't really
speak the same language so the

92
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,880
management

93
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,360
they don't really understand what we are
saying we're talking about

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,389
fixing buffer overflows patch management
network segmentation were

95
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,419
authentication this is all the stuff
that management don't understand

96
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,210
so that they look at us to say we don't
understand but there's one language that

97
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,370
they do understand

98
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,110
which is money

99
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,930
the money language

100
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,020
and for some reason it doesn't matter
how little money

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,930
the IT department asked for is always
too much

102
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,800
especially for a company who has not
been

103
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,270
a victim for an accident they will say
we're not going to spend this money

104
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,100
sorry doesn't matter how little money
you ask for and while we're fighting

105
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,610
what do you think the bad guys are doing
of course they are continually trying to

106
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:41,960
act

107
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,070
attack our systems are trying to test
our network

108
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,080
in one thing that we've seen as a trend
they also tried to look at our reaction

109
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,080
because they will send

110
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,140
exploit code they will send by
resistance Trojans and they will see how

111
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,640
our system tracked do we have the file
do we have antivirus do we have proxies

112
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,000
do we have log management system do we
have all that and if we do

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,260
yeah they will customize the attack to
try to avoid the system

114
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,480
okay and then they just go all in

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,040
and the hackers right they work 24 /7
the try to compromise our network maybe

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,380
they do like in bar they go to some
restaurant and try to

117
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,160
hacked the there the payment system

118
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,920
and it doesn't matter this is very
important

119
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,390
doesn't matter how much money you
already spent a night to security

120
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,930
for some reason they always win this guy
locked his bike

121
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,930
but do you think it worked

122
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,240
right for some

123
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,330
reason his protection did not work right

124
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,790
because the attacker had a a new way of
a exploiting the system

125
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,030
and we don't understand where the attack
is coming from

126
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,280
right

127
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,820
we will look in our antivirus product or
we will look into a log management

128
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,600
system

129
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,980
and would if we don't understand how the
vulnerability worse how are we going to

130
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,710
protect it

131
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,240
how are we going to protect ourselves
against an attack that you do known

132
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,460
do you don't know anything about it's
impossible right

133
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,200
this is actually my favorites like I
love this one

134
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm up

135
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,750
okay so what happened after we get
compromised

136
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,780
what happens we get humiliated

137
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,320
right they will publish our emails our
passwords our database

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,940
are sensitive data they were everything
will be a

139
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,530
written about in the media in newspapers
and we get humiliated

140
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,680
right and when we see that our company
has been compromised

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,020
how do we react we are a bunch of
crybabies

142
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,620
and that's true we

143
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,660
are very childish in our reaction we get
very upset that we almost

144
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,340
want to wear to have revenge on the hat
attackers

145
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,890
but how do you think the attackers react
when they compromise the company what is

146
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,740
their reaction

147
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,440
well the bad guys they like money

148
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,940
and this is important because all your
data

149
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,530
even a simple thing as an email address
is worth money on the black market

150
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,460
just imagine how much money full access

151
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,830
full administrative access to a network
is

152
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,380
how much is that worth quite a lot of
money so

153
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,570
now we see a trend that the attackers is
actually out for money

154
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,770
not just for fame they actually want
money because they can sell this

155
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,480
information

156
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,960
and one of his

157
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,560
problems with this is that we don't
understand what the problem is

158
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,370
the IT guys is saying

159
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,370
we don't have enough time to fix the
viability is

160
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,000
we don't have enough money to fix the
viability is we have different

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,630
priority so we can affect the viability
is and the management is saying

162
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,720
why didn't you fix the viability you
should fix this

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,089
but if we don't have time and resources
or money

164
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,320
how are we going to fix the problem and
if we don't even know what the

165
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,040
problem is how are we going to fix it
because we in the industry

166
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,870
we have a really big problem and now I
want everyone to listen cuz this is very

167
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,580
important

168
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,140
as a security researcher I'm fed up

169
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,810
with other security researchers and
including myself

170
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:48,560
that's trying to predict the future do
you know how many times I get the

171
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,330
question

172
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:55,630
what kind of threats do you think we
will see in the future it's not relevant

173
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,970
because we cannot fix the stuff that we
have been talking about for 30 years

174
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,430
so why should I try to predict the
future

175
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,890
if we're still viable as we saw in the
last presentation

176
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,290
annenberg presentation and I haven't
seen all the presentations days but

177
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,180
we've probably seen it

178
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,650
in other presentation as well the bar
abilities that we are

179
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,130
actually vulnerable against is 30 years
old

180
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,540
why should I care about the next
generation threats

181
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,920
think about that so

182
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,520
the company's compromised there's always
a smart guy saying

183
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,400
we have a recovery plan we will fix this
I'm very positive we will fix this

184
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,620
and now they also have proof that they
need to spend money and time and

185
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,540
resources on IT security

186
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,800
so they tried to fix everything at once
they will replace printers routers

187
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,670
he'll buy server servers they will have
consultants they will do a lot of things

188
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,800
to fix the network but still

189
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,360
if you don't know what you were viable
against

190
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,280
how are we going to fix it you cannot

191
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,920
so we work 24 /7

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,170
without knowing what the problem is and
we tried to fix this

193
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,690
right we do all these things

194
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,000
but does it help

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,710
we have this fantasy this view on that

196
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,910
when we're done this is how the firewall
should be this is how our security

197
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,480
should be

198
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,520
the attacker should use just be bouncing
off

199
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,840
from our system they should not be able
to attack us

200
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,860
and then we had the sales guys

201
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,380
and I'm probably going to be fired for
selling this but this affect everyone

202
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,850
this is

203
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,070
effect all the sales guys because they
will read in the media that

204
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,300
this company to compromise and then they
will go to this company is a

205
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,200
buy our product by our service cuz that
will help you

206
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,280
but still if you don't know what you
were parable against

207
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,280
how can you choose a product that works
some ideas are actually you

208
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,250
really really bad even if I do like this
idea

209
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:13,250
very much some people are just too
stupid to actually own a computer

210
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,240
and some ideas are actually really
really good

211
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,890
but the problem is that they're selling

212
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,840
an entire concept they're selling a
system that we don't really know

213
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,310
how it works how many in this audience
juices

214
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,710
automated bar military scanning no one

215
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:44,140
no one automated mobility scanning

216
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,070
sell it the problem is that

217
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,260
tube for sample B compliant for PCI or
some other ice the standard you have to

218
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,910
do

219
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,340
automated viability scanning there
several vendors who is doing this

220
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,570
but just imagine that you have a file or
a directory

221
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,080
written in your local language my local
languages Swedish

222
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,340
and the Swedish word for password is no
standard

223
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,190
just imagine that I have a file on my
web server

224
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,700
called nurse in order doc doc txt
containing

225
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,630
all my passwords there's no automated

226
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,100
are billeted scanner in the entire world
that will find

227
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,030
that file because it looks for password
Arctic steam

228
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,320
it does not look for Swedish words or
Japanese words

229
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,690
or German words or Spanish words or
Italian words

230
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,340
so even that you buy a security product

231
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,370
it might not work if you don't
understand what the product can do for

232
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,760
you

233
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,700
and you don't understand the limitations
with the product you will never be able

234
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
to build security

235
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,300
and they're also quite difficult to
manage custom meant for technicians

236
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,970
demand for IT guys

237
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:01,310
so when you do get the product sometimes
it's very difficult to implement it in

238
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,020
your network

239
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,670
but after a while when you spend time

240
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,400
implementing this product you think that
you have the perfect security right

241
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,850
you think that you have something great
because you fixed everything

242
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,170
but if you don't know what the viability
was in the beginning

243
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:26,170
how can you fix it this guy by some very
nice lock for the gate

244
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,470
hoops really

245
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,690
he didn't think that through

246
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,620
so what do you think happens after him

247
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,320
implement that his security if we didn't
know

248
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,340
what the problem is how can we buy

249
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,410
or use or fix our problems so

250
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:00,060
we had hacked again right I don't know
why there are so many Asian people in

251
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,140
this funny pictures

252
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,440
but listen to me now

253
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,990
listen to me now I'm here to talk to you
about how I hacked my home

254
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,870
this is important this is me hacking my
own

255
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,960
so

256
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,800
why did I choose to do is why did I
choose to hack my own home

257
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,100
it sounds like a very bad idea but the
thing is

258
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,480
I was looking it looking into
network-connected devices

259
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,220
and I was searching for the term
Internet of Things which I don't like

260
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,950
either but I was searching for it and
trying to see what kinda

261
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,870
other research has been published has
been written about

262
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,970
and one very common a

263
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,530
research is in this guy who finds a
refrigerator

264
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,020
researchers a refrigerator that is
connected to the network

265
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,310
and allows him to send spam from the
river refrigerator

266
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,120
promise story that most if you guys have
heard the other story

267
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,250
is about to a American researchers

268
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,500
Charlie and Chris who hacked

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,800
a Toyota car right the problem with
these attacks

270
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,409
is that the head exploit make sure the
attack vector

271
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,010
is extremely stupid for example the
payload

272
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,089
the reason why you could compromise the
car with the what what happened when you

273
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:26,410
could

274
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,300
compromise the car is that you can for
example changed at the level of fuel in

275
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,430
the car you can

276
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,150
turn things on and off like care signals
and you can also turn up the brakes

277
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,500
and and those things but if you want to
kill someone

278
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,980
do you want to be

279
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,260
inside the car when you turn up the
brakes

280
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,040
because the attack is that you have to
use your own computer

281
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,220
with the cable connected to the car

282
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,710
have a special written program that will
allow it to

283
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,299
shut off the brakes but you have to be
inside the car when that happens

284
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,080
so once again do you want to be inside a
car when you turn off the brakes

285
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,929
now not if you don't want to commit
suicide but

286
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,120
it's a bit is a is quite difficult X
exploit vector

287
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,540
attack vector so I thought the center
focusing on

288
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,570
these products like a refrigerator or a
car

289
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,919
I decided to look into my own home what
do I actually have

290
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,120
in my home right now cuz

291
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,270
I don't know about you but I personally
do not have a refrigerated that's

292
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,500
connected to my network

293
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,160
do you guys know what anyone who has a
refrigerator

294
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,510
that that refrigerators connected to the
network

295
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,190
now

296
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,860
so if I find my abilities and I talk
about something that no one uses how

297
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,830
how effective is I decided to see what
do I have

298
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,500
in my home and I'm a security no to be
working the security industry for many

299
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,330
many years

300
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,520
and I thought I don't have that meant
many

301
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,820
items so I thought how do I actually get

302
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,900
these devices known legal you go to a
retail shop

303
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,010
a any by a TV and there's a sales person
trying to sell this TV to you

304
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,530
and I don't know but Japan between the
always tried to sell the TV with the

305
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,429
most functions

306
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,960
even as Bluetooth and WiFi and to make
our free

307
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,110
and can clean your floor and can do the
dishes then is a good TV

308
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,870
right so we we buy these devices

309
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,260
without actually knowing what we going
to use all these functions for

310
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,860
ask yourself if you would buy a new TV
tomorrow

311
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,070
would you buy a TV with what WiFi or
without wifi

312
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,210
most people probably by with WiFi right

313
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,470
then ask you why do you need wifi

314
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,990
streaming is not very popular in Sweden
yet

315
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,820
if you do have some kinda streaming
service its through the digital box and

316
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,370
not through the TV directly to the TV
itself

317
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,860
does not really need wifi but after we
bought this device the sales guys this

318
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,820
is the sales guys at the bottom

319
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,130
this is the reaction when we leave the
store Chris

320
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,620
this all the more expensive product for
us and they made more money

321
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,030
and what did we get we get actually more
viable device

322
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,250
but OK hacking my home

323
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,390
like a boss in my home I had

324
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,780
so long many devices which it was a
surprise for me

325
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,600
I had to TVs connected to my

326
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,490
network I had to Blu ray players
connected to my TV

327
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,830
it to my network I had a satellite box
connected to my TV

328
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,360
I had an Apple TV I had a PlayStation 3

329
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,860
I have a network router I have two
storage devices

330
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,200
and I actually have a Commodore 64
connect to a network

331
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,230
don't ask me why I just have it but that
was over eleven

332
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,100
product that's connected to my home
network and this is product which I have

333
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,990
zero

334
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,420
control over so I started to look into

335
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,950
this different devices and I started
with my two network storage devices

336
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,790
and i was just thinking can I find any
vulnerabilities in these devices

337
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,900
within 20 minutes

338
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,170
I had remote code execution as root

339
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:31,200
on the device and as we saw in the
previous presentation

340
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,210
this device was viable to some

341
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,900
very similar our abilities you send an
argument

342
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,920
and the argument was passed to a system
function which executed everything as

343
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,400
root

344
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,590
no authentication no nothing

345
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,170
and we in the security industry

346
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,300
once again need to take more
responsibility

347
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,260
what we talk about and how we help
people to improve security

348
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,930
between the industry has been talking
about doing backups

349
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,820
for

350
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,720
twenty years maybe thirty years and what
we're doing we're actually taking

351
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,570
creating a backup from our laptops and
storing them

352
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,929
on a device that more but that's more
viable than the computer itself

353
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,200
and isn't that strange that we take
what's very very sensitive

354
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,919
and we store it on a device that's has
no security whatsoever

355
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,809
so we need to take more responsibility
and how we teach people security

356
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:35,059
after this I decided she is there
anything else I can do

357
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,960
can I find more mobility so it was very
logical or abilities which allowed me to

358
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,970
download entire configuration file

359
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,120
of the device was even if the device
requires a username and password for

360
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,419
getting access to the administrative
interface you can just download the

361
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,720
configuration file

362
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,799
and that's a password in cleartext since
is running

363
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,150
a small Linux machine a with gcc

364
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,230
with pearl with Python with bash I have
a lot of possibilities to

365
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,960
store files because it's a it has two
terabytes of hard drive so there's no

366
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,200
problem storing files

367
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,650
in so what I did as i download a small
poll script

368
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,280
which is a small back to which connects
from the device

369
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,600
out on the Internet tonight number that
I control which means that once the

370
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,220
devices

371
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,919
is infected I have access to the
internal network at any time

372
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,580
very simple very simple stuff a very
effective

373
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,030
but this was from my own local area
network right

374
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,120
and people ashley is a David this is
this is still stupid because you have to

375
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,429
be

376
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:47,159
inside the network to exploit this this
is not true

377
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,320
yes it was on the local area network

378
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,830
but there are very many ways

379
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,240
where you can exploit this from the
internet even if the device

380
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,520
is not listening on any port on the
Internet if it's only listening to

381
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,200
internal

382
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,970
IP numbers you can still exploiters it
does require

383
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,710
some interaction from a device that is
connected to

384
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,720
your network for sampling hi

385
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,000
a tablet or a mobile phone or a computer

386
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,130
any devise that can interpret the
JavaScript

387
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,950
can trigger this far abilities and I'm
going to demonstrate that today

388
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,040
it before we do that I just want to
demonstrate

389
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,750
how I was able to to access the
configuration file

390
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,810
I will not disclosure that exact
probability

391
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,350
thats this is just a small demo so

392
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,310
I made a small program called the nasdaq
ur and

393
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,020
which allows me to download the entire
configuration file

394
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,840
there we go

395
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,950
the username encrypt the password

396
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,410
very simple to practice passwords

397
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,590
and if I want

398
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,010
i connect

399
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,180
also get code execution but once again

400
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,530
this is from the local area network how
do I trigger this

401
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:22,530
remotely

402
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,310
so we're looking into the bar abilities
I found that 92 percent

403
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,540
of the bugs was located in the PHP code

404
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,950
there were so many running demons that

405
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,450
actually I don't have had time to look
into all these bet

406
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,230
there was a total of 22 viability isn't
just a PHP code

407
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,600
I had a sly with all their technical
details but I had to remove them

408
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,110
for privacy reasons but I can tell you
that all of the 22 Mar abilities in the

409
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,050
PHP code

410
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,880
was the same our ability as we saw in
the previous presentation

411
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,530
everything was just sent directly to the
system function in twenty two places

412
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,420
in the PHP code so

413
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,180
this is my demonstration on how to do
this remotely

414
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,980
and this this type of attack

415
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,780
can be used to attack any devise on your
local area network not just my storage

416
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,350
device

417
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,460
so this is me in the top corner

418
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,410
the square guy and then we have the
Internet we have a firewall

419
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,550
and I haven't my devices behind a
firewall 10 they attack vectors

420
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,750
trying to demonstrate right now is that
I send you an email

421
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,750
or a Facebook message or something

422
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,080
with the link you know how we'd normally
use social media we click on

423
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,320
on links too funny videos and we look at
the funny videos and we press like in

424
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,040
we do all that stuff to just pretend
that I'm sending a link

425
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,210
to a website with the funny video

426
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,990
while you're watching the video
something's happening in the background

427
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,420
because when you click on the link you
access my website

428
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,550
and on my website there is this funny
video and this

429
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,480
also affects any iPad iPad or tablet or

430
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,940
or mobile phone not just computers and
when you're looking at my video

431
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,110
there is something magical happening in
the background is very simple what I'm

432
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,850
doing

433
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,700
is I'm enumerating internal IP numbers

434
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,190
on your network because I'm pretty sure
that I can guess your internal IP number

435
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,730
range

436
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,140
in your home I'm pretty sure is 192

437
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,780
168 0 0 or

438
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,760
192

439
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,740
168 one 0 or

440
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,900
10 that 0 0 0 right

441
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,150
if I can guess this

442
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,620
range I can guess IP numbers that

443
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,230
inside that range through a javascript
and all these devices

444
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,330
that we have collected in our homes most
of them have a web server

445
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,220
and by connecting to the web server
looking for a specific path

446
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,169
for sample to a picture I can enumerate
the device

447
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,840
I can see this is a storage device this
is a TV

448
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,320
this is a Blu ray player this is a
printer this is something 'cause

449
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,080
maybe the logo for the company hassle as
an image stored on the web server

450
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,980
something that static something that I
can

451
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,120
measure that if this image sexist I know

452
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,669
is that kind of kind of device and if I
know

453
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:38,030
what kind of device it is it's very
simple for me to send my exploit code

454
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,230
and I thought that we're going to
demonstrate that right now hope it works

455
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,470
because it's 100 percent live

456
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,370
so I really hope it works on this
machine

457
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,630
I am pretending that I am an attacker
somewhere on the internet

458
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:58,630
listening for incoming connections right

459
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,340
and I'm going to my my website where
have this funny video

460
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,549
right well we're watching

461
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,619
the video CIA been included a funny
video look at the top left

462
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:23,220
scanning for device one to

463
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:29,119
3 45 and so on there we go

464
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:35,059
we found a viable device what if I

465
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:40,480
just wanna look at the configuration
file

466
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,559
or let's say that I want to have

467
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,600
come on execution on this device

468
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,549
look at my terminal here I now have a
connection and

469
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,499
I didn't do anything I just visited the
website and I got a connection

470
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:05,499
let's do it one more time just look at
this screen are now in the background

471
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:14,320
we're doing the same scan over and over
again is looking for the internal IP

472
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,399
number as soon as it finds the device

473
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,649
it will send exploit code the machine

474
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:24,100
will connect to the internet to my
device that I controlled my command and

475
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,820
control server

476
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,820
I have full access to this device now

477
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,330
very simple and this is why you're
washing

478
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,610
funny video on the internet and this
works from any device

479
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,519
tablet phone computer as long as it
connected to the same network

480
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:52,519
as you are

481
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,060
so what about the other devices what
about the TV that

482
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,340
I was looking into the TV and I thought

483
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,180
now when I compromised the storage
device can I use the storage device to

484
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,190
somehow

485
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,370
access to TV cuz you know some TVs have

486
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,890
network sharing they can read a files
from a network share

487
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:21,550
they have the some smart application
Skype Twitter Facebook all these

488
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,650
but the profits have you ever tried to
use

489
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,940
a TV on the Internet like going to you
too

490
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,780
with the normal remote that you get from
the most remote

491
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,350
the normal remote from the TV it totally
sucks

492
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,020
chris is secured your steering the mouse
pointer

493
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,680
very very difficult and eventually
sometime if you're lucky

494
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,350
you you're able to click on the search
field and then you have to type

495
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,580
something to search for on the remote
its such

496
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,770
it takes so long time it's not very
convenient right

497
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,900
so having WiFi or network access to the
TV might be complete

498
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,930
can I use useless but I thought is there
any way I can attack this and I found

499
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,780
nothing

500
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,820
I found no attack vectors that worked
until one day when I was

501
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,950
running a packet sniffer and i was just

502
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,150
trying to access the menus on the TV

503
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,470
and 10 was accessing the menu on the TV
I noticed that

504
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,970
the TV sent some really strange traffic
to the vendor's Web sites

505
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,740
because what happen is that when you
access the menu

506
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,130
all the smart applications

507
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,260
is being downloaded because they want to
have the latest version

508
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,600
directly from the vendor's Web Site
without using HTTPS or any signing or

509
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,590
any certificates

510
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,760
which means that you could do perform a
man in the middle attack

511
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,540
on the TV and I tried to do that

512
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,590
and I noticed that yes it is possible

513
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,840
I can inject whatever kind of code I
want on the TV

514
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,750
I know is that the TV was running very
very very old software

515
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:06,500
even at the TV was pretty nu and may I
ask you how often do you buy a new TV

516
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:13,150
be once per year twice

517
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,160
every second year every fifty year

518
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,270
me personally i buy maybe a TV every
fifty-year

519
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:25,790
any by told you that you had software
var abilities in your TV right now would

520
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,190
you will go to the local store and buy a
new TV

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,870
now we have a problem

522
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,920
that even that we know that we have our
abilities in our

523
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,810
our network connected devices we're not
doing anything about it because it's a

524
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,050
financial problem we cannot afford

525
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,240
buying a new TV it's too expensive
because every time there's a viability

526
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,940
should we buy a new TV

527
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,870
or a new storage device or a new printer
it's impossible

528
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,520
but I decided to to do a demo does
anyone know Borat

529
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,730
have anyone seen the movie Borat the
actual ash

530
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,470
important I decided to see if I could

531
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,490
inject some code into my TV so I
injected a picture of Borat

532
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,810
and now I have a picture Bora in my TV

533
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:16,649
which totally sucks but the problem with
his research is that I couldn't continue

534
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:20,200
it cuz I wanted to find code execution
our ability on the TV

535
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,870
I couldn't continue it because I paid

536
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,290
from my own pocket for this TV and if I

537
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,340
if I continue the research I was afraid
that I will break the TV

538
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,649
which I paid a lot of money for and do
you know how difficult it is for me to

539
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,179
explain for my daughter

540
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,740
why she can't watch Scooby Doo Chris
daddy worked on the TV

541
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,950
no that will not work you know

542
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,919
she will be very upset when I hate when
I broke the TV because I needed to work

543
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,980
cycling continues I contact the vendor
and asked them can you please provide me

544
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,360
with more information more technically
information

545
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,980
about this device and the answer I got
was

546
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:06,980
you seem to be a smart guy you can
probably figure it out yourself

547
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,140
so work in progress

548
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,390
I'm still working on trying to find

549
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,990
the both our abilities and some
solutions on how to fix this

550
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,240
the vendors of course in all the
viability as defenders has been notified

551
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,230
with everything

552
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,430
and and in my router's

553
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,300
I know that we just saw a presentation
about writers a I did not find the same

554
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,440
abilities as

555
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,950
these guys I found something completely
different I found hidden

556
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,280
functions within the router in the
administrative interface and my first

557
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,109
question was

558
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:46,960
who has access to these functions I'm
logged in as administrator on my device

559
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,880
but there's someone who has even more
access to this device that I have

560
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,290
I also noticed that the device was
running very also offer including the

561
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,450
UPnP protocol the mint to maybe the

562
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,820
my Radaris parable to the same thing as
as the previous speakers just

563
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,530
mention and I don't know why I have
three ghosts or a snake

564
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,930
in this presentation but I just like
them they were nice so is my device back

565
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:14,380
toward

566
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,670
is my main question if someone has
access to my device

567
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,600
who is that person because is not me
this is a screenshot of the device

568
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,670
I tried to blur their their product name

569
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,730
but as you can see in the left menu

570
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,780
you have different selections in
different different submenus you have

571
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,400
resembled broadband connection

572
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,720
and the first value after broadband
connection is DSL connection

573
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,750
and then you have internet service so

574
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,050
it should be that the first value should
be DSR correction in the second value

575
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,570
should be

576
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,730
Internet services but this is not the
case

577
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,320
because as you can see I'm maybe you can
achieve good wide

578
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,400
highlighted in red it says when sensing

579
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,109
but in the menu there's no such thing as
when syncing

580
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:05,740
here it's as web cameras

581
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,880
but in the menu there's no such thing as
web cameras

582
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,990
and in this menu have maybe ten
different submenus

583
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,740
the first one the second one the third
one the problem is that

584
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,089
the first one

585
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:21,800
is maybe not the first one the first one
might be the fifth one

586
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,420
because you can simply just modify some
of the values and you can access menus

587
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,480
in the router thats not in the menu list

588
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,579
even I'm logged in as administrator on
this device I personally think

589
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,900
that this is something that the ISP the
Internet Service Provider

590
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,420
actual restricted me from doing because
they don't want

591
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,849
to give the users full access to these
devices

592
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:51,260
I think that's the case but if they have
access to other functions

593
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,270
how difficult do you think it is for an
attacker to get access to the same

594
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,010
functions

595
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,250
well I was researching this something
very very strange happened

596
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,300
I don't know if this is possible in
Japan but in Sweden

597
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,890
this happened I got locked out from my
own device

598
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,740
somehow they probably found out

599
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,559
but I was doing some crazy research on
their device

600
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,089
a locked me out what happened then is
that they sent me a new device

601
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:23,150
and a bill on 50 euros I have no idea
how much that is

602
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,859
in Japanese yen is quite a lot of money

603
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:30,690
Kennedy to do that conversion real quick
50 euros

604
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,640
sayin 65 65

605
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,040
6500 Japanese yen

606
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,369
became a bill that I had to pay for a
new router

607
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:44,410
I don't know why I didn't order any
router

608
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,079
side actually refused to pay that bill
and that was a mistake from me

609
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,549
because what happened when you do you
know what happened when you refuse

610
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:52,530
paying bills

611
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,440
people don't get happy to the common
newsletter

612
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,559
saying if you don't pay will come

613
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,579
and take something worth that money from
your house so of course I had to pay

614
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,200
that money

615
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,920
but I didn't give them my router crazy
people

616
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,819
so what's my point what's my solution
because

617
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:16,579
I can send stand here all they talk
about the different viability as I found

618
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,930
I do have a point my manager asked me

619
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,380
so David you spent about three months
finding viability is a software

620
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,849
and we're an antivirus company why do
spend three months

621
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,580
doing all this stuff all this research

622
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,980
the problem is that we as an industry we
don't know how to do security

623
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,020
we don't get it

624
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,070
we think we know how to do security but
we don't get it

625
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:48,280
one problem is going to security
conference

626
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,339
like this I'm pretty sure that

627
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:54,500
a lot of people a lot of security
researchers are doing

628
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,670
very very very nice work but they're
afraid

629
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,770
to submit a paper to a security
conference because they think that the

630
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,510
only thing that they have to talk about

631
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,619
is super new very high tech super
advanced exploitation techniques

632
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,940
I don't know if you agree with what I'm
saying

633
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,099
lot of people are afraid to talk at a
security conference just a don't think

634
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,520
their research is good enough we have to
somehow break the ice

635
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,440
we have to somehow allow more people to
talk about research

636
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,060
we also need to allow more people to
talk to each other

637
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,119
we need to allow

638
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,890
people to report my abilities to vendors
because what happen is that I reported

639
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,420
all these are abilities to the different
vendors

640
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,790
there was one bender only one vendor

641
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,950
that replied with the positive email
saying

642
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,800
thank you two of the other vendors

643
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,680
said we don't even believe you that
these viability is a real

644
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,630
I had to do a web WebEx session

645
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,160
sharing my desktop actually exploding

646
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,220
every single viability with the
development team from this vendor

647
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,300
for them to understand that the
viability as I submitted to them

648
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,550
was 100 percent correct and even during
the WebEx session

649
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,210
they said your ability does not work on
our device

650
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,530
and the problem is that they didn't know

651
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,830
how to exploit it on their own device
even that I gave them

652
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:31,070
a full working exploit and this is the
problem if the vendors don't even know

653
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:37,160
how to not how to export things but if
they don't know how to review or quality

654
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,790
assured

655
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,310
their own products we have a problem one
of the vendor actually told me

656
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,569
we're not going to

657
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:46,819
fixed his viability because its in a
consumer product

658
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:51,619
so we not going to fix it because the
support life cycle

659
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:56,479
of consumer product it's about six
months so even if you buy a brand new

660
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,410
device

661
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,729
after six months that device will not
get receive any up

662
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:05,829
updates if it does receive updates how
do you know it secured updates

663
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:09,859
so we have

664
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:13,289
now where we have attackers we have
hackers we have people

665
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:17,619
who is actually going after this device
is we have more and more

666
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:21,319
connected by 2i had 11 connected devices
in my own home

667
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,670
I don't know about you guys but i think
thats quite a lot

668
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,989
of devices we are seeing a tax already

669
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:34,089
and it's super easy to exploit is our
abilities because they're so stupid

670
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:38,140
is so trivial even if the the previous
presenter said:

671
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,599
this is super easy to exploit is not
this not

672
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,599
ninja magic is very very simple and
maybe the most

673
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:53,219
or the most important part is that
there's no real solution for it

674
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:56,809
if you cannot update the device you
cannot

675
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:59,940
up the device what are you going to do
about it

676
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,150
I try to come up with some kind of
solution

677
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,059
but this illusions are pretty stupid
it's the same thing that will be talking

678
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:07,930
about before

679
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,059
change the default password the

680
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:15,599
try to update it if it's possible then
what what else can you do

681
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,410
the only thing that I thought of that
you can do more is maybe put it on a

682
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,239
different net for segmentation to put it
on at the lab

683
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:26,729
but if I would ask my mom to put her TV

684
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,420
on a different feel and what do you
think your reply

685
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,680
no food for you david no Swedish
meatballs

686
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,989
no no no so we don't have a solution for
it

687
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:43,809
I we as a community need to work
together to come up with a solution

688
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:46,880
and we as a security researcher
community

689
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,109
which means me and everyone else also
need to start talking about

690
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:54,579
security threats that relevant thats

691
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,950
right now not try to predict the

692
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:00,670
teacher cuz it doesn't help we need to
start fixing the security stuff

693
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,240
that we are viable against right now
today and the stuff that we have been

694
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,220
but borrow against

695
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,980
in the future my prediction is that we
will still be viable to the stuff that

696
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,430
we talked about for 30 years

697
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,550
in another 30 years because we don't
know how to do security

698
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,130
and when I was reporting all these

699
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,260
for religious to the to the vendors I'm
going to n my presentation with a small

700
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,390
image on how the reacted to me and this
is very important because if they react

701
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,410
like this to me

702
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,270
why would I ever want to submit more of
our abilities to any vendor

703
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:43,270
to dick at this picture and I thank you
so much

704
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,310
this is a response from the vendor

705
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,310
now party

706
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,020
no more presentations party
