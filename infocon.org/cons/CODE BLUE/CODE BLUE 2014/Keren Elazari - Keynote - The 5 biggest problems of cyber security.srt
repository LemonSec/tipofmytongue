1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,090
Ohio goes a mass had in the past and

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,820
very nice

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,369
fascia Candice Karen he or she gonna
guess you mad nice to meet you all

4
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,369
I'm so excited to be

5
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,840
you'll hear today it's my

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,230
second time in Tokyo and every time i
visit

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,489
I find there is incredible technology

8
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,879
innovation and people in Japan

9
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,930
so as much as I'm looking forward

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,660
to talk with you today I'm also looking
forward

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,190
to learn from you this morning as you
heard

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,120
my name is ken as I think what I would
like to

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,539
speak to you about are some of the
biggest problem

14
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:07,780
that the world faces right now

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,070
in the field of cyber security bad

16
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,250
apart from the problems I would also
like to suggest

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,259
some solutions and I would like to tell
you

18
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:24,619
why I think it is the hackers and the
security professionals

19
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,909
that might save the world someday

20
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,100
so let's get started showing

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,680
if I ask you right now

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,100
what was the single worst security
problem

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,100
or breach experience

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,170
in the past year in 2014

25
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,180
you might each have different ideas

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,450
because the past here has been dramatic

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,110
when it comes to cyber security maybe
you're thinking about

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,610
what happened at target and Home Depot

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,250
in the retail market in America when

30
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,290
where millions of credit card numbers
were stolen perhaps you're thinking

31
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,290
about something else

32
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,570
what about the game over variant

33
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,680
above the popular source middleware
which

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,360
took it to peer to peer levels maybe you
have in mind

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,799
all the problems discovered in
fundamental encryption technology

36
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,750
like SSL heart bleed

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,230
or their shell shock bash bug

38
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,510
or the for their buck have been so many
problems

39
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,920
or perhaps what you have in mind our

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,480
now the attacks on the once secure

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,260
Apple I O S ecosystem or maybe you are
thinking about a kak

42
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,040
on critical infrastructure like energy
generation

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,359
& Electric Power's perhaps you are more
concerned

44
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,470
with privacy and the invasions to
privacy that we have learned about in

45
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,669
the past year or so

46
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,689
indeed there is no doubt to the past
year has been

47
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,450
very dramatic indeed probably

48
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,590
in December what everyone is thinking
about though

49
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,689
is what happened took sony Pictures in
the United States

50
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,819
and the massive attack launched by
hackers

51
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,139
calling themselves the guardians of
peace

52
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,469
it is now rumored that

53
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,579
the attack on Sony was so hard to
recover from

54
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,639
the company's actually considering

55
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,669
to delay the publishing all

56
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,889
their movie about north korea which

57
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,919
perhaps was the reason behind this
attack so

58
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,269
a very dramatic year a year for us

59
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,379
security professionals to look at the
world

60
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,229
that we're trying to secure and realize
that

61
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,879
the problems are everywhere and I'm sure
you've heard this saying before

62
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,569
but I have many friends pool are in the
security business

63
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,310
and they like to joke they say

64
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,729
the only two types organizations out
there

65
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,599
though that have been hacked and does
but don't know it

66
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:25,389
already that mean almost every
organization

67
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,460
is kicking time bomb

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,699
with a massive attack waiting to happen

69
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,240
I just waiting to be discovered

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,600
the lesson here is that

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,370
on of everyone can be attacked and

72
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,430
if there are people that know how to get
everywhere

73
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,810
attackers they can find access into

74
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,190
any system any computer any environment

75
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,210
this is a lesson

76
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,720
I learned myself almost twenty years ago

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,420
I was a bit young and it was the year

78
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,720
1995 and I learned this lesson

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,310
from this lady maybe someone you
recognize her

80
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,810
it is the hollywood actress Angelina
Jolie

81
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,270
in the year 1995 she starred in the film

82
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,830
card hackers when I saw that movie

83
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,880
now was about 14 at the time I realized
that

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,100
Packers are people with incredible power
right in their hands they can get

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,870
everywhere

86
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,760
they can do almost anything they want
and sometimes

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,890
they can also be the heroes this is the
lesson I learned from Angelina Jolie

88
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,480
since then I've spent almost 20 years

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,860
in the security community and the
security industry

90
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,700
I've worked with organizations like

91
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,020
technology providers defense contractors

92
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,380
telecom companies consulting
organization

93
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,690
really all across the board and I

94
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,440
gether different perspectives from
working with different companies also

95
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,510
worked with the Israeli military

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,010
as you might know in israel women serve
in the army

97
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,300
next to the man and I worked with an
information security department

98
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,030
all the Israeli military I turned my
CISSP

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,640
diploma in 2007 in the past two years

100
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,820
most of my work is in the academic field
working with Singularity University

101
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,540
in California and Tel Aviv University in
this rat

102
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,810
other than that I am in industry analyst

103
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,680
working with GigaOM from California as a

104
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,410
academic researcher as an analyst what
they do is look

105
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,120
at the trends and look at the phenomena
that is happening

106
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,830
in the cybersecurity world and I try to
find a story

107
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,630
try to find the trend to understand what
is going on

108
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,199
as a storyteller I often

109
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,490
seeks to take a different perspective
think and today I'd like to offer you

110
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,840
my perspective if we look at the past
here

111
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,460
if we look at all of these attacks and
if we take a look

112
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,900
at the future what we will learn

113
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,360
what we will learn is that

114
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,889
behind the corner technologies waiting
for us

115
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,840
but we don't yet know how it will it
affect

116
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,580
our lives we don't know what are going
to be the biggest security problems

117
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,210
in 2015 because technology is changing

118
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,220
very rapidly but

119
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,780
one prediction that we can already reach

120
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,889
is that we will have big security
problems

121
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,139
so now is the time to start looking at
them maybe even

122
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:07,860
working together to solve those problems
and I reached the conclusion that we can

123
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,169
work together to solve those problems
earlier this year

124
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,400
when I was invited to speak asked

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,789
the thirtieth and one TED Conference
attend event is

126
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,639
quite unique it's a massive media

127
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,110
event that also fanned all the talk and
then they are

128
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,130
accessed online by millions of people

129
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,289
in my talk at TED I claimed

130
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,740
that one on the way to solve the
security challenges

131
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,899
in the years ahead is to take advantage

132
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,839
I'll the hacker community to work
together with the hacker community and

133
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,779
look at hackers as the immune system

134
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,290
for the information age if you think
about it

135
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,500
hackers work separately but together

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,310
they are different individual like

137
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,880
organisms yourself but they are reach

138
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,500
a similar go or be fine security
problems and whether the report on the

139
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,240
problem disclose the problem

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,200
or try to exploit it we all learn about
it

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,510
and then we get better this is

142
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,810
part of how the evolution of technology
works in fact

143
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,130
so today I'd like to think about this

144
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,040
immune system analogy and

145
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,450
suggest that actually we can all be part

146
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,990
on this immune system we can all work
together

147
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,360
hackers and security professionals and
industry vendors

148
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,870
but that's not enough we have

149
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,200
to act now now is the time

150
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
to move forward and the reason for that

151
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,410
is because the security challenges I
waiting to happen

152
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,490
the right around the corner and some of
them have been devastating

153
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,510
in the past few or no so

154
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,170
really can't take the risk of letting
more

155
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,250
security breaches like that happen in
the next few years

156
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,360
and not do anything about it so

157
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,930
today I'm offering to you a choice
between

158
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,130
doing something about it and not doing
something about

159
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,910
and in order to convince you

160
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,650
to make the choice to act now

161
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:32,180
i weird talk about 5 above the biggest
security problems but also find all the

162
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,940
things that we can all do

163
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,910
as security professionals to save the
world now I'd like to start with what is

164
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,450
perhaps

165
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,360
the biggest problem of the mall and that
is

166
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,520
that they are not just talking about
securing

167
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,500
the world Wide Web for not just talking
about securing

168
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,470
the intern

169
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,579
I like to talk about securing cyberspace

170
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,190
now that sounds like a big name right

171
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,470
I'm sure you are familiar with the term
cyber

172
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,019
you've heard it before some security
professionals

173
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,589
even say that cyber is a a

174
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,620
marketing word or that it is

175
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,860
a stinging for the Internet I'd like to
suggest that cyberspace

176
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,269
is even greater than that and let's go
back in history and understand

177
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,930
where fiber comes from this gentleman

178
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,010
is an American math professor

179
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,589
or at least he was his name is Norbert
Wiener

180
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,269
and in 1948 professor Norbert Wiener

181
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:50,029
invented a new scientific discipline he
was looking at how technology is

182
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:50,730
changing

183
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,490
how remote command and communication
technologies

184
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,570
are transforming the well henny

185
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,699
was looking for a name to

186
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:05,170
give this new authentic discipline
describing

187
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,019
the transformative nature of new
technologies

188
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,620
like remote command in controller
technologies

189
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,510
so in order to come up with a name yeah
actually borrowed from someone else and

190
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,220
I will show you

191
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,240
from forming a in a minute this is his
book from 1948

192
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,640
cybernetics control and communication in
the animal in the machine

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,000
it it was published more than sixty
years ago

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,290
but they think it's more than relevant
today in the 21st century

195
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,529
when we actually have a mold

196
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,709
command control communications
everywhere when Norbert Wiener was

197
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:45,779
looking for a name

198
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,680
for this discipline cybernetics he
actually got his inspiration

199
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,000
from this guy this is the captain

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the manhole runs the boat and the
ancient Greeks who were a

201
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,570
empire in their 50

202
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,270
city state Empire in the Mediterranean
Sea had a very powerful

203
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,920
Armada and its each ship

204
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,090
had a captain the captain of the ship

205
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,550
is the guy who says where when how fast
and in which direction

206
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,100
will be shipped today this man is called

207
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,010
in Greek key bill met and from the Greek

208
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,730
keep let us professor winner invented

209
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,529
cybernetics but I don't think

210
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,910
that he realized quite how relevant
remote

211
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,640
command and controller communication
technologies

212
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,600
are going to be I don't know if
professor winner if

213
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,430
even imagine that one day humanity

214
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,690
will have robot on mars

215
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,050
running around communicating back to
earth

216
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,339
and even writing on Twitter about it

217
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,630
so today we have

218
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,660
these types of technologies everywhere
and

219
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,910
cyberspace is also on March

220
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,410
by the way can you guess

221
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,400
what is the most popular language in the
galaxy

222
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,890
any ideas last week I

223
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,050
gave a speech in Belgium and one of the
suggestions was

224
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,130
cling on but actually

225
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,220
the language the popular most popular
language in the galaxy is not cling on

226
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,190
it is in fact job

227
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,560
yes it's true there are billions

228
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,130
all devices that I running Java
including

229
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,130
the mars rover the robot

230
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,650
running around on March and these are
devices

231
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,790
not just computers all web servers

232
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,510
our databases this can be anything from

233
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,540
eckhard to ATM's

234
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,160
to smart watches now I think

235
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,980
today in this conference we will learn
about how

236
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,510
some of these devices like smart homes
and cars

237
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,540
are going to be hacked in the near
future

238
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,580
so in the past

239
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,440
25 here this has been the story

240
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,240
of cybersecurity these are the top 10

241
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,760
computing and software environment in
which most

242
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,310
vulnerabilities were found in the past
25 years

243
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,230
but if we look at the future

244
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,190
this is going to be the story of
cybersecurity

245
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,410
it is going to be remote command and
communication technologies

246
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,830
it's going to be satellites and radio
frequency

247
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,480
and location information GPS

248
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,610
and fifth innings for running

249
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,180
airplanes in the sky and ships in the
ocean all this stuff

250
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,480
is going to be part of cybersecurity so

251
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,940
the same technologies that lol a group
of hackers from

252
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,360
the University of Texas to

253
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,990
transmit a farce location filming at
force

254
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,200
GPS signal to a superyacht

255
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,330
and make it go of course this is part of
cybersecurity

256
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,840
and standing radio signals

257
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,750
to embedded insulin pump that save the
lives of

258
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,240
that big patient but can also hack

259
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,030
their body

260
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,360
and transmit too much in Swat inserting
into the blood this is also part of

261
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,400
cybersecurity

262
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,040
and hacking into satellite part of
cyberspace

263
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,600
a problem for cybersecurity and

264
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,820
something local perhaps hacking into a

265
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,580
Real Talk enable toilet yes

266
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:13,240
it's also problem for cybersecurity so
how can we face this big problem

267
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,270
it's not just about the Internet it's
not just the what about the World Wide

268
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,670
Web

269
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,260
cyberspace is a lot bigger than that
it's all the different technologies

270
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,330
any solutions maybe we can join

271
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,710
the Amish which is a a group or
religious and Christians in the united

272
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,420
states that do not believe in the use of
technology

273
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,010
I heard last summer that they already
have smart phones

274
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,690
so maybe that's not the best solution as
well

275
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,350
we have to secure

276
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,670
all of the things all these different
things

277
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,620
and these are so many different
technology environment

278
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,290
and I haven't even mentioned the new

279
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:04,690
when Giants the companies that are going
to probably have some of the most fun

280
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,440
abilities

281
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,050
for the next 25 years so perhaps

282
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,380
the first step the first big problem

283
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,880
but also the first step is to realize
that cybersecurity

284
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,930
is about all of these

285
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,800
different environments all these
together

286
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,450
it's the technology that we used in the
past 25 years and the technology that we

287
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,350
will use in the next 25 years

288
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,980
it is the web giants that have all our
information and I'll web services

289
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,580
but also the fundamental technologies
like

290
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,640
open SSL and passion and then

291
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,120
infrastructure that we all use every day
all this together

292
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,350
is part of the problem

293
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,170
for cyberspace so if it's all one big

294
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,630
ecosystem and by the way this isn't

295
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,090
image of the Internet and connected
devices

296
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,070
from a few years ago right now it's even
more

297
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,430
complex and more connected so if it's
all connected

298
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,220
then we can all be part of the pinion
50m we can all work together

299
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,360
to solve problems so that was

300
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,190
problem number one cyberspace complex
but it's all connected

301
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,870
and we can work to solve those problems
that

302
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,010
problem number two this space

303
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,000
the cyberspace is fitted with very
creative

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,240
penny very innovative in very
collaborative

305
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,850
bad guys criminals

306
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,170
spies malicious attackers

307
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,350
they are very smart

308
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,510
and a don't mind working together they
share information

309
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,870
the share attack techniques and they
keep inventing

310
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,270
new things every day every day there is
a new

311
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,420
exploit or in your problem and to do
whatever they want

312
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,630
to get what they want if it's your money
or your document

313
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,550
or stopping the publication of annual

314
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:18,760
Sony Pictures movie them do anything in
the past year we've seen

315
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,780
tremendous innovation in the cyber
criminal underground

316
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,690
one example is the peer to peer variant

317
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,870
I'll the source matter where if you can
raise your hand and tell me

318
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,240
who here has heard about Zeus it's
probably the most popular

319
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,840
matter where in the planet right and it
has many variants

320
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,820
fence its source code was published a
few years ago

321
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,220
many other criminals have taken the
source code

322
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,470
and created better new versions of it

323
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,490
so they're not afraid to collaborate and

324
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,510
share tours between them and another big
problem we've seen in the past year

325
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,510
are crypto lockers crypto lockers are

326
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,360
or new types of malware perhaps ordered

327
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,580
new types of malware get encrypt

328
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,860
the hard drive all the computers the in
fact

329
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,730
and then request money around some

330
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,770
to release the five this is also called

331
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,700
ran some software around somewhere and

332
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,250
arising problem in the criminal
underworld

333
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,700
another innovative technique that
criminals use to get

334
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,700
your money or to infect your PC is Matt
advertising

335
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,110
now advertising is the combination I'll

336
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,340
malicious and advertising and there are
so many

337
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,590
ads and banners like this on the
internet that masquerade as legitimate

338
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,130
add sometimes they can if

339
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,850
appear on the front page of the New York
Times or the Yahoo homepage

340
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,620
but once you click them the matter where
gets

341
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,770
dropped downloaded to your machine and
your device is infected

342
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,550
in fact in a recent survey

343
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,660
Cisco claimed that people are

344
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,680
110 82 times more

345
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,560
likely to get infected by clicking

346
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,270
on one of these militia sad then by
visiting and

347
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,310
adult content website so it's very
dangerous to surf online

348
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:36,200
even in a very innocent website like
Yahoo homepage organ work time

349
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,860
and there is a new problem as well

350
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,000
fake anti-virus program

351
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,860
you know not just add these are adds
that make

352
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,510
the users think they need to install
this

353
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,690
anti-virus program which then actually
installers virus

354
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:01,700
these are just a few examples of how
innovative companies have

355
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,800
have become using the security industry

356
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,700
against it of course we are now learning
about

357
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,480
malicious software for smartphones there
are many variants of that as well

358
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,809
and one of the newest to additions to
the past year 2014

359
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,470
point-of-sale matter where matter where
which

360
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,360
620 back the point of state saying the
cash registers

361
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,429
at places like target or Home Depot

362
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:34,049
or other popular retail locations and
grab the credit card numbers

363
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:39,440
directly from there what all these
examples show up

364
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,049
is that the bad guys no the name of the
game

365
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,179
in the name of the game is to innovate
and

366
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,120
automate and create new technique in new
growth

367
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,570
revenue engine all the time they are not
resting

368
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,690
maybe they have conferences like this to
learn from each other

369
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,760
but they're not taking a day off from
working hard

370
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,040
to steel our money so

371
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,870
this is the second problem what could be
the solution

372
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,290
one approach could be to keep calm

373
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,740
and carry on and some security vendors
have suggested

374
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,710
that cybercrime is parts of the world in
which would accept it

375
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,799
I don't agree and maybe we can do
something different

376
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,690
maybe we can do the same thing that the
criminals are doing

377
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,110
share collaborate and innovate

378
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,780
work together to learn

379
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,240
about these new techniques and figure
out new wave

380
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,150
to protect against them collaboration
and information sharing programs

381
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,910
already showing great promise all over
the world

382
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,900
I heard that there are some initial
information sharing programs

383
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,179
in Japan as well I'm a big fan all

384
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,620
the practice on sharing details I'll the
attacks

385
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,520
the intelligence that together and I
think

386
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,610
it's time to share it's time to open up
in

387
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,049
tell everyone what has happened even
though many organizations

388
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:20,070
are embarrassed to say that they were
attacked

389
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,940
the reality of 2014

390
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,130
as we've seen is that almost any
organization can be a target

391
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,510
so really there's not much to be ashamed
about is there

392
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,790
any one one saying is that

393
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,990
sharing is carrying and by sharing
information you're caring for

394
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,080
the ecosystem that you share with your
friends

395
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,300
but I I hear from any security
professionals in many organizations

396
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,820
that they don't care about other ppl

397
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,520
they would just like to protect their
own environment

398
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,410
their own enterprise their own computing
systems their own laser

399
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,790
piece of heaven as it were and make sure
that they're safe

400
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,450
and it doesn't matter what happens to
everyone that so

401
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,890
wiring should you care why should

402
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,780
anyone care this brings me to the

403
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,700
third big problem it's not just about

404
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,410
cybercriminals anymore in the past year

405
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:30,310
we've learned that they are massive
resources human resources hard at work

406
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:34,840
actually making the world honorable
keeping the world

407
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,990
fun about making it less safe for
everyone else it's not just the federal

408
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,590
criminal in the past year

409
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,850
we've learned that certain government
agencies

410
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,060
have spent millions of dollars on
finding new

411
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,920
software vulnerabilities but not so they
can fix the vulnerabilities

412
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,080
but rather sort they can exploit them

413
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,800
we've heard about and weak

414
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,540
crypto algorithm that was deliberately

415
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,270
kept week for ten years and them

416
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,620
varying well known company refused vast
amount of money

417
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:20,170
to keep this algorithm everywhere

418
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,210
although it was weak or

419
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,390
the heart bleed open if the Fed about
when

420
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,050
everyone learned about heart bleed
buggin open SSL

421
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,280
in April

422
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,220
this year it was considered a massive
problem

423
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,470
but the reality is that a certain
government agency

424
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,740
had known about it for years and

425
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,890
everybody uses SSL every country every
organization uses SSL

426
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,320
so this organization this agency

427
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,500
chose to keep it fun about instead of

428
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,650
fixing it for the whole world but

429
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,680
there is something that really makes my
heart believe

430
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,150
at work and these are front page
articles like this

431
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,610
published in time magazine earlier this
year

432
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:20,380
this article record World War zero talks
about a new trade

433
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,310
in software vulnerabilities they are
private companies that

434
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,160
develop new all software vulnerabilities
also known as

435
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,330
zero-day vulnerabilities and the weapon
knife them

436
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,990
they create working exploit and then

437
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:41,070
seldom to the highest bidder so that
means there is a

438
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,120
small group I'll individuals and
companies making

439
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,760
lot of money by making everyone else fun

440
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,060
and this is part all the big

441
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,220
problems that we have to face there are
massive resources

442
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,980
at work to make companies like that and
government agency like I mentioned

443
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,580
keep finding new vulnerabilities in your
problems

444
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,720
and they're doing their job that's what
they want to do

445
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,850
that means we all have to work

446
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,850
much harder so I'd like to suggest the
solution to that

447
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,620
or one solution to that and my solution
would be

448
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,120
don't keep your bugs to herself very
simple

449
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,520
the more unknown software
vulnerabilities

450
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,620
are kept silent and secret everyone else
remains

451
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,540
in secure if you are a security
researcher

452
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,320
or malware researcher or even a security
professional in Oregon

453
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,060
nation and you find the problem you find
a bug you find the viability

454
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,360
I think that the best approach

455
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,580
is to make it public and no I think

456
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,430
there is a saying from a supreme

457
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,350
court judge in the United States me said
this about a hundred years ago

458
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,710
he claimed that there is no better

459
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,970
these infect and then the light of day
and

460
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,090
I think this also holds true for when it
comes to

461
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,840
software vulnerabilities next like these
on the Japanese version

462
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,140
thank you

463
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,390
perfect the light of day

464
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,010
so by making

465
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,700
the bugs and vulnerability that we find

466
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,990
known to the public we can make

467
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,070
companies fix their technology and we
can all become more secure

468
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,190
think about the immune system

469
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,080
analogy if we keep a lot of viruses

470
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,530
secret how can we develop a solution how
can the immune system becomes stronger

471
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,840
and protect against it we have to
publish

472
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,990
security vulnerabilities and bug one
from tastic way to get more bugs found

473
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,310
our bug bounty program I heard that

474
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,430
bug bounty programs are starting to

475
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,180
come up in Japan you might have one or
two like this but they're still not very

476
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,900
popular

477
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,330
I think the bug bounty programs are
fantastic ways

478
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,420
to get more security vulnerabilities
found one popular program is the

479
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,150
Facebook

480
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,910
bug bounty program these programs are

481
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:32,220
away for a company like Facebook to pay
independent hackers and security

482
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,400
researchers

483
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,260
rewards for disclosing vulnerabilities

484
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,430
in their cold and it's not just Facebook
was doing it

485
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,920
in fact there are more than a hundred
companies

486
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,290
in Silicon Valley that now have
published

487
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,250
bug bounty program and they've paid more
than million

488
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,080
millions of dollars for security
researchers from all over the world

489
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,640
Facebook say that they've paid about to

490
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,780
to three million dollars just in their
own bug bounty program

491
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,559
it's a fantastic way to get more
vulnerabilities found

492
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,010
harness the power of the builder hacker
community

493
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,270
and reward them for their findings
another great bounty program is the

494
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,090
internet

495
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,360
by the bounty plan this was started by a
company called

496
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,570
hacker want and their idea was that some
technologies

497
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,169
like PHP and Perl and open SSL

498
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:31,750
our technology that we all rely on you

499
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,030
but there's nobody working to secure
them

500
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,650
and find the problem so by coming up
with a budget

501
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,630
for a reward program a bug bounty
program for these technologies

502
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,570
they are making cyberspace safer for
everyone

503
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,280
and this is a and

504
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,929
image from Japanese publication and I'm
not sure I got the joke of it but I

505
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:58,980
understand that bug bounty programs are
beginning

506
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,340
and their way in Japan in the past year
and

507
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,230
I'm very positive about it but I think
there is great promise but

508
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,830
saying you don't find bugs let's say
you're not going to security research

509
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,669
and you don't discovered by the by
yourself okay what about

510
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:20,740
exploits maybe you found in you exploit

511
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,080
one thing to do about it is to

512
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,200
uploaded could be exploit that the base
and if your company or an organization

513
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,140
that develops technology

514
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,350
I would suggest you take a look at the
extra database

515
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,970
you might be surprised to find some
exploit against

516
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,809
your own technology there this would
happen to me many times

517
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:49,490
where I go to consult or speak with big
software companies and ask them okay

518
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,679
what the situation with exploiting
vulnerabilities

519
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,330
in your cold and they say oh we're
secure we don't have any exploits

520
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,590
in the wild

521
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:04,970
north and abilities but if you go online
to a database like this or the

522
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,140
open-source fun ability database

523
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,690
and you type in the company name or the
technology product name

524
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,280
the software suite you find many bugs
are still

525
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,690
being exploited after technology and
they didn't even know about

526
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,179
so one way is to look in these databases

527
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,649
exploit database and the open source
community database

528
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:32,089
and you might find your technology or
software that you use

529
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:36,099
is already listed there but

530
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,330
let's say you don't find security
vulnerabilities or exploit okay

531
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,190
what about no matter where what about
you

532
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,399
fun that you discovered on your system

533
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,639
and you suspect that it might be
malicious what do you do that

534
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,510
probably you try to research it yourself
for youth and it will allow

535
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,810
but another approach could be too
uploaded

536
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,770
tocqueville start out how many have you
here are familiar with this

537
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,780
cell website we also got over here

538
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,000
view not fantastic many many viewers

539
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,700
now in use this product by the way it's
a service offered

540
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,230
for free sense Google acquired

541
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,130
the website and they are running it and
in this website you can upload

542
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,510
suspected 5 and have it tested

543
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,849
with more than 50 different anti-matter
engines

544
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:33,630
but even if it is not discovered that
suspicious file

545
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,330
it is then sent on words to other
security vendors

546
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,420
to start developing the signatures for
it

547
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,820
to start identifying it so again think
about an immune system

548
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,260
we all shared information and

549
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,200
we can create new signatures again new
manner at the score some love you all

550
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,250
are perhaps not on the bottom or not
exploitable

551
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:03,339
in the world Taylor Swift well actually
they should not be popular American

552
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:03,940
finger

553
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,200
Taylor Swift bats day

554
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,800
Twitter parody account called swift on
security

555
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,360
and the reason I mention this is because
again

556
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,250
even at this stage there are some
organizations and some companies to

557
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,790
think

558
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,720
we're not a problem we are secure there
are no vulnerabilities in our product

559
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,010
we are safe well that brings me

560
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,680
24 big problem we are all

561
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,550
as mine about as our weakest link

562
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,780
no organization or person

563
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,980
in the 21st century is an island

564
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,010
we are relying on services technology
solutions

565
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,830
partners we have customers we have
calling

566
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,470
we work with other technology systems
were part of an ecosystem

567
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,480
nobody is isolated and that means that

568
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,869
even if for instance you are a massive
american company like Target

569
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:08,130
even if you're a company that invests
very heavily

570
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,330
in cybersecurity target had them

571
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,290
budget for security more than one
million dollars some of the most

572
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,250
innovative new technologies a place yet

573
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,810
it was still hack how is this possible
well the reason

574
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,420
is because this organization was hacked
first

575
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,730
this organization is called Fuzzy 0
Mechanical Services

576
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,390
and I wouldn't be surprised if you've
never heard about them

577
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,250
because this is a small company from
pennsylvania

578
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,250
that hander refrigerator

579
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,410
macon and this was the

580
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,580
refrigerator maintenance Supplier for

581
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,000
target the massive American retailer

582
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,240
and while target invests very heavily

583
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,140
in cybersecurity fazio Mechanical
Services

584
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,020
do not and fun so did not even have

585
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,580
basic antivirus in place so the
attackers who wanted to get into target

586
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,450
first act Fazil an easy target

587
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:16,640
and as a supplier of target Fazil had
axis

588
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,420
to the target supplier portal from there

589
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,420
the hackers were able to get into the
Active Directory

590
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,010
inside target and that was there

591
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,069
first pointing to the organization from
there they were able to

592
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:35,210
getting to the point of sale systems and
stealing millions of credit card

593
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,339
but it all started with one refrigerator
company

594
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,809
in pennsylvania that doesn't even have a
basic anti-virus

595
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:46,069
we are all as weak as our weakest

596
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:49,549
partner even a massive

597
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:52,740
defense company like Lockheed Martin

598
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,099
who creates the next generation fighter
jet

599
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:59,260
the F 35 bomber fighter

600
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,730
even they are as weak as their

601
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,279
weakest partner and in this case one of
the reasons

602
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,839
1-under suggested reasons that Lockheed
Martin

603
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:16,069
was hacked and 2011 was because their
security provider

604
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:19,599
in this case our essay what hack

605
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,069
lockheed-martin used the ISA

606
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:27,710
secure ID one-time password token which
meant they have

607
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,440
pretty strong authentication so the
attackers

608
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,900
first got into arce to get the secret
information and the algorithm

609
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,940
the generated this one-time password

610
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,670
token now who is behind this attack

611
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,660
there are many rumors but I think

612
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,960
one image is worth a thousand words this
is data

613
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,960
J 22 mother from Chengdu China I think
you'll find it looks quite similar

614
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,710
to the f35 mother made by Lockheed
Martin

615
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,850
so

616
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,810
like I said we are all on me as week as
our

617
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,120
weakest part and sometimes even if

618
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,680
our partner is a multi-billion-dollar
security company

619
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,090
we will still get hacked so it might be

620
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:28,320
a matter of time even if your
organization has not been attacked

621
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,270
it might be your partner your customers

622
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,630
your employees getting attacked at home

623
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,700
and the second

624
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,560
part of this problem is we have

625
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,280
an illusion we think our borders are
being defended

626
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,960
by fierce cyber warriors but the reality
is

627
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,530
there are no borders in cyberspace

628
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,270
everybody is on the front line

629
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:05,820
member well-connected so we don't really
have these

630
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,020
fears cyber warriors defending us its

631
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,530
each and every one of us who is or needs
to be

632
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,950
that warrior on the front line we are
connected

633
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,980
this image is up

634
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,250
from the Gulf click also known as DNS
Changer

635
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,370
not or infection a few years ago

636
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,940
now this was a a Trojan used

637
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,890
mostly for clickjacking and other types
of

638
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,210
cybercrime however this image all

639
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,350
almost four million infected devices

640
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,230
shows a very clear picture the attackers

641
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,690
didn't care where the computers the
infected war

642
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,890
they didn't care if it was a security
organization

643
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,470
or a smaller company even after

644
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,190
the American space agency had infected
divisive

645
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,410
what this means is that

646
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:08,230
if your machine is infected than you are

647
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:13,860
part of the problem you're spreading the
infection onward

648
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,680
think about the immune system analogy so
if you are not part of the solution

649
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,580
if you're not part of the immune system
you are probably going to be part of the

650
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,100
problem

651
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,200
so another suggestion of another
suggestion on the way

652
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,400
to solve it there are many people out
there

653
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,140
are very happy the massive people that
use their computer or their smartphone

654
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,840
everyday

655
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,530
and they're not concerned with
cybersecurity

656
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,290
they don't realize that they are a part
of the problem

657
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,400
so we have to empower them

658
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,960
we have to help them become part of the
solution

659
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,100
in a way I think we would like all those

660
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,730
happy people to be more like us like
security professionals

661
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,140
always thinking about the next thread
always thinking about security

662
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,890
challenges

663
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,000
always trying to stay one head all the
attacker one

664
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,550
step ahead of the attacker 11 to do this

665
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,570
is a called crypto parties these are
very popular event in Europe

666
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,310
and a crypto party is a voluntary event
informal

667
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,710
like a party where security
professionals

668
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,850
teach basic security scares

669
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,840
to everyday people they teach them about
photography

670
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,250
about staying safe and private online
and they make them

671
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:44,210
a little bit more powerful there is
another way to empower the masses

672
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,970
and their actually there is someone in
the audience

673
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:53,260
who has participated in one of these in
the past this is called a

674
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,220
red cyber team and this is in no way an
experiment

675
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,840
started by a good friend of mine was
actually sitting here in the front row

676
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,420
and he will speak to you later

677
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,450
his name using bomb so a group of
security professionals from tel aviv

678
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,710
came together as volunteers

679
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,990
to perform voluntary

680
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,000
red King security testing

681
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,530
for an organization that did not

682
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,350
that could not afford it

683
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:28,400
and did not really have security in mind
in bar is it okay if I say that type of

684
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,430
organization

685
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,370
the type yes but nothing okay so this
organization

686
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,770
is a medical environment hospital

687
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:42,400
in central Israel and didn't have any
security budget in place

688
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,550
but after the Red team came with their

689
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,480
quite happy and performed very basic

690
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,970
and free security assessment showing the
hospital manager

691
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,110
exactly what they could do that growth
security

692
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,910
to the top of them I'm it brought
cybersecurity

693
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,900
into the agenda for that organization so
as security professionals

694
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,990
that's another way you can help the
masses

695
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,200
help them empower them make them safer
work like an immune system

696
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,300
volunteer to perform assessments like
that

697
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,760
for organizations that are not from a Dr

698
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,490
with cyber security or that don't invest
in it in other ways by organizing

699
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,580
what is sometimes called a cyber

700
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,660
fire engine this is like and

701
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,060
earthquake parent nest test or fire
drill

702
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,160
where you make everyone in the
organization get ready

703
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,870
for dealing with an attack scenario how
do you know that something went wrong

704
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,970
what are the first indicators what is
the first response

705
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,390
how to deal with an emergency situation

706
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,250
in cyberspace I learned

707
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:05,000
left week that the fiftieth San Diego in
the United States is performing cyber

708
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,410
drills and exercises

709
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,900
for businesses in California as a joint

710
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,390
voluntary venture with the naval

711
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:17,750
Postgraduate School which is the
University belonging to the American

712
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,130
Navy

713
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:23,070
so I by this point I told you about four

714
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,470
big problems before we move on to that
last big problem

715
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:31,100
I want to give you an idea or suggestion
opportunity

716
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,200
to get some bonus points

717
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,410
in our attempt to saw all the problems
according to a recent survey Cisco they

718
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:40,790
are

719
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,620
one million security professionals
needed

720
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,560
in the world right now that means that
we need

721
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,290
1 million more security professionals
and so

722
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,720
for us as hackers a security researchers
is

723
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,310
security professionals that means we
have two

724
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,480
start creating more security
professionals

725
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,200
we have to reach out to score the
University

726
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,810
to be mentors or start under

727
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,340
internship programs for new security
professionals

728
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,910
why should we care about this

729
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,960
weekend we can just you know

730
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,800
move on as we were and not think about
creating more security professionals

731
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,320
the market which still demand 1,000,000
security professionals

732
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,730
so everybody can become a security
professional

733
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,480
but they won't have the kid and the
knowledge

734
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,180
and the quantification that Tweedy would
like them to have

735
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,190
so that should be a good reason to start
thinking about

736
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,370
making more security professionals right
now

737
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,440
and now I'd like to move on to their

738
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,200
fifth and final problem 15 find a big
problem

739
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,850
as it were for cybersecurity and I call
this problem

740
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:06,240
the gap not because of the clothing
store

741
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,120
but because of the gap between their

742
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,450
security industry us here in this room
security professionals and hackers

743
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:18,230
and the rest of the world and

744
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,610
until the real Taylor Swift

745
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:26,080
suggest that we start talking about
information security

746
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,730
we were still have a gap a gap between

747
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:34,660
the popular opinion about cybersecurity
and what we as professionals

748
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,660
no is the reality of it so the first

749
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,920
way to deal with this problem is of
course

750
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,319
to mind the gap to understand

751
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:49,200
there is this difference between how we
see security issues

752
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,190
and how the public sees security issues
and how the media

753
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:57,430
talks about them many times that when I
speak to media

754
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,150
our when I a consultant or do speaking
engagements

755
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,670
this is the a beer that the public as

756
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:10,190
you know cyberattacks there are millions
of cyberattacks

757
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,559
everybody is under millions of
cyberattacks

758
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:17,430
each day and I liked last them millions
of what

759
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,619
what are you counting millions all

760
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:23,930
port scans millions all new

761
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,619
malware variants millions of infected
PCs

762
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:31,000
it's very important to bring the
conversation

763
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,839
to the level of reality and one way to
do it is by asking

764
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,140
questions like that and again remember
the immune system analogy

765
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,220
if we're talking about bacteria

766
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,490
and viruses it's very easy to counts one
million

767
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:51,539
organisms and bacteria that may be
living everywhere

768
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:54,670
yet not everyone gets sick all the time

769
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:00,569
so keep this in mind when you're told
there are millions of cyberattacks

770
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:05,319
bring the conversation to reality mind
the gap between

771
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:08,640
what we know is happening and what the
attacks are

772
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,210
and what the public thinks about it and

773
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,880
there is also a gap between I for
security professionals

774
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,049
and the top management the executive

775
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:23,480
leading organizations that we're working
with and we want to make them invest

776
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,849
more in cybersecurity

777
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:28,849
but we don't know how well here's

778
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:32,559
one way to do it you can ask the
question

779
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,079
very simple question how much does the
organization

780
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,450
spend on coffee each year if you're
spending more on coffee

781
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:48,470
then on cybersecurity you're going to
have a problem

782
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,360
now this was a suggestion by Richard
Clark

783
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,520
who was a their former White House

784
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,620
chief cyber security officer for

785
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,490
the a bush government Bush
administration ten years ago

786
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,550
but it's still true there are some
organizations

787
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:09,070
and some management executives that are
more concerned with the coffee budget

788
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:13,540
then with making sure the organization
is secure so

789
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,410
we have to mind that gap and we have to
start closing that gap

790
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,530
now as I up

791
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,770
reflect on the think that and cordial

792
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:29,630
let's give it a moment to look at these
big problems some of these are very

793
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,930
serious major problems but here are the
good news

794
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:38,890
all these that these issues these things
I think that we can all

795
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,180
change we can do something about

796
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:47,210
right now some people in their
organization or environment

797
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,800
what did they say I would love to change
the world

798
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,510
but they don't give me access to the
source called

799
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:58,310
well here is the thing when it comes to

800
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:03,330
these problems and solving them for the
future I talked about buying things

801
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:09,180
that we can order the right now and we
don't need access to the source code on

802
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,740
the world

803
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,650
we can start making these changes happen
in our organizations

804
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,060
so let's summarize number one

805
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,570
think about securing cyberspace

806
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,910
not just the internet or

807
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,630
the World Wide Web cyberspace is complex
and it has many different technologies

808
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,110
in it

809
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:33,800
number two the bad guys are
collaborative

810
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,230
so we should be as collaborative share
information

811
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,230
innovating our defense techniques and
work together

812
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:47,690
number three don't keep your bike

813
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,780
yourself there is no better disinfectant
then the light of day

814
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,810
reports on vulnerabilities

815
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,920
disclose exploits start about the bounty
program

816
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,190
in your organization or contribute to
another program

817
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:09,140
this is all things that you can do
number four

818
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:14,480
they are amassed masses out there happy
shiny people

819
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,970
that don't think they are part of the
problem we have to make them powerful

820
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,780
we have to help them defend themselves
bring them

821
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:27,530
into our world the cybersecurity world
problem number five

822
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:30,690
there is a gap the gap between

823
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,600
the security industry and the general
public and the gap between

824
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,700
ass and our managers and by

825
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,690
finding this gap identifying it and
trying to bridge

826
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,190
across it weekend make cyberspace

827
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,960
safer so with that

828
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,600
I'd like to give you one last message

829
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,740
the future is already here 2015 is
around the corner

830
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:04,410
new attacks no wonder abilities new
technologies and your problems

831
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,610
will be discovered the question is

832
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,760
how will you shows to protect it

833
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:17,760
thank you

834
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,150
carnahan do we have a time for one
question yes

835
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,650
okay if you have any questions believe

836
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,660
stand up there's a question over here

837
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,210
thank you you can ask the question in
Japanese and I would have a translated

838
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:35,740
to me

839
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:40,280
if that's better for you thank you for
does a view of the thinking about a

840
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,000
question or maybe are shy

841
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,650
plane do not hesitate to contact me on
my own personal

842
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:50,510
a.m. website on

843
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,900
yes you have it over there

844
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,380
and you have it right here my website
and my Twitter

845
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,710
so you can contact me there yesterday's
are ya today on my question is are

846
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,890
regarding yes right

847
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:07,110
saying there 1 million secured ex parte
is required

848
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:11,560
yes and do you think they are are the
requirement can be

849
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,030
it appeared by having the mom 100 them

850
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,070
by have a hundred me on our people

851
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,130
to spent a cybersecurity

852
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,790
are with out there are

853
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,180
one part and doctor brought forth and
time the other thing

854
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,300
so repeat the question just to make sure
I understood that the question was

855
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,660
if we need one million

856
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:41,860
more security professionals perhaps one
way to achieve that is by asking

857
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,150
or getting $100 million people from the
general task force

858
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,520
to focus on security and get one percent
on that

859
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,820
to make them into security professionals
yes it is so

860
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,650
I think that's a great approach that's a
great way to think about it

861
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:00,890
really if you have a big workforce which
has

862
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:06,020
hundreds of the hundreds of millions of
people all you need is that one percent

863
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,000
to become concerned about security the
other

864
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,300
part of that is there is a
responsibility for us

865
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,760
for us as people that are already in the
business

866
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,010
of cybersecurity to make sure good we r

867
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,620
actively creating more security people

868
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,760
by becoming mentors or by opening up

869
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,470
and internship program I've been in the
security industry

870
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,900
the for quite some time and in the early
days

871
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,900
I found it to be closed club

872
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:46,119
exclusive club right and maybe that was
cool in the nineties

873
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,590
but now I think in order to

874
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,680
face the challenges that we have ahead

875
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,290
we have to open up the club to more
people thank you for the question

876
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:00,609
I think and I totally agree with that
dumb security people

877
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:03,640
have to ok the crap yet gone

878
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,710
thank you and I think only have one
question here

879
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:14,710
up front pay

880
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,170
help how he's disclosing all the books

881
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,000
a solution when there is a fundamental
economic problem

882
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,570
which is a price movements became what
the bad guys

883
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:37,050
are offering and what but my aunties are
offering

884
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,210
minute because again say okay it's
working

885
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,410
the but my desire giving results but

886
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,210
a my opinion you are just getting that
top of that ice word

887
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,310
and you are not going to reach there

888
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:53,850
bottom of the iceberg where the real
stuff is that okay

889
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,740
few days that will compromise or
organization will come from thats

890
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,890
and

891
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:02,990
from that area so it's the problem okay
so let me repeat the question the

892
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:03,810
question was

893
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,700
what is the logic or the viability

894
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,760
all solving the problem of security
vulnerabilities by

895
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,310
disclosing all the bugs and by creating
about the program

896
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:19,990
where in fact the the person is claiming

897
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,140
the real problems and refund abilities
are the ones

898
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,550
probably coming from deeper underground

899
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,550
the ones that the criminals are paying a

900
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,740
bigger amount of money for if I
understand your question correctly

901
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,380
so again I think there is a question all

902
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,340
large numbers here if we can get more

903
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,010
and more and more vulnerabilities found
and discovered

904
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:50,040
and Saul it would make the life all
those people that are trying to find a

905
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,270
10 days in Feb for a lot of money

906
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:55,980
it will make their life harder and they
will have to work

907
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,580
harder to find a favorability this is

908
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,630
to you that energy it is a big swap

909
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,260
right and we can't drain it all but we
can start

910
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,170
making it a little bit more shallow we
can make the problem space

911
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,170
smaller so that they have to work harder

912
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:18,100
if they're if the criminals or the
vulnerability researchers are going to

913
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,600
make

914
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,120
200 thousand dollars for selling one bug

915
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,830
they better work hard for it that's not
make their life

916
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:29,620
easy and again it's a big problem but
one-way

917
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,820
I think to start solving a problem is by
getting more and more

918
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,560
and more vulnerability disclosed thanks
further questions very

919
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,780
relevant I think that's all we have time
for I

920
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,390
am

921
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:45,990
in

922
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,530
any more questions last question okay so
I repeat again

923
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:52,750
if you'd like to ask me a question in
private please don't hesitate to reach

924
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,030
me through my website

925
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:58,820
or my Twitter account very accessible
and I'd like to thank you again

926
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,050
oh yeah
