1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,620
hello I am I David Seidman

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,040
and I work for Microsoft in the
Microsoft Security Response Center

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,040
I I manage a number of different
programs

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,349
and among them is the Microsoft
vulnerability research program that I'm

5
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,750
going to talk about today

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,820
I note that I like

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,960
a I like doing of indication that I have
a project that I'm working on

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,480
doubt you replace passwords that

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,030
you may have seen some things about but
we also have a number of initiatives

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,910
that are happening through my group

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,350
at my Co presenter Jeremy Browne was not
able to make it today

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,540
he is the more technical person if our
team

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,170
and found the vulnerability is that I'm
going to discuss today

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,540
at if I make mistakes describing this
village those vulnerabilities

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,549
it's his fault at what we're going to
talk about today

16
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,229
is what is Microsoft owner Billy
research because I imagine you probably

17
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:10,409
have not heard at

18
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,940
I and how do we operate what we do and
where things go wrong in that process

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,070
we'll talk through a a few examples

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,270
out for her abilities that we found and
reported through the program

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,610
there are four vulnerabilities listed in
the slides but we only are when you talk

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,750
about through them today

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,180
if you're interested in the others I can
talk to you after the program I'm going

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,690
to talk about some things we've learned
in this process because

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,799
it's been very interesting for us to
switch from our traditional role as a

26
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,299
vendor

27
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,440
kicks reports and fixes them into a role
where we report for your abilities to

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,750
other third parties we're not going to
talk in great depth

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,440
about how we handle vulnerabilities
inner own products we are going to talk

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,930
a little bit about brownies

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,760
because I understand that's a topic
thats interesting for this community

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,510
I'm were also not going to talk about
any upcoming vulnerabilities

33
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,869
everything we discussed today is
something that has already been

34
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:01,549
addressed

35
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,299
and we don't spend a lot of time
discussing disclosure philosophies full

36
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,189
disclosure

37
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:12,140
corny disclosure that's just not the
purpose so what is

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,569
Microsoft Word research what the program
that started in 2008

39
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,799
it was founded by King Cyrus too many of
you may know

40
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:23,639
and announced that black cat and the
program started because

41
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,870
Microsoft was finding that many bugs we
were aware of

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,230
internally also affected third party
software

43
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,489
and we needed a way to help those third
party vendors

44
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,919
addressed the vulnerabilities their
software

45
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,709
so that they can make their customers
more secure and

46
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,859
this is distinct from the Microsoft
Security Response Center although it's

47
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:44,299
part

48
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,099
the MSRC and at the MSRC handles

49
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,930
problems with our own products and SPR
deals with problems and

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,659
other people's products it's also not
the same as Microsoft Downey program

51
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,980
I we'll talk more about bounties in a
moment I don't score

52
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,059
mstr is a program to help Microsoft
employees report security

53
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,989
vulnerabilities

54
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:10,109
in third party products at the purpose
of this program

55
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,840
is to help out are internal finders to
the program itself does not employ

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,099
researchers we work with the researchers
who already work for Microsoft

57
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,489
add and we provide some basic services

58
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:27,730
we take the annoying part 2 reporting a
vulnerability away from a researcher

59
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,010
so we handle tracking down contact
information story and databases that

60
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,359
contact information

61
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,120
and providing a lot of the go-between
resources to find the right people and

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,819
get the right things done we'll talk

63
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,760
specifically how that works our goal is
to keep everyone on the same page

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,209
we don't want this communication we
don't want I summer researchers

65
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,400
are interesting people who I may not
work well with others

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,579
so we provide go-between to help improve
the relationship

67
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,650
and we are from Ilya with all the
principles and play in the security

68
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,489
ecosystem

69
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,949
whereas many of our internal employees
are not we also provide

70
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:11,029
a platform to give credit to our
researchers so when Microsoft

71
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:14,719
researcher fines and reports a
vulnerability they

72
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,970
I receive credit hopefully from the
vendor but they also receive credit from

73
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,760
Microsoft so there's a page

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,900
I'm which is like to hear will be
available in the slides

75
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,600
where you can go see I all
vulnerabilities that are researchers

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,820
have requested

77
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,110
have gotten fixed I third party products

78
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,240
it's not quite all because researchers
to have the ability to remain anonymous

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,180
the reason why we're so interested in
doing this

80
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,940
is third-party code is very important to
Windows we run

81
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,940
lots and lots of third-party software on
our platform

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,979
in fact third party software is more
commonly used to exploit Windows users

83
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,600
than anything built into Windows are
made by Microsoft to this is very

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,630
important to us

85
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,780
we also have a third party routers and
firmware running in our data centers and

86
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,880
in our devices

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,220
and we help their party aP's in our
software stores so

88
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,280
this is a very important area for us
we've worked with

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,690
a number of different vendors here and
its PR you can read the last

90
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,349
almost any company that make software
has received a vulnerability report

91
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:25,259
from your one of the other goals

92
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,330
we have for the program is to help make
sure

93
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,780
that we behave the way we would like
others to behave

94
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,160
we want for billions closure to happen
any coordinated in private matter

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,229
where parties are talking to each other
we want our reports to be interesting we

96
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:47,789
don't want bad bugs me what good bugs we
what bugs with clearly production steps

97
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,430
so that the vendor can take the report
and immediately start working on a fix

98
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,349
rather than having to spend time
understanding the pollard

99
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:00,620
there are three main classes

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,180
people within Microsoft report security
vulnerabilities

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,690
the first and most important is
individuals

102
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,190
we have people who work for us who are
probably like many of you

103
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,870
just interested in security and they're
finding security vulnerabilities

104
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,010
for fine or to help secure the products
that they use

105
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,320
we also have product teams true

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,360
worked with their party products for
example

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,470
the Windows house in SAP implementation
and that implementation

108
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,570
works with the open source on the
implementation

109
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,400
so when we test our own SMD code

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,500
we have to interface with Samba in the
process of doing that work some time to

111
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
find security vulnerabilities

112
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,480
or when we test PF functionality in
Windows we need to make sure it works

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,730
with

114
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,240
Adobe with other PDF readers in the
process of doing that

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,730
we find security vulnerabilities and to
report that when we do this we often

116
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,080
find

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,540
many vulnerabilities at once Microsoft
conducts extensive test passes with lots

118
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,250
of people

119
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,700
and that sometimes result in a large
number of simultaneous bug reports so

120
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,390
what are the benefits that this program

121
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,450
is to help the third party understand
why we're reporting

122
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,560
20 bucks to them all at once the last
thing is

123
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,180
we often just fine individual bugs in
the course of my normal testing

124
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,520
Windows tests thousands of applications
with every change we make

125
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,140
and sometimes you find security
vulnerabilities in at

126
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,450
we also have a legal aspect to this no
I'm not a lawyer

127
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,640
don't quote me on this don't sue me I

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,050
by we have a policy that states that
Microsoft employees

129
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,080
must use coordinated vulnerability
disclosure you cannot use for disclosure

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,590
if you are a Microsoft employee

131
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,390
I'm employees must notify an SBR

132
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,830
all vulnerabilities that the report
there's no obligation to report a

133
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,640
vulnerability

134
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,100
and there's no obligation to use the
amnesty are programmed to report that

135
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,480
winner bility if it's found on your own
time

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,480
and by II you do have to notify the
program so we know what's happening in

137
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,820
the security ecosystem

138
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,930
I we don't want to interfere with
relationships people already have

139
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,530
for example we have network vendors
employees who

140
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,820
said at Microsoft have offices in our
buildings and

141
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,290
so when we finally abilities we just
walk over to their office and tell them

142
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,850
we don't

143
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,870
to any kind of formal procedure I'm

144
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,250
but this program is really designed for
cases where we don't know how to get a

145
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,080
bug fixed

146
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,150
so few words about the guys to
understand is the topic of interest here

147
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,450
I'm we do allow our employees to collect

148
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,789
about so if you work for Microsoft and
you find a security vulnerability on

149
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,070
your own time

150
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,450
you can report it to you a company that
pays about Downey or you can even

151
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,530
reported to a vulnerability broker liked
is your day initiative

152
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,700
and you'll be eligible for Downey now in
order to qualify for that

153
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,080
you need to be you need to have found
the vulnerability without using company

154
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,980
resources

155
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,370
show to to accept money you need to be
surely your own work using your own

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,930
computers in your own accounts

157
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,720
I you are actually allowed to use
company computers & Company tools we

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,590
have some very good internal security
tools

159
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,610
to find security vulnerabilities but
you're not allowed to collect a bug

160
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,750
bounty for those things

161
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,310
use Microsoft's assets to do it at we
also have our own background programs

162
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,490
we have an online services bug bounty
where we pay varying amounts of money

163
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,940
into the thousands of dollars

164
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,910
for vulnerabilities in a specific set of
online services so it's not every

165
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,870
service by is particularly focused on
the office 365 services

166
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,790
we have a large bounty for mitigation
bypasses

167
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,350
that money could be as much as fifty
thousand dollars for an obligation

168
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,010
bypass

169
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,370
at fifty thousand additional dollars for
II

170
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,530
defensive techniques that address those
bypasses

171
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,600
the reason why we offer these brownies
is to you

172
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,850
point researchers in a new direction so
we

173
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,460
have a very good research community
around windows and Internet Explorer

174
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,050
that we work very cooperatively with but
we see areas where the research

175
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,690
community

176
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,450
isn't as robust reason as interested
actually offer bounties in those areas

177
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,020
to have researchers work on problems
that we think

178
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,440
aren't getting the attention they
deserve and we found that county

179
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
programs do attract attention they get
people working on areas

180
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,930
better novel to them and that helps us
make breakthroughs

181
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,970
in areas that we think are interesting
so we had great success with a bounty

182
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,780
programs we're very happy with them

183
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,760
and we're continually evaluating them
for new options you can expect Microsoft

184
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,230
to be a source of innovation in this
area in the future

185
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,320
at we we encourage you all is well to
participate in those

186
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,870
informations available on our website
let me talk a little bit now

187
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,120
how this program actually works the
first at is once you found a

188
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,940
vulnerability

189
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,880
you report it to us we have an internal
web form to make it very easy to provide

190
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,180
us all the information

191
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,720
you need or you can just send us an
email the second step

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,540
is to you verified this report is high
quality report

193
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,360
does it have enough information to
understand the vulnerability

194
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,100
is the vulnerability actually something
serious we don't want to waste peoples

195
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,710
time by reporting things art

196
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,600
actually security issues so we verify
that the meat a certain level

197
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,290
severity before we release it we
generally ask are finders to produce a

198
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,860
proof-of-concept file

199
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,920
something that can be easily executed by
the vendor to demonstrate the

200
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,770
vulnerability

201
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,070
we like to include stack traces and we
like to include ideas for fixes

202
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,270
these are the kinds of things that make
for high quality but report

203
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,710
and that's what we want to give to a
third party and we will actually work

204
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,440
with people

205
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,020
to help them bring their research up to
that level we do this is a service we

206
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,220
can provide for our researchers a way to
help them

207
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,340
be better at their research the next
thing we do

208
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,730
is make sure that we don't have this
problem so

209
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,030
we often have a version of the software
that the third party makes

210
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,080
if there's a PDF bug we need to make
sure that that doesn't affect Microsoft

211
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,890
PDF readers

212
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,270
if there's a bug in in that crunk at

213
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,870
SSL stock we need to make sure that
windows as a cell stack

214
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,780
doesn't help so we perform this check
before report bugs

215
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,920
and fix anything that needs to be fixed
on our site don't wat

216
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,300
to report the vulnerability into we have
delivered our pics

217
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,590
we report the vulnerability immediately
but we coordinate with the third parties

218
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,090
that everyone chips Texas simultaneously

219
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,680
this is actually the hardest step

220
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,090
reporting the vulnerability to the
vendor because many many vendors

221
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,550
do not publish contact information and

222
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,820
when they do publish contact information
it's often not specific to security

223
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,700
so we spent a lot of time trying to find
the right person to talk to you

224
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,010
I once we found them we want to make
sure we exchange information securely

225
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,320
so we will request a PGP or estline

226
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,870
and the typical response

227
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,060
to that is

228
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,250
white is pgp so

229
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,690
we actually have a template that walk
people through how to install pgp

230
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,250
ap once we solve that will send them
further information

231
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,050
once we've reported the vulnerability

232
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,030
we work with the company while they fix
it and

233
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,090
this is at the longest portion I'll

234
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,690
the process because some companies are
not very fast

235
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,390
ed we found that it doesn't correlate
much with size

236
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,510
there are some small companies who work
very quickly

237
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,990
and there are some large companies work
very slowly

238
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,860
and also very quickly so I we stay in
touch with them throughout

239
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,360
there's a conversation between that
company and the Finder

240
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,040
about technical issues about the
severity of the vulnerability

241
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,490
we help mediate that conversation
finally

242
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,030
the vendor will ship an update we hope I
we spend a lot of time

243
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,310
helping them to understand the need to
provide credit or researchers

244
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,370
our researchers are not being paid for
this pollard

245
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,540
their own reporting it because they
think it's the right thing to do because

246
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,680
it helps users

247
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,240
and the only thing that they will get in
return is a credit

248
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,580
is public acknowledgement that work show
be

249
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,380
we strongly urge all people who make
software to credit

250
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,870
researchers who report Boehner bill is
too damn and

251
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,200
often there is a lack of understanding
why it matters:

252
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,520
our program helps those vendors
understand why giving a credit matters

253
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,530
and sometimes we've actually

254
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,720
worked with them after the fact to
credit our finders

255
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,930
we also will release our own advisories
we accept reformed

256
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,410
this we have a very long advisory that
we use when we think about particularly

257
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,720
needs attention so we use this format

258
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,900
to tell our users that there's a third
party bug that they need to get patched

259
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,120
for I and we've generally not seen

260
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,580
and too many of these we generally find

261
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,780
that users update quickly I

262
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,800
and

263
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,820
ac sorry we don't use this too often the
other thing

264
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,330
is our finders are allowed to release
their own advisories or blog posts or

265
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,790
other content want the vulnerability has
been patched I

266
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,850
we don't stop them from doing that
here's an example of what that looks

267
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,340
like

268
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,570
and these are on our website

269
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,660
we also have a smaller page

270
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,780
where we simply missed individuals who
reported bugs

271
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,310
most vulnerabilities are not severe
enough for us to

272
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,460
make a specific advisory to customers so

273
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,840
we just list the persons name the bug
the severity and thus offer that it was

274
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,470
founded

275
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,500
now we'll talk about a couple specific
vulnerabilities were

276
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,270
we've reported in this program the first
is

277
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,840
in the baby Kodak dis was an SBR

278
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,330
12 dash 07 team I had we started

279
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,850
by facing the LC with wana files

280
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,400
until we found some crashes at that
actually fairly easy

281
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,670
I'm you start your father you write it
you get crashes

282
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,160
the hard part is understanding whether
those crashes are interesting or not

283
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,640
and show at we

284
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,420
first checked with the bank exploitable
plugin if you haven't heard of paying

285
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,260
exploitable

286
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,360
its a free plugin that Microsoft makes
available

287
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,910
for the debugger that will automatically
analyze a crash

288
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,390
and you n indication of whether it
constitutes a security vulnerability or

289
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,810
not

290
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,480
add so in this case being exploitable
says that this

291
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,050
is likely a security vulnerabilities
that this is worth spending time on to

292
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,250
understand and it also identifies the
source

293
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,460
as this the baby Kodak plugin dot DL

294
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,940
which means this is not actually a
problem in VLC but in the Kodak

295
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,760
so what we're going to do you is def the
first file

296
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,540
against the real file the original file
and see what changed she probably can't

297
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,850
see this on the screen

298
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,760
but what changed is 801 280 said

299
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,209
and what does that mean

300
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:09,339
this is hey expiry not

301
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,829
usable at but

302
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,360
can threaten to destroy or and find out
microsoft has released

303
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,980
public 20 called of his of his

304
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,360
is available on our website was released
many years ago and

305
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,909
it purses files to you

306
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:31,899
help you understand how the file format
applies to that

307
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:36,360
particular file it comes with
definitions for office

308
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,440
files but its extensible so that other
file types can be

309
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,260
added here's what this looks like

310
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,529
when you load a file with of its it will
show you exactly the file structure

311
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,669
the names of the field according to the
file specification

312
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:55,710
and what those values are in that
particular file

313
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,809
so in this case if you have a telescope

314
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,649
you could see that this file says down
to my own screen

315
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,669
you can see that the file says tight
specific data SF audio

316
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,559
media type number of channels bath the
field that's been changed

317
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,169
so now we know something's we figured
out that a SF is a container format for

318
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:18,269
wana files

319
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,529
and we can look up that particular field
in the asss

320
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,559
specification and when we do that we see
this is a 16-bit value

321
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,730
it's a member of the way for not ac
structure

322
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,029
and it's supposed to be. the number of
new channels for this contact

323
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:38,450
well it turns out that I've never on
your channels is never supposed to be

324
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,880
set

325
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,580
costs and air in fact changing the value

326
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,399
to anything from three to eight just by
manually editing the file

327
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,090
causes a crash I'm we also found two
interesting behavior few changes tonight

328
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,539
that we didn't explore further

329
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,029
I a two-week we can trap this crash and
see what happens

330
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:02,490
and what we notice is to instructions
poppy be axed and

331
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,970
call water sectional retake at

332
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,919
and for those who no assembly hacking
this

333
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,090
exploitable conditions so we can tell
that we're going to be able to

334
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,519
exploits portability now I'm and

335
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,140
where

336
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,210
we're confident at this point that this
is an exploitable bug and we've done the

337
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,530
research that we report the
vulnerability

338
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,120
we can tell the vendor why this is a
problem wide

339
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,430
exit so at this point we rode out what
we found

340
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,830
and we sent it over to you VLC to pass
along to the Kodak Company

341
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,140
and and the SPR

342
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,290
so all that came before this was done by
Jerry Brown

343
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,890
once the package it up he handed off to
an SBR

344
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,900
he went back to his day job and SBR

345
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,910
found the right people to talk to it PLC
and work with them to set a release date

346
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,780
for the update

347
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,440
ensure that they met at least a we also
answered some basic questions they had

348
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,090
and went back to gerry has the technical
questions this was ultimately

349
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,480
patched in May of 2012 and we released
are

350
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,380
advisory a couple months later a second
case study

351
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,790
is a vulnerability we reported in VMware
this was

352
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,840
and SPR 13 dash 02 at the first thing we
started with our analysis a VMware was

353
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,240
the file types that processes and in
particular we focus on the

354
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,230
own bf file type: this is the open
virtual machine for not is essentially

355
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,280
an actual based

356
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,730
format for describing the medina virtual
machines

357
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,940
I the nice thing about XML

358
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,540
it's a very nice passing target I so

359
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,860
before we started that we actually
analyzed and

360
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,310
that the process flow it turns out that
VMware doesn't directly

361
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,060
load yes files it uses a separate
utility to do that

362
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,580
we research information about that
utility

363
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,840
itself stand alone XD and what we
eventually found

364
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,140
wise I if you pass into that 20

365
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,340
an XML format that includes percent PE

366
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,840
format strings better spectively point
to point there's

367
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,030
I'm well this was not handled well

368
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,230
I'm in this dialog you can see that
displaying

369
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,480
the content friend apart memory so this
is an indication again

370
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,090
likely exploitable vulnerabilities so as
we search for their

371
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,750
we reported this to you then that in
this case we have an ex

372
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,120
outstanding relationship with the VMware
security team

373
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,170
number than actually used to work for
Microsoft and show

374
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,530
we reported this to the relatively early
because we knew that they would be able

375
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,050
to take it the rest of the way

376
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,720
and fully understandable Billy so we
gave it to them quickly

377
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,630
at the issues security update at

378
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,030
we've learned some things throughout
this process and

379
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,370
one of the things we colored is that
vendors range very greatly

380
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,270
in their capacity I mention this earlier
we have worked with some very large

381
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,070
companies

382
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,830
proved very very quickly issued security
updates within just a couple of days

383
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,890
we've also worked with some very large
companies who worked very very slowly

384
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,530
in many cases we've happens outstanding
from local

385
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,700
years without pics and this is not a
case where the

386
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,410
the vendor didn't respond to Microsoft
this is a case where there

387
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,350
actively working on it providing status
updates but they're just having trouble

388
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,760
fixing the vulnerability

389
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,150
microsoft does not believe that it's
ever the right thing to release a

390
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,670
vulnerability to the public

391
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,950
I'm we we just think that cooperative
relationship

392
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,550
is always the right way to go and we

393
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,559
have struggled to come up with ways to
incentivize

394
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,470
spenders to work faster but we do have
some leverage

395
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,690
many companies have large contract with
Microsoft partnerships with Microsoft

396
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,700
and show when we have trouble with the
vendor were often able to work with them

397
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,340
through other business channels to help
them understand

398
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,220
why it's important to release day
quickly what would generally found with

399
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,330
larger vendors

400
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,440
is that they want to do the right thing

401
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,920
but they don't have the technical skills
to do it I'm

402
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,510
and sometimes that's a long process
where we have to start

403
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,360
at their executive level helping them
understand why securities import

404
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,010
I not for the reasons why my program
exists on the other hand

405
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,230
we had some very bad experiences with
small companies

406
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,230
you normally think about them house
actual

407
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,809
I S you talk to the developer directly
by

408
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,750
many these companies have no security
skill and no time to learn security

409
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,309
scale

410
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,929
I large company we can always assume
that they can afford higher security

411
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:39,830
developer

412
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,650
buddy to come

413
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,700
any that employs 2 people they can't do
that so that's

414
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,250
I in some cases we had to teach them all
about security ourselves

415
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,930
another thing that we've learned is

416
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,960
I'm there's a variety of behaviors

417
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,630
that researchers display and some people
view their responsibility as

418
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,990
only to generate a crash dump or we
don't think that's a good way to

419
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,220
interact with a third party

420
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,910
it's not very nice to run a fighter and
said 105

421
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,310
files to a third party when most those
files are not demonstrating security

422
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,880
issue

423
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,600
it you're either going to cause a third
party to spend a lot of unnecessary time

424
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,590
examining those files when you're going
to cost their party to not look at them

425
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,840
because they decide that

426
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,380
you are not helping them and if there is
a security issue in one of those files

427
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,440
they won't look at so

428
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,650
we believe it's very important to
examine your files before you report

429
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,050
them in only report really

430
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,000
interesting things and we ask that you
report on their abilities to ask that

431
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,790
you do the same

432
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,030
at the other problem we've had

433
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,380
is there are people who are so
passionate about security that they

434
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,750
think

435
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,050
every little problem is the biggest
problem in the world

436
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,880
and we want to help those people
understand that there is a ranger

437
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,580
problems

438
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,950
and this is not to say that some sick
that all security problems are not

439
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,690
problems

440
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,780
but they have different levels
severities the world will not

441
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,020
and tomorrow if across a sleeping bag is
in patch within 24 hours

442
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,280
it should be by that's a very big
difference compared to you

443
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,290
a remote code execution flaw in a wide
these pieces software that's likely to

444
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,250
be using a true

445
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,030
attack where actively being used attack

446
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,770
one of the other things we've learned
through this program

447
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,500
is this is a great benefit for employed
our researchers

448
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,030
love this program they love the fact
that they can find some issue

449
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,440
and report to Microsoft at report mstr

450
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,650
and they're not worry about it anymore
they can go back to doing the research

451
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,690
that they'll up

452
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,460
and it's also important for people who
don't know anything about security

453
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,080
most of our developers know how to write
SecureCode

454
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,130
but they don't know anything about how
to manage a vulnerability

455
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,480
and show what they found

456
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,330
something they need help and we are help
add

457
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,280
they value this a lot so we had great
success

458
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,150
sharply relationships at the other thing
about this program

459
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,179
is extremely cheap I'm the we actually
don't have a full time person running

460
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:07,870
this program

461
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,520
I manage the program among a number
other programs the person who does most

462
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,070
of the work for this program

463
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,470
has other jobs as well so is very easy
to do something

464
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,470
very very impactful it does not take a
lot of time so I would encourage

465
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,140
any company that as a large enough
employee base

466
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,780
to find I to find all your abilities

467
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,200
to run a program like this I'll as I
mentioned it 8

468
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,419
something that employees really value
out because it gives them something

469
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,960
where the they can follow a standardized
process without needing to know all the

470
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,760
details

471
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,220
I'm you know to be honest we found that
the number of security

472
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,530
researchers who are doing this is a
hobby is a very small percentage of all

473
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,740
Microsoft employees

474
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,049
much less than one percent of all
Microsoft employees participate in this

475
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:57,660
program

476
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,150
but the people who are participating in
this program are extremely passionate

477
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,140
about security

478
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,179
and having this program makes them feel
much better about working for our

479
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:07,780
company

480
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,320
these are people who we love having work
for us the very talented individuals

481
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,340
and show when you go back to your own
company's think about

482
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,440
those few people will be very very
excited to have a program like this

483
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,490
the last thing is we are not the only
company

484
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,020
cruise product depends on other as we've
heard throughout this

485
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,419
the these talks and as I think many you
know

486
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,330
we are all interdependent now almost
every product includes lots of their

487
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,200
party code

488
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,820
think about shell shock in about partly
in about these other issues

489
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,890
we all have other people's code in our
software

490
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,919
we all interconnect with services and
devices

491
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,990
from across the industry and if we don't
have a good way to work together

492
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,549
we're going to cause problems for each
other

493
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,549
and we've seen that when issues became
public prematurely

494
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,019
and some website were exploited it
wasn't because anybody wanted to

495
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,809
bear some the one it wasn't because we
want to

496
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:11,080
someone want to cause problems it was
just a simple failure to communicate

497
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,899
and having a program in place

498
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,340
with a defined process help prevent
those mistakes

499
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,989
there are some things that we found

500
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:27,210
as a finder that made us think about how
we behave as a vendor

501
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,590
and back makes us by ask

502
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:35,129
you who have software to do some things
to help it

503
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:38,330
hope us help you so please publish

504
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,379
a clearly identified point of contact
for security forward

505
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:45,690
let us know where we should send this
information

506
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,830
at we spend far too much time

507
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,149
talking with support staff explaining to
them why we don't have a support

508
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:53,999
contract

509
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,899
why we don't have an official license to
the software but we are trying to help

510
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:58,480
you

511
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,460
am give us something like security at
your company dot com

512
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,159
secure at your company dot com where it
would be very easy to reach you

513
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,190
publish an encryption key this is
important for two reasons

514
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,559
it's important for us to be able to send
you information quickly

515
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,169
I'm consider that there may be a public
for their ability or exploit in your

516
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:22,919
software

517
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,690
that we need to tell you about at that
needs to happen quickly

518
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,279
and if you have a public key we can do
that the second thing to consider

519
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,989
is what if some problem happens in your
company's website or your software

520
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:40,009
that makes people distrust her
communications

521
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:45,309
this is not happened in to us in real
life but it exercises which simulated

522
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:50,909
possible breaches our website what what
how do you get message to your customers

523
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:55,460
about the truth at how to recover if
your website can't be trusted

524
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,840
you can't post anything on your website
because they want trusted

525
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,110
but if you have a public in Christian
key

526
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,480
they will know that anything signed with
Aki is likely trust

527
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,290
worth at as long as you established the
key itself

528
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,570
secured add it's a hundred percent
solution

529
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:18,980
at work with your support staff to
understand for their abilities

530
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,790
we have a number of times worked with
support staff

531
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:27,430
who at acknowledged that we were
reporting a security vulnerability

532
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,680
but said we would have to pay for a
hotfix to get it fixed

533
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,880
I'm we ourselves

534
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,090
work with our own support staff to
understand that when a vulnerability is

535
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,750
reported

536
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,630
that should be immediately forwarded to
a security professional rather than hand

537
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,350
with your customer support channels

538
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:48,900
because I you can't afford to have a
vulnerability become public or be

539
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,280
exploited or you can simply not be fixed

540
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,990
because your support staff doesn't
understand the impact

541
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,400
these are issues that most companies

542
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,900
never think about so the reason we're
here talking

543
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:09,380
is so that you go back and think about
when you work with us

544
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,510
we'd like to see clear communication I'm

545
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,030
this seems like something basic but more
often than not we do not have an

546
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,390
effective communication with the people
we work with

547
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,800
I'm right back to us when we send you an
initial email

548
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,840
even if it's an automatic reply at least
we know we've gotten

549
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,340
allied gmail account tell us whether
you've successfully reproduce the issue

550
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,560
sometimes we're wrong sometimes we
report a bug

551
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,180
that does not reproduce sometimes we
report a bug that's contingent on a very

552
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,090
specific

553
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,770
configuration that we help but no one
else does

554
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,760
so please tell us if we found something
real or not we don't want to waste your

555
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,270
time

556
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,040
if we found something that problem at

557
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,620
please tell us when you're going to
shift the update we have had a number of

558
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,320
times

559
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,950
where we paint someone month after month

560
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,430
after month and six months after we
start they say

561
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,940
we fix that for months ago so please
don't do that

562
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,600
I'm

563
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,300
we would like more advanced behavior

564
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,890
credit us ask us how we want to be
credited

565
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,930
we at we generally credit Microsoft
founder Bill the research

566
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,320
and are finders but some people don't
want to be credited

567
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,410
some people would like to be credited
under a pseudonym and so please ask

568
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,530
at the other thing which is

569
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,730
a whole topic up its own is variant
investigation by this

570
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,230
I mean check for a million bucks when we
report something to you

571
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,970
we found one-issue almost always

572
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,300
there are other bugs in that code and a
problem we've seen

573
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,760
in the industry is that people fix the
one vulnerability that was reported to

574
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,150
them

575
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,950
and then they stop looking they go home
and they call it good well

576
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,080
that the programmer who wrote that code
made a mistake

577
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,170
the problem each others dicks even if
they are very very good programmer

578
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,180
its once you release a security update

579
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,740
it's going to be reverse-engineered and
people are going to look

580
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,850
in the surrounding coach so real
internally

581
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,520
look at a number of different related
vulnerabilities we look for

582
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,850
I things that are in the same part of
the file for

583
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,030
they may be handled in a completely
different Copac but there will be bugs

584
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,380
that are found game related code in

585
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,030
really departure the file format the
only budget will be found in similar

586
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,880
code pass

587
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,860
often we found that code is copy and
pasted

588
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,720
so do a simple fined for that same but
you live code you will probably find

589
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,810
other box at do a check for

590
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:55,350
at the same research method we want saw
a researcher who submitted three bug

591
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,380
reports to us

592
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,470
I'm all using the same exact file and
they were doing

593
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,680
sequential file fighting they took and
FF by

594
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,270
and they moved down the file one bite at
a time

595
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,600
and by the time they got halfway through
the file they found three exploitable

596
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,580
vulnerabilities

597
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,650
and they sent them to us had so

598
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,020
we figured he was going to continue

599
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,929
thing that bite down file ok so we did
that ourselves

600
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,290
and found several additional border
village so take

601
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,140
what the researcher has done and do it
yourself

602
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,530
the other thing to

603
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:38,610
raised their is Microsoft has a
significant about security resources

604
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,240
and we tend to find all the bugs that we
think to look for

605
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,580
and in general developers will find the
bugs

606
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,740
that they look for what external
research provides for you

607
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,250
is an idea of what you are not looking
for

608
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,760
it tells you the things that you haven't
thought of and this is why security

609
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,650
research

610
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,060
is so valuable to Microsoft we hire

611
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,040
lots security testers and they find lots
upon their abilities

612
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,140
but they all work for us they all think
like

613
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,630
us they work with the people who work
with us and show

614
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,560
they look in the places that microsoft
knows to look the security community

615
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,630
books in the places that Microsoft duck

616
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,630
add every time a vulnerability is
reported to us

617
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,370
we examine that code and we realize

618
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,570
often that there are many
vulnerabilities in that code it's

619
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,060
something

620
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,820
it's a piece of code we didn't know
about or to testing technique we didn't

621
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,610
know about

622
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,360
or it's a piece of code where the person
who tested it did a bad job

623
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,640
does happen so

624
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,680
we're very very much value the
participation in the community

625
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,950
because it helps us preview and when we
find a mistake that we've made

626
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,980
we can solve that mistake across all of
our products we can take that

627
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,840
information across

628
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,530
all of our products and what we want to
see is

629
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,080
other people doing the same thing we
report a vulnerability

630
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,410
we want to see not just got only ability
fixed

631
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,840
but fifty or a hundred or thousand
additional vulnerabilities text

632
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,090
because our vulnerability show that
company

633
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,140
where to look for vulnerabilities that's
what we want to see for the industry.

634
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,570
and we have a long way to go as an
industry there are thousands upon your

635
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,140
abilities

636
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,569
in essentially every piece of software

637
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:32,270
we don't fix those for their abilities
one at a time

638
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,809
we fix them hundreds or thousands at a
time that's the only way we can make a

639
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:39,359
measurable impact on the number for
their abilities

640
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,559
our software it's expensive it's hard to
do

641
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,640
it's very hard to have a conversation
with your manager

642
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,020
at their manager and the vice president
and the president about how much money

643
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,089
this will cost

644
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:55,420
by the cost a breach

645
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,869
if your company the cost a breach at a
customer site

646
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:02,920
is far far greater far far greater

647
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,660
this is a lesson Microsoft has learned
the hard way you probably have heard

648
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,190
slammer and blaster and major major

649
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,789
customer problems caused by security
flaws in our software

650
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:19,430
that was a long time ago we've come a
long way

651
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,049
we're still not perfect but

652
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:26,470
we have some things we've learned that
we want others to learn

653
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,109
to you we want everyone to be secure
even our competitors

654
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,410
and if there's one thing you take away

655
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,289
its when someone reported vulnerability
to you be thorough

656
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,380
use it as an opportunity use it as a
chance

657
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,700
to fix all the bugs you know or area
code

658
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,990
and never happen problem again this is
what we want to see

659
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,049
oh and also please do it quickly

660
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:55,730
we we understand the complexities and
engineering

661
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,950
large pieces of software we understand

662
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,609
that some vulnerabilities take a long
time to fix I'm

663
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,839
we also understand that some
vulnerabilities don't take a long time

664
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,460
to fix

665
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,589
we understand that there are some things
that should be done quickly

666
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:13,130
add we're in a good position when we
report for your abilities

667
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,760
to help you understand the right amount
of time to spare

668
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,809
so be thorough

669
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:24,470
but be quick and be diligent easier

670
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,839
issues that rock assault tomorrow but

671
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,220
by working together we can make all of
our customers better we can make

672
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,539
all ourselves more secure at eventually

673
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:39,850
in in twenty or fifty or a hundred years
we should not be talking

674
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,980
about code for your abilities anymore
this is

675
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,980
fundamentally every bone ability is a
programming error

676
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,440
and one of the goals of this program is
overtime

677
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,020
very long time not ten years 20 fifty
years

678
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,140
to reduce the number of all abilities
all software

679
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,640
and we encourage you

680
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,360
to be diligent in that work we hope that
this talk

681
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,360
is a resource you can use when you go to
your own company's to say microsoft does

682
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,790
this and so we should to you

683
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,090
i'm happy to provide a personal
intervention

684
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,570
with anyone who needs to hear from
Microsoft that this is something we do

685
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:18,900
you

686
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,670
this is also documented on our website
recruit everyone how programs like this

687
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,460
to respond well to vulnerability reports
thank you

688
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:34,410
and i cant a question now so thank you
for your presentation

689
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:39,120
how do you handle the timing

690
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,480
Ivan release

691
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,960
other on both information for example
said

692
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,780
organization do you think we should I
work closely together with them

693
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,280
or is it better to not to align with
them at all

694
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,770
I can question thank you

695
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,020
I'm question is by when it comes to the
timing

696
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,120
love releasing vulnerability information
how do we manage that and we work with

697
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,480
certain organizations

698
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,920
and the the answer is we work with

699
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,690
the vendor to understand their preferred
timing

700
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:20,270
and if their preferred timing is not
good for their customers

701
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,410
we work to persuade them to change that
time

702
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,790
I'm that applies to you their
information

703
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,760
their publication and our publication so
if they ask us not to publish before a

704
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,680
certain date

705
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,130
we will not publish before that date
however

706
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,110
we will work with them to improve that
date

707
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:44,140
if the date is not good I

708
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,390
with regards to the cert organizations
we will work with searched

709
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,050
depending on the country and that search
brawl

710
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,030
I some countries the search is very
involved in other countries

711
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,340
the Certus not very involved and so we
we will work with the SIR

712
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,060
where's helpful I N we have
relationships

713
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,550
with essentially all asserts I and

714
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,750
we will work with them where is helpful
