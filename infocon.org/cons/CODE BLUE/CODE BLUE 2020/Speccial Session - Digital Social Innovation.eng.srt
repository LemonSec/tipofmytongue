1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,079
our next session is

2
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,480
special session digital social

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,760
innovation

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,480
please welcome our speaker audrey tang

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,040
ori

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,160
please start hello

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,320
really happy to be here virtually to

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,440
share with you

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,399
some thoughts about digital innovation

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,879
uh especially in the kind of corona

11
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
and here is my mask wearing a mask

12
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
hand sanitation these are the most

13
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,600
important

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
technologies it's like the physical

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,760
vaccine but digital

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,799
technologies also helps eye adjusted

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,760
fashion in taiwan we're talking about

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,280
digital social innovation

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
we talk about the three things that is

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,560
fast fair and fun

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
the first part is the collective

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,080
intelligence

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
as you know in taiwan we have this idea

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,840
of collective intelligence

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
of the wisdom at the edge meaning that

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
the people who know the most about any

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
emergent situation

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,400
is actually just the citizens in the

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
taiwanese equivalent

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
of reddit which we call the ptt

31
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
the pt team is not for profit it's

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,759
maintained

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,399
by the national taiwan university and

34
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,520
last december

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,159
when dr liu and leon the rc

36
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,360
whistleblower

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
hosted there's seven new source cases in

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,880
the

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,520
one and seafood market here it gets

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
reposted by

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
no more pipe a young doctor in ptt

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,878
immediately and then not only did we

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,440
email the world health organization but

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
the very next day

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
or our medical officers started health

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
inspections

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
for all the passengers from ohio to

48
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,400
taiwan and so this shows that

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
in a complete freedom open society

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,720
where the freedom of expression of press

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
of assembly

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
is preserved we have a head start unlike

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,080
dr liu

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
which gets harmonized by the

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
institutions uh he actually saved

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
everybody in taiwan because we acted

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,879
early based on the collective

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,800
intelligence and that shows that the

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,040
citizens trust the government will not

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
repress this kind of whistleblowing and

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,080
the government

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
trusted citizens to come up with the

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,599
upvotes

64
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,480
based on scientific understanding and by

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
vetting the intelligence

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
that came from wuhan so right afterwards

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,920
we set up the central academic command

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
center or the cecc

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
with administration at the concert now

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,920
the ccc

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
not only has a live press conference

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
every 2 p.m

73
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
during the pandemic days and we also

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
have a toll-free number 1922

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
that everybody can call and report

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
anything

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
to their ccc so not only this answers

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
all the people's questions when it comes

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
to the science but also people can call

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
and say for example

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
a young boy april called saying you're

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,159
raising a mask

83
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,640
oh i get a pink medical mask i don't

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,519
want to wear to

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
school my classmates will laugh at me

86
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,519
and because of that well the very next

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,080
step

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
you can see here all the medical offices

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,120
for pink

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
medical class and that's very fast

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
iteration cycle

92
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
so the boy becomes the most hip boy in

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
the class because only he

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,560
has the color that the heroes wear the

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,519
second pillar

96
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
is called fairness when we're racing out

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
the mask

98
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,159
we have a very clear goal if we can

99
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,280
start

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
in early february and by march

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,079
get three quarter of people

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
wearing the mask and cleaning their

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
hands and we know

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
the basic transmission rate the r value

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,919
will be under one

106
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,720
meaning that the disease will not spread

107
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
so how can we get

108
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,639
three quarter of people getting the

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,360
mosques

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,440
well we work with the civic

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,639
technologists

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
and also the pharmacist more than six

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,919
thousand of them

114
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
already trusted by their neighborhoods

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
because many elderly people

116
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
go to the pharmacies to reveal their

117
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,520
prescriptions

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
we design the math creation to work

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
exactly the same

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
as getting the repeal prescriptions and

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
the pharmacists

122
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
of course devise their own ways by

123
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,919
sharing their real-time numbers of the

124
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,120
availability

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,080
with civic technologies so more than 100

126
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,720
tools

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
enabled to see which pharmacy near them

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
still have masculine stock

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,919
which has run out of the day and when

130
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,800
you're queuing

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
in the line people queuing after you can

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,880
refresh their phone and know that you

133
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,759
have been in

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,880
if you're a adult gets nine medical math

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
for two weeks

136
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,520
nowadays or 10 if you are a child

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,800
so this is called participatory

138
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
accountability

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
it also enables independent analysis of

140
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
the real-time campus

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
department if we publish this number

142
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,600
only

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,080
once a day then people cannot

144
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
participate in the auditing

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
and people cannot analyze the unevenness

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
in the distribution

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
but because we publish every 30 seconds

148
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:49,840
is an open

149
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
api so people for example

150
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,479
mp gohan and previously a vp

151
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
of foxconn working on data analytics

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,120
she asked minister 10 hey according to

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,479
the open street map

154
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,919
analysis while it looks fair uh on a

155
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,880
distance on the map it's actually unfair

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,440
if you

157
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,479
take into account the time that people

158
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,360
have to take

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
on public transportation administrators

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,039
did not

161
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,440
defend the policy at all he just said

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,479
legislator

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,639
teach us and then we immediately

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,919
co-created

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
the new design of the convenience store

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
pickup system

167
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,120
so everybody can pick up 24 hours a day

168
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
in the nearby convenience store you can

169
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,639
see our premiere

170
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
our head of cabinet fuji smiling happily

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,160
here

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
because by march we not only hit the

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,479
three-quarter

174
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,280
targets but actually by emperor

175
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,599
90 of people actually get the medical

176
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,160
mask

177
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,199
and use it in a responsible fashion

178
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,000
and finally the fun part how do we make

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,639
sure

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,280
that in the time pandemic we're panicked

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,080
by

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
where the disinformation conspiracy

183
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,919
theory constitutes

184
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,880
a info damage how can we make sure the

185
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,080
epidemic does

186
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
not hurt the society well we use this

187
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,479
idea called

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,520
humor over rumor basically

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
for any rumor we introduced after

190
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,919
two hours a very funny picture less than

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,120
200

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
characters and with two funny pictures

193
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,759
to make ensure that people can hear them

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
even after they see the conspiracy

195
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
theory they will still laugh

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
at our clarification and the

197
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
clarification with

198
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
a higher higher value of social media

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
and this information and conspiracy

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,360
theories

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
for example there was a time when people

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
went out and picked

203
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,759
my teacher papers because there was a

204
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,720
rumor that

205
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,759
i quote that all the two paper material

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,000
are

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
being confiscated to make medical marks

208
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,759
that's of course not true so the head of

209
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,280
cabinet premier

210
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
child roll out this within just a couple

211
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,720
hours

212
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
saying in very large forms that each of

213
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
us only have

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
one pair of buttons it's a

215
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,319
problem because the mandarine who

216
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,199
stockpile

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
porn sounds the same as 20

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,199
so by showing his icon and making

219
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,560
himself literally

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,039
the thought of the joke everybody i

221
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,160
shared with this went

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,958
viral and people see this table that

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,599
says

224
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,519
the medical masks are made out of

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,958
domestic materials

226
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
but the tissue papers are made of the

227
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
south community materials

228
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
so we don't confuse those two and within

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
a couple of days the panic lining died

230
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,680
down

231
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,800
and this is not just one part this is

232
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
for each and every

233
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
measures each by the cecc for example

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,320
there is a queue

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
pokestop that says

236
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
when you're keeping a physical distance

237
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
outdoor please keep

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
two shiva nino away if you're indoor

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,760
exclusion by you know

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,440
away cover your mouth and no sneezing

241
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
and why do you wear a mask where you

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,480
wear

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
a mask to protect yourself against your

244
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,200
own unwashed hands so this connects the

245
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
used and still be used together and this

246
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,640
dog meme

247
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,000
is far more viral than any panic buying

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,040
or disinformation that's how we remain

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
collected with the power of social

250
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,160
innovation

251
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
digitally in a time pandemic and this

252
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
enabled us

253
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
to now record uh 200 days actually more

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
than 200 days

255
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,240
with no local transmission cases if you

256
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
want to learn more

257
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,760
feel free to ask on fido and there's

258
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,800
also a website

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
at taiwan can help us so that's my

260
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,839
10 minute pitch thank you for listening

261
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,000
so i think we're at the kind of the

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,480
slider questions

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
let's see

264
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
here says it's the organizational

265
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,279
security policies

266
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
or the privacy rules get into the

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
innovation this time around

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,240
if you have experience to overcome it

269
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
you share it that's a great question

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,399
first of all

271
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
we do not collect new data

272
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
during the pandemic that's not already

273
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
collected before the pandemic

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
and the idea is very simple because if

275
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
you collect new data

276
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
and people will ask where do the data go

277
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
what's the data protection rules and so

278
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,959
on but for the data that's already

279
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,800
collected before the pandemic

280
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
people already know how it interacts

281
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
with the other parts of their data

282
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,200
behavior

283
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,160
for example when we're making sure that

284
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
people who stay insurance

285
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
in for 14 days we either

286
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,680
ask them to go to a quarantine hotel

287
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
physically

288
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
or they can also choose to remain at

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,920
home

290
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
if they have their own bathroom in their

291
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
home in the later days

292
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
if they break the current scene how

293
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
would we know

294
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
well we ask them to put their phone or

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
if they don't have a phone we give them

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,279
a phone

297
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,959
for two weeks into the digital fence

298
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
but we do not ask them to install an app

299
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
or to have a dongle or bracelet

300
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
or turn on bluetooth or anything because

301
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,040
those are

302
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
new data collection methods instead we

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,639
talked to the five

304
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,800
telecommunication operators the telecoms

305
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,079
already know

306
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,519
where their phone is but in a very rough

307
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,160
degree

308
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
in the urban area maybe 50 meter radius

309
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,720
so it knows which block they are in but

310
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
not which room

311
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
they are in and people already

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,040
understand

313
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
when they're facing a earthquake they

314
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
can get a fms

315
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,959
directly asking them to evacuate

316
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
because we have advanced earthquake

317
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,160
warnings

318
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
based on the telecom signal strength

319
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,720
triangulation and also the earthquake

320
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,839
prevention

321
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,720
we also have the same thing for blood

322
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
and typhoon warnings

323
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
so we just change that system and send

324
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
it as

325
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,839
if their phone breaks out of the

326
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,279
quarantine area

327
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,320
and the sms is sent to the local medical

328
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,040
workers

329
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
who would then check the person's

330
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
whereabouts

331
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
if they stay in the currency for 14 days

332
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,680
then we pay them 100 us dollars

333
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,639
a day to thank them for their efforts

334
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
but if they bring the quarantine

335
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,440
we find them um a lot more

336
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,160
like 1000 times that so people don't

337
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,560
break

338
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
out of the current scene but we don't

339
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
break the existing privacy norms

340
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
either because people understand the

341
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
triangulation

342
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
and the sms has no way to read their

343
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,560
email

344
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
or to control their phone or to turn on

345
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
their gps

346
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,040
or inter their bluetooth devices

347
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,240
so that is the basic idea of no new data

348
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,720
collection

349
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,600
another question asks

350
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
what system issues in the security

351
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
do you have to consider in implementing

352
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,000
the

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,680
covet counter measures security is not

354
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
just about

355
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,680
logical security it's also about the

356
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
feeling of

357
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
the sense of trust the security

358
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,639
in people's mind so i will use that

359
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,680
example

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
for example there was a time where a

361
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
person in an intimate

362
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
drinking bar his diagnosis was coveted

363
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
on the first day she did not admit

364
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,839
being a worker in such a nightlife place

365
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,240
because she is a professional and

366
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,279
anonymity

367
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
is very important in their trade but it

368
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
will very easily get

369
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
into a point where people would

370
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,240
say that oh these long life are against

371
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
our counter virus rules and this will

372
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,000
then

373
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
cause them to go underground because of

374
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
the stigma

375
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,600
so our cec did not

376
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,560
invoke sanctions or put people in jail

377
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
or find them

378
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
but rather they introduced this idea of

379
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
a real contact

380
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
system based on their prior work with

381
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
hiv plus

382
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,760
communities as long as people can be

383
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
contacted

384
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
no real name was necessary and so

385
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,880
the cec has the businesses in the

386
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,839
nightlife

387
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,959
only keep in paper their

388
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,160
contact numbers or emails but those

389
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
numbers do not need to be reported to

390
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
the central government

391
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
and so the businesses develop

392
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,800
creative approaches code names

393
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
single-use

394
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,920
prepaid phone cards cuts with plastic

395
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,560
shield

396
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,360
to maintain social distancing so they

397
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,839
get

398
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,199
reopened with the blessing of the

399
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,519
municipalities

400
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
and when even nightclub can join the

401
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,880
fight

402
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
then the security measures implemented

403
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,120
at the edges

404
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
is actually much more important to get

405
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
people into the feeling of

406
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
sense of safety and security and a

407
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
top-down way that will drive them

408
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
underground so this decentralization

409
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,079
and the trust of the government to the

410
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,880
citizens

411
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
i think is even more important than any

412
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,720
top-down measures

413
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,639
of security the next question

414
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,000
asks so

415
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,800
what kind of security engineers and

416
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,839
hackers

417
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,360
can help the cross-border

418
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
to make the world better this is

419
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,360
excellent question

420
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,959
well uh the civic technologist in china

421
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,000
implemented the not available map

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,199
they did not ask for anyone's permission

423
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,079
it is not a government procurement it is

424
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,639
not

425
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
something that we asked them to do they

426
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
just did it by themselves

427
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
and all i did is to get them the

428
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,240
real-time

429
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,399
open api and give them a gov

430
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
url a domain name letters

431
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,480
more than 100 of the civic technologies

432
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
contributions

433
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,279
in a official website and so one month

434
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
after that

435
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,839
in early march people in south korea

436
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,359
in seoul agreed to convince

437
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,559
their governments that our api needs to

438
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,359
be used

439
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,400
to make their mosque racing available

440
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,599
and so the first map that works in korea

441
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,720
was actually developed in tainan city

442
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,439
when the author of indian khan wrote it

443
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,000
out

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
were very amazed because he doesn't

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,440
speak korean

446
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
but it speaks javascript and the korean

447
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
public hackers

448
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
speak javascript that's the important

449
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
part in a similar way

450
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,240
code for japan which is uh by halo

451
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,039
and his friends implemented the stop

452
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,679
covet

453
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,240
dashboard for the tokyo metropolitan

454
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
government

455
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,840
not only the taiwanese hackers helped

456
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,039
translating

457
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,160
and perfecting the system i personally

458
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
also

459
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
participated in approved reading and

460
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,720
even corrected

461
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,000
a typo by sending a pull request so my

462
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,880
suggestion

463
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
is just to publish it on gitlab or

464
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,799
github

465
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,880
let everybody know about the work that

466
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
you do and before alone

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,440
your solution will not only be local it

468
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
will be global

469
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,080
as well so

470
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,960
another question asks so what about

471
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
global

472
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
issues how can we contribute to the

473
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,559
global assistance

474
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,799
well you can uh consult cohack.tw

475
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,799
cohck.tw

476
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,200
there are five winning teams that are

477
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
solving issues

478
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
that are making sure that the global

479
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,240
people

480
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,600
even when taiwan has no need

481
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,480
for example for the community tracing

482
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,679
program because we

483
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,000
don't have community threats we're still

484
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
working with the entire world

485
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,679
um uh factors such as the

486
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
visual storytelling to sort to decision

487
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,520
makers

488
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,559
that's called gemini x4 a distributed

489
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,039
ledger

490
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
based community awareness network

491
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,679
is called autonomy based on the bitmark

492
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,799
technology and also a personalized

493
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,600
diary keeping tool to facilitate content

494
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,320
tracing

495
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
without sacrificing privacy all this is

496
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,080
some

497
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
security engineers like you who have the

498
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,520
capability to look at the

499
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,240
contractification

500
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,640
pi not only

501
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,960
but also by the european union and so on

502
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,840
and we can work together

503
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,120
encroach on the privacy

504
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,600
another question i'll ask what

505
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
contribution can american

506
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,000
in the measurements that i talked about

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
we work closely with white hackers

508
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
with penetration and first so for

509
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
example in the cohab

510
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,880
system we use something called promis

511
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,919
p-o-l-i-s it's a

512
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,039
ai system that asks everybody around the

513
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,600
world

514
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,880
what's acceptable when it comes to

515
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,120
counter-pandemic

516
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
what's not acceptable and we focus only

517
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
to solve problems that have rough

518
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
consensus

519
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
about all the countries that participate

520
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
so we're now working with the security

521
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,000
research

522
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,039
firm the name is deathcore to

523
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,600
harvest the security of the opposite

524
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,320
system

525
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,360
so we can use it more in the future not

526
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
only country pandemic

527
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,919
but anything that requires

528
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,240
cross-cultural

529
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,280
international rough consensus listening

530
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
at scale

531
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
if you're interested at that you can

532
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,039
also look at the security profiles

533
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
the police of censboard of all the

534
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,120
different tools

535
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
that we use during accounting and file

536
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,400
cpes to detect um vulnerabilities

537
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
in those old systems because they are

538
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,840
all

539
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,200
sourced under the ppl

540
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,120
uh usb is will be themed by

541
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,799
across all the true factors and also

542
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
for all your countries so focus on

543
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,720
those components our toolkits and make

544
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,600
sure that

545
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
uh do the penetration and we can talk

546
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,400
about uh your cves and contribute

547
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,799
to fix them in real time that's all the

548
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,600
final questions and we still have a few

549
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,240
minutes

550
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,559
i don't know if the moderator would like

551
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:58,080
to ask me something or to shift all

552
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,960
right

553
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,559
if there is no more questions on slido

554
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,760
i will just remind you again uh to

555
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,880
wear your mask and wash your hands

556
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,679
the mask is here to protect ourselves

557
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,159
from

558
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,440
our own unwashed hands

559
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,039
while the physical distance between

560
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,600
our friends and families may be

561
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
temporarily isolated

562
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,480
the digital world has brought us even

563
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,520
closer

564
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,960
thanks to media conference and spider

565
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,679
if you want to make sure that your

566
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,039
contribution

567
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,159
gets to be amplified by your

568
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,440
government maybe you can share this

569
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,520
with them it's the pygmalion effect

570
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,200
the more the government trusts the

571
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,679
citizens including people in the

572
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
nightlife

573
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,480
the more citizens become trustworthy

574
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,880
if the government from top-down measure

575
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
doesn't trust

576
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
the citizens and citizens of course

577
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
become nonsense

578
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
this is a self-fulfilling prophecy

579
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,000
so the government can start with one

580
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
very simple principle

581
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,120
is to trust the citizens

582
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,400
more um thank you for listening

583
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
and thank you for the people outside of

584
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
who is that uh

585
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,760
and the direction of the innovation

586
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,120
in taiwan is open

587
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,679
by open we not only mean transparent and

588
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,000
participatory

589
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,039
but as you have heard in my conversation

590
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,159
in the 1922 in the toll-free number

591
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
it must also be accountable i love that

592
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,240
japanese

593
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,440
translation of accountability is

594
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,559
translated

595
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,320
as the ability to give an account

596
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,919
to the ability to explain clearly

597
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
so think about the ways to scale

598
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,400
listening but also think about what you

599
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
listen

600
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,440
how quickly is it every day is a week

601
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,919
that you can absorb the collective

602
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,960
intelligence

603
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,240
and amplify the best practices

604
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,320
our masquerading system gets weekly uh

605
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,679
improvements thanks to the pharmacist

606
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,720
that paul 1922 let us know how to

607
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,000
improve it

608
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,039
in terms of take a number system in

609
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,000
terms of

610
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,880
the queuing system in terms of automated

611
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,000
building system

612
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
and finally the convenience for

613
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,279
pre-order

614
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,919
and also it makes sure that the

615
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,760
innovation doesn't stop

616
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,320
when we stop working on it the citizen

617
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,559
developers can all come up with their

618
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,279
own ways

619
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,559
like vending machine in the taipei city

620
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,360
and that totally also improved people's

621
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,240
willingness

622
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,039
to try out this new mass committing

623
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,159
tools

624
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,960
i think we are uh at the time so i will

625
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,159
answer the last

626
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,520
uh question from slido asking uh

627
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
what kind of uh culture from japan do i

628
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,080
like

629
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,279
um my instagram

630
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
which is called digital minister or

631
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,799
lower case

632
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,919
digital minister uh it's the same uh

633
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,440
um my facebook as well

634
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,000
and if you check out my instagram you

635
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,960
will see a

636
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,320
video where i play the character

637
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,919
of dora ammo and to me ai

638
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,039
stands for assistive intelligence the

639
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,919
imo

640
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,120
symbolizes the idea of alignment and

641
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,760
accountability

642
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
for always

643
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
aligns with the human society's best

644
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,919
practices

645
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
it's not about terminator it's not about

646
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
eliminating any enemies

647
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,279
or ammo never does that but rather drama

648
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,400
shows the possible futures to

649
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
the community and can also show the

650
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
particular drawbacks

651
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,000
but at the end how to apply it is up

652
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
for the humans to make the judgments

653
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,840
and so not only is the alignment

654
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,720
accountable

655
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
but also it's fun as well it's very

656
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,039
uh lovely it's annoying and it's very

657
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
cute so the cuteness

658
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
that uh the persistent nature of the

659
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,640
assistive intelligence in the japanese

660
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,919
culture i think

661
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,640
is very very important especially in

662
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
this time of day

663
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,200
where we're working with more smart

664
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,320
than ever cities that we need

665
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,840
better citizens and in this taiwan

666
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,400
and japan are very much aligned and we

667
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,360
should work

668
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,679
together so thank you

669
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,480
and prosperity
