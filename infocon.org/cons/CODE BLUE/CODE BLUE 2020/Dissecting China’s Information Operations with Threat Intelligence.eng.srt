47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
taiwan's 2020 general election

summarize three key methods

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
to see how china is launching is

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
involved on social media

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,239
and last we will have a q a section

53
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
so if you have any question during our

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
talk please just type in

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
okay so what is information operation

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
information operation involved is also

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,760
called

58
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
influence operation or information

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,280
warfare

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
the term was first used in the u.s

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,560
military meaning to influence

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,599
the decision-making of the adversary

63
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
and in the era of social media the

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,519
social media service

65
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
is now the essential space for all

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,879
people to

67
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,920
exchange ideas and get the new

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
information

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
after 2016 russian interference against

70
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,040
the u.s election

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
the world has realized that state

72
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
sponsored information operation

73
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,879
could be used through the social media

74
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
these of the terrorist regions could use

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
social medias to launch

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
info up to spread propaganda

77
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,360
disinformation

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
and even hate speech china's involved

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,799
could be categorized

80
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
into two kinds of operations first one

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
is other operation meaning the

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,159
operations

83
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
are openly conducted and without any

84
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,640
concealment

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
we can easily identify the other actors

86
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,560
as the agent of the chinese government

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
like the propaganda and the

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,918
misinformation spread by the

89
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
chinese state media and china's

90
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
diplomats

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
the other one is more tricky it is their

92
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
cover operation meaning the operations

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
cannot be directly attributed to the

94
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
chinese government

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
the actors of the cover operation will

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
be more aggressive

97
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
to spread this information conspiracy

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,759
series

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,759
and even perform toxin campaigns

100
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
for the past two years in these major

101
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
events like

102
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
2018 taiwan's vocal elections

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
2019 the hong kong protest

104
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,400
2020 taiwan's general election and

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,080
the coffee 19 pandemic we all identified

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,639
china's info of campaigns

107
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,560
our research have helped the journalism

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
and the social media platforms and many

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,479
research institutes

110
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,400
in these major events to better

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,919
understand china's

112
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
involves tactic technique and procedures

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
and in the past few months we are now

114
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
team up with our democratic partners

115
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,320
for the upcoming us 2020 election

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,039
here is an overview of taiwan's 2020

117
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
general election

118
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,080
2018 to 2020 taiwan has witnessed the

119
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
growing threat of this information

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,160
to our citizens it was observed that

121
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
many malicious actors

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
utilize social media to disseminate

123
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
a huge amount of fake news false

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,039
information

125
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,159
and even hate speech

126
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
according to the taiwanese government

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
the disinformation cases

128
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,039
have reached the highest number in this

129
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
2020 election

130
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,639
the taiwanese central election

131
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,400
commission cec

132
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,280
state that there are

133
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,880
128 disinformation cases

134
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,319
targeting this election in addition to

135
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,880
the evolution in quantity and tactics

136
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,720
we believe that the dissemination of

137
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
this information did not stop

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,639
after this election

139
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
so where did this information come from

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
when we look at all the disinformation

141
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
cases on

142
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
the major sms in taiwan such as

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,039
facebook twitter youtube and mine

144
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
we discovered that many of land was

145
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
started from the chinese sms

146
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,039
like waveform and wechat

147
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,280
maybe this is because taiwan has a

148
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
historical and cultural relationship

149
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,880
with china

150
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
which makes the nation in the two

151
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,000
regions

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,039
become highly entangled this is the

153
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,360
possible scenario however

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
in some cases we are also identified

155
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,319
the contents are directly copied from

156
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,599
the official website of chinese military

157
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
or they will directly amplify the

158
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,280
propaganda

159
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
made by the chinese government

160
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
taiwan's polarized political environment

161
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
and tribal relationships with the

162
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
chinese government

163
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
make taiwan a primary target for trying

164
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,800
not in for

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
up in this following section we will

166
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,479
leave

167
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
sylvia to talk about the ttp of china's

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,919

171
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
china's infowa

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,919
ttp is a very frequent term in cyber

173
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,120
security

174
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
it means tactic techniques and procedure

175
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
due to the time limit today i will only

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
talk about

177
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
three methods used in china's info ops

178
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,000
which are the propaganda machine

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,720
political content farm and spam botnet

180
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
and the mobilization of patriotic

181
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
netizens

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,560
to start with the chinese propaganda

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
machine has built significant presence

184
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
over social media platforms

185
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,080
in recent years the chinese propaganda

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,640
machine

187
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,519
consists of the state media embassies

188
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
and diplomat

189
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,320
studies show that they have spent a lot

190
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,640
in

191
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,040
advertisement to boost their engagement

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,839
on social media platforms

193
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
to name a few in this june the united

194
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,519
states

195
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,560
justice department published a report

196
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
that disclosed state media china daily

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
has spent about 11 million us dollar

198
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,480
on ads in the u.s newspaper

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
including the new york times wall street

200
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,080
journal

201
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,120
foreign policy and etc

202
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
and over 260 000

203
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
us dollar was spent for advertising

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
over twitter so china's heavy spending

205
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,080
on

206
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
advertisement has boosted their

207
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,680
influence in both

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
traditional media environment and the

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
social media platforms

210
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,279
this result in a very significant

211
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,040
numbers

212
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
let's look at the world's famous media

213
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,839
outlets followers on facebook

214
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,200
currently china runs 5 out of 6

215
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
media outlets with the highest number of

216
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,680
facebook following

217
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,519
which is the cgtn china daily

218
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
people's daily xinhua news and global

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
times

220
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
even the bbc news is behind them

221
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
the number one on the list cgtn

222
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,800
which is the english version of cctv

223
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,480
has over 100 million followers

224
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,519
cgtn also ranked the fourth among the

225
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,079
most

226
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,680
followed pages on facebook the stat is

227
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,040
really shocking

228
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,399
because back in 2014

229
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
none of the chinese state media had more

230
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
than 3 million fans

231
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,720
we know that by having a large number of

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,440
likes

233
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
a media can actually look very quite

234
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
credible and genuine at first sight

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
so they can cause the audience tend to

236
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
believe their content

237
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
because they have such amount of likes

238
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,719
and followers

239
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,480
the reason why we have a great concern

240
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
on chinese propaganda machine on sns

241
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
is because they have a bad reputation of

242
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,480
spreading misinformation

243
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
and conspiracy theory since the outbreak

244
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
of the covet 19 pandemic

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
they have put a lot of efforts to

246
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
establish the image of

247
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
china as a global savior instead of a

248
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,240
troublemaker

249
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
so you can see the screenshot on the

250
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,079
left is hua chunying

251
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,279
tweeted a video by people's daily

252
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
which showed the italians singing

253
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,640
chinese anthem in rome

254
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,839
that video was labeled as misinformation

255
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
by fact-check center

256
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,560
because the chinese anthem was actually

257
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,279
later

258
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,839
edited into into the video in the

259
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
post-production

260
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
so on the right hand side is the chinese

261
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
embassy in italy

262
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
it posted a lot of tweets praising

263
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
china's donation

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
of mass and supply to italy

265
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
yet it was later revealed that those

266
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
supplies were actually purchased

267
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
by the italian government instead of a

268
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
generous donation

269
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,240
not to mention john lee jin a chinese

270
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
diplomat who has been promoting the

271
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
conspiracy theory

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,200
of u.s army brought the coronavirus

273
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
to wuhan

274
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,600
next political content farm and spam

275
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
botnet has become the amplifier of

276
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
propaganda machine

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,720
in this year the most popular western

278
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,399
social media platforms

279
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,279
including facebook twitter and google

280
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,000
announced that

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
they haven't removed hundreds of

282
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,920
thousands of fake accounts

283
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
linked to china according to twitter

284
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
this pro-china accounts were involved in

285
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,639
manipulative

286
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
and coordinated activities they spread

287
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
geopolitical narrative favorable to a

288
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
chinese communist party

289
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,880
and push deceptive narrative about

290
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
political dynamic in hong kong

291
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,200
even though the platforms are already so

292
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
dedicated

293
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
to remove the propaganda network we

294
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,600
still observe

295
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,399
a considerable amount of accounts

296
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,639
continue to boost the narrative of the

297
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,760
chinese government

298
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,120
across the sns

299
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,079
so here i will show you an example of

300
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
how the spam botnet and content form

301
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
amplify the content of chinese state

302
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
media

303
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
one of the main themes in the chinese

304
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
propaganda

305
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,279
is attacking the trump administration

306
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,959
so on august 15 the xinhua news

307
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,880
posted an article titled the

308
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,040
politicization

309
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,839
of covet 19 gets us trapped in deep

310
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,480
trouble

311
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
you can see the highlighted sentences in

312
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
the article

313
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,639
was later become the material for spam

314
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,279
botnet

315
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
and content farm

316
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
on august 16 the article was first

317
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,440
copied

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
and shared by a notorious chinese

319
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
content farm called

320
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
kk news mayuri tautil and then the text

321
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,320
from the article

322
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
was spread across facebook and twitter

323
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,800
via spamming accounts we found that

324
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
this account shows strong signs of

325
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
automatic behavior

326
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
because they simultaneously posted

327
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,639
numerous identical

328
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
contents on a daily basis and their

329
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
content are mostly copied from chinese

330
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
state media

331
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,560
and chinese sns such as weibo

332
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
also we observed that some of the

333
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,440
accounts in the botnets

334
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
use mug shots as profile picture

335
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,279
these mugshots are often available on

336
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,160
online forums and dark web

337
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
so from the screenshot you can see the

338
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,040
spam.net simultaneously share videos

339
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,079
that criticize

340
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
the crowd the trump administration

341
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,079
emphasizing

342
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
the incompetence of the us government to

343
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
handle the pandemic

344
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,320
you can see the spam botnet use mug

345
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,399
shots as profile picture

346
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,600
and more importantly their username were

347
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
made to look like u.s citizens

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
such as harmony beckett holy padilla

349
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,639
rebecca moore clone ramises etc etc

350
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,440
so we also spotted some cross-platform

351
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,720
activities

352
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
here's the screenshot of botnets

353
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
spamming a video that accuses

354
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
trump of dictatorship on youtube

355
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,240
facebook

356
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,959
and twitter you can see that the video

357
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
content and the caption

358
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,920
are 100 percent identical

359
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
and again our investigation found that

360
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,720
the source of content was from

361
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,120
chinax.com which is a national news site

362
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,800
controlled by a party media outlet

363
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,759
this shows that not only do these spam

364
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,560
botnets

365
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,519
spread texts and images but they also

366
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,920
disseminate video content

367
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,560
and this is harder for the authority and

368
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,519
researcher

369
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,920
to detect the disinformation campaign

370
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,320
the next one is the mobilization of

371
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
patriotic medicine

372
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
patriotic netizens also known as the

373
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,399
little pink

374
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
are notorious for launching trolling

375
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
campaigns against foreign online users

376
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
when they feel china is being attacked

377
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,320
by bias reporting

378
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,880
the chinese authority have recognized

379
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,199
the power of the patriotic

380
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,639
netizens sometimes the regime

381
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,959
will deliberately mobilize them to

382
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,399
attack the dissidents

383
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,079
so last year they have mobilized the

384
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,800
patriotic medicine to launch a doxing

385
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,519
campaign

386
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,720
against the hong kong protester

387
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,759
for your information doxxing is the

388
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,399
action

389
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,599
to search for and publish the private

390
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,400
information

391
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,799
about a particular individual on the

392
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,919
internet

393
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,720
typically is with malicious intent

394
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,160
so the context is in the late august

395
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
there was an anonymous website that

396
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,439
disclosed

397
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
personal details of the hong kong

398
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,160
protester

399
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799
so on the right hand side is is the

400
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,679
screenshot

401
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,360
of the website the website describes the

402
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
protesters

403
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,280
as troublemakers and foreign agents

404
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,200
aiming to destroy the hong kong

405
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
stability

406
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
later in mid-september the chinese state

407
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,880
media

408
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
led by cctv posted a video on weibo to

409
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
promote the website

410
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
and then the post by cctv

411
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
was widely shared and promoted by

412
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
official accounts

413
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,600
of the chinese authority

414
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
eventually they successfully inflamed

415
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
the patriotic chinese netizens

416
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,440
many led netizens have joined the

417
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
narrative and demanded those protesters

418
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
to review that

419
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,559
their true identity

420
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,840
they launched several hashtag campaigns

421
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,039
on weibo

422
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
such as i dare you to pull off your mass

423
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,799
and take off your mass movement

424
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,120
this has posed a great threat to the

425
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
protester

426
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
because if they are identified

427
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,160
they could face a lawful punishment from

428
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,600
the chinese government

429
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,919
team p5 called this unique and

430
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
organizational mechanism

431
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,039
as digital propaganda formula which is

432
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,840
made up of four key components

433
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,039
namely state media governmental affairs

434
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,160
new media

435
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,000
communist youth lee and trolling army

436
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
we believe the regime has used this

437
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,039
formula

438
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,600
to influence and mobilize the country's

439
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,480
netizen

440
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,400
when they want to shape the online

441
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,520
discourse in favor of china

442
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
one notable example is the cross-strait

443
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
online disputes

444
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
in 2016. that is the time

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,720
when pro-democracy candidate sy in one

446
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
was elected

447
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,880
and the chinese name patriotic netizen

448
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
were mobilized to challenge

449
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
taiwan's election result

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
you may think the above-mentioned cases

451
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,760
are serious enough

452
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,799
however the situation can get worse when

453
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,000
hackers enter the info of that landscape

454
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
and we call it an apt plus info of

455
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,400
attack model advanced persistent

456
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
threat apt actors are typically

457
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
state-sponsored hacker groups

458
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
they usually conduct prolonged and

459
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
targeted cyber attacks to steal highly

460
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,400
sensitive data

461
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
however in mid-july 2020 we identify

462
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
an info up that can be linked to a

463
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,320
notorious chinese apt

464
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,600
group we doubt the involved as operation

465
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,480
juker

466
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
because the threat actor had

467
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,000
disseminated this information about

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
juker

469
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,120
which is a messaging app developed by

470
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,679
taiwan's research institute

471
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
the app is also widely used by

472
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
government units

473
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,520
so the actor claimed the juker app and

474
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
the research institute were hacked

475
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
and many confidential data about

476
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,880
military unit

477
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,200
or expose operation juker took place

478
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
on ptt which is a popular reddit light

479
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
forum in taiwan

480
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
ptt has a special feature the forum will

481
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
display the ip address of the author of

482
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,039
a post

483
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,120
we found that the actor had controlled

484
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
about 20 taiwanese ips and 50 ptt

485
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,600
accounts to spread the disinformation

486
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,440
many of the accounts owner

487
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,159
had later claimed claimed that they have

488
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:04,559
never

489
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,080
posted an article about juker

490
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
what's noteworthy is that we conducted

491
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,840
an investigation

492
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
to cross-reference the ip address in

493
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,960
this operation with our database

494
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,760
and we found one of the ips overlapped

495
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,960
the c2 server

496
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
of a chinese state sponsor apt group

497
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
which we have tracked for years

498
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
so the model we think the model is more

499
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,440
sophisticated

500
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,520
because a typical hack and leak

501
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,559
operation

502
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
is just a well-timed dump of stolen data

503
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,200
yet apt plus info could involve

504
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
targeted social media campaigns

505
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
disseminating this information

506
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
based on highly confidential data

507
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,520
such situation is super tricky for

508
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,360
government units and fact check

509
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,240
centers and it could pose a great risk

510
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,840
of national security

511
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
so we think it is more crucial than ever

512
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,120
to adopt threat intelligence solution to

513
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
combat the issue

514
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
our research has shown that these actors

515
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
will keep evolving

516
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,679
and changing their tactics over times

517
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,080
with knowledge in cyber security and the

518
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
ecosystem of

519
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
sns we believe our threat intelligence

520
