14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
personally i always have this one big

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,920
question in mind

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,119
so what if you and i we put

17
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
some sort of our personal files on the

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,840
internet openly

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
and then we just let it there for maybe

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,200
um 90 days what will happen to them

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
this is always the big question in my

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
mind and eventually this form

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,360
so-called the fundamental for these uh

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,040
big interesting topics right here

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,840
uh who stole my hundred thousand dollars

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,479
worth

27
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,119
of uh bitcoin wallet so ladies and

28
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,759
gentlemen

29
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
uh definitely for the next 30 minutes we

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
are going to explore about

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,119
this uh behind the scenes story about

32
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,079
how

33
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,159
we try to let our hundred thousand

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,000
dollars worth of bitcoin wallet

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
to be stolen and some sort of other

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
interesting story behind the scene

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
yeah so we'll we'll explore about uh

38
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
three things right here

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
so first let's try to explore about this

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,520
new tool

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
namely honeybank which we created for

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,319
these particular purposes

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,360
and then uh secondly where we put and

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
how we put all these kind of files

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,400
on the internet yeah last but not least

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
the most interesting part

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,720
uh what happened to all of them all

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,120
these

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
bitcoin wallet that we push on the

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,599
internet for 90 days

51
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,360
well um let's do this together

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
nowadays uh internet security research

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,239
company

54
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,519
scanning the entire internet for on

55
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,239
those kind of

56
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
insecure configured web server and then

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
a lot of brain behind the scene

58
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,440
uh thinking of how can we secure it

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,239
nicely

60
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,040
because those servers expose sensitive

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,760
information

62
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,879
on the internet um also the bad guy the

63
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,920
other side of the wall

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
they did the same they are looking at

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
the same

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
exposed informations on the internet and

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
they are continuing to harvest

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
those kind of data which interests

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,840
them the most for example if they

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
try to compromise one of the server they

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
can go into into the environment

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
looking for juicy information it could

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
be

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,400
credited credit card details company

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
business plan

76
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
some sensitive or confidential data

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,319
which are not supposed to be exposed to

78
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,440
the internet

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
well um this will be the same analogy as

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,640
um

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,879
could be one of the streets uh teeth

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
which is they carrying antibac

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
or try to crash into a certain

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
environment

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
sneaky snake into that and then fill

86
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
with the bag with all those kind of

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
jewelry for example gold silver

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
all the valuable things they will carry

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,159
that full bag

90
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
just to try to sneak out the from the

91
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,280
premise

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
well in the laws of movie we will see

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
that hey somebody tried to put a gps

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
tracker into those kind of bag so when

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,640
the teeth

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
transport the bag from one single

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
location into another single locations

98
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,560
this a gps tracker will give us a small

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
little

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
ping or they will reveal some sort of a

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
certain informations about the track

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,040
about the attackers behind the scenes

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
well um

104
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,360
this is definitely the approach that we

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
are going to go for today

106
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,600
about honey token approach about the bid

107
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
approach

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
yeah and let's try to start this with a

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,759
real

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,960
live example together oh

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,639
back in 2017 thanks to mr dd steven

112
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
one of the very well-known squid

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
professionals um

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,240
created this a very interesting blog on

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,199
a sans

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
uh blog post uh mr st leader stephen

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,840
during that time he started to see a lot

118
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
of

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
malicious internet scanning try to

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,680
pickpocket

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,280
bitcoin wallet from his web server well

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
end of 2017 bitcoin

123
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,280
price is all time higher i believe that

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,840
the whole world is really crazy about it

125
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
everyone would like to get a small

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
little bitcoin because

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,560
it really caused a lot of value and then

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
back then

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
malicious internet scanning

130
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
happened all the time people are looking

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,840
for

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,199
exposed um bitcoin wallet

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,919
on the internet so well um mr dieter

134
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
stevens start to observe

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
certain pattern from those kind of a

136
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
scanning pattern

137
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
and eventually those kind of patterns

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
came back after a couple of months

139
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
from months to months um i like his

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
web server lock which i posted on this

141
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
screen right now

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,639
let's take a quick look together what's

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,080
happened in this

144
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,120
web server well

145
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
um what you have seen on the screen

146
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
right now this is the web server log

147
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
belongs to

148
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,280
mr didier stephen's domain

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
this is uh personally i would like to

150
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
say that this is a very beautiful

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,039
and very sexy um web server log

152
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,560
um in order to read this the very easy

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
way will be

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
uh at the most left column it is a

155
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
ip address if followed by the time stamp

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
and then followed by the http cad method

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,520
again if followed by the uri and then

158
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
the http response code such as 404

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,199
and eventually they followed by the user

160
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
agent itself so this is a very easy way

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
that how can we read this

162
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
nicely but just in brief um

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
somebody is trying was trying his luck

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
and try to guess about the correct

165
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
wallet's name

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
on mr didier stephen's uh web server

167
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
well of course uh he or she will

168
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
will was hit with a 404 hdb

169
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,319
respawn code because there was no

170
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
uh bitcoin wallet over uh over there

171
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,520
oh but what uh catch our attention the

172
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,319
most

173
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,039
is uh those patterns that how they scan

174
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,880
for those kind of bitcoin wallet

175
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
so let's take a quick look together

176
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
in a very common uh crypto wallet name

177
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,680
it could be commonly known as a

178
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,240
wallet.dat

179
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,759
or wallet underscore backup.d8t this is

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,000
just

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,240
a very common file name for crypto

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,199
wallet

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,520
and then somehow the bad guys try to

184
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
scan for

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,599
the zip file which contain the bitcoin

186
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,400
wallet

187
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
in namely wallet.zip or wallet

188
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
or bags back and backup slash wallet

189
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,560
does it

190
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
in this case uh as honeyball researchers

191
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
as honey tokens uh

192
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,840
hobbies uh i have this a big question in

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
mind as well what if

194
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
we can feed the guy the bad guy with the

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,639
information that

196
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,680
they need with certain fake content

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
eventually when they start to open up

198
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,879
the zip file

199
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
unzip the zip file try to assess the

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
content with it

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
this will gather some sort of

202
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,080
information about a bad guy

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,039
back to us this is one of the very

204
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,400
fundamental idea

205
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
and uh eventually this idea turned into

206
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
this new tool which we named it as

207
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,759
a honeyback

208
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,120
well let me introduce to you honeyback a

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
tools

210
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,799
that help you to create a bid

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,000
archive it could be a zip file with any

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,399
folders and name any folders and files

213
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
embedded in it

214
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,640
it will notify you if someone access it

215
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
will believe that

216
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
these tools will be very useful for data

217
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,120
breach

218
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
detections or deceptions defense

219
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,440
defense mechanism mechanism later let's

220
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
take a quick look together

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
how it works well

222
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
i will say that first honeyback contains

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,920
three different components common one

224
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,640
will be

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
this is a honeyback client second

226
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
component will be a simple dns server

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,279
the third component will be optional

228
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
which is uh we can set up

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,600
a responder in order to work with a

230
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
honeyback together

231
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
so for honeyback client this is just a

232
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,730
very simple

233
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,920
[Music]

234
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,959
python script we can easily generate one

235
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,839
single zip file or many zip file

236
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,640
together

237
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
and this this kind of zip file it can

238
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
contain it contains

239
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
any embedded folder files for example

240
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
document pdf or any text files that you

241
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,480
name it

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
you can have it definitely

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
what i want to emphasize right here is

244
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,000
the final zip file

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,040
how it looks like

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
yeah so on the screen right here on the

247
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,640
right screen right here this is one of

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
the example or the zip file

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,120
that we created in this case this zip

250
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
file namely secret.zip

251
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
it contains a folder called secret

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,680
folder

253
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
well you just only have a one single pdf

254
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,360
file

255
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,600
in it namely supersecret document.pdf

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
well during the creation process

257
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
honeymac will automatically

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
automatically slot two different files

259
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,440
into it

260
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
first will be the first one uh with the

261
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,839
file extensions dot url

262
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,279
second will be the file extent file name

263
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,000
desktop.ini

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,720
both files will serve as the alerting

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
mechanism in this case

266
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
for our honeyback while these two files

267
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
are pretty commonly found

268
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
in a windows operating system such as

269
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
windows 7

270
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
or windows stand yeah

271
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,079
initially both of the files with the

272
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,399
legend made purpose

273
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
they have they serve their own purpose

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,600
such as

275
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,320
desktop.ini is the one that will control

276
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,839
how

277
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
a folder will be displayed on the

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
windows explorer

279
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
for example we can customize the icon

280
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
for it we can customize the info tip

281
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
which is such as uni we can move our

282
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
mouse our computer mouse definitely

283
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,959
yeah just go to the folder and then the

284
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
folder will show us about the info tips

285
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,600
yeah secondly about the dot url

286
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,399
internet shortcut files this is meant

287
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,079
for convenient purpose

288
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,120
if someone created this file if we

289
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
double click on it

290
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
it will link us to the particular http

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
url legitimate one yeah it's just mainly

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
for convenient purpose

293
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,279
but definitely this two file is very

294
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,320
useful for as

295
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,519
a loading mechanism and i would like to

296
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
thanks this uh to

297
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
things uh can we token for found out

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
this particular very interesting

299
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,160
technique

300
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,480
yeah both files will try to look for

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
their icon file locally into a maybe c

302
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,639
windows

303
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,320
directory but what if we can try to

304
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,800
tweak

305
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,079
these internal resources into external

306
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,120
resources

307
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,279
we'll try to redirect desktop.ini

308
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,440
on.url look for the icon file

309
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
on the external locations yeah in this

310
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,639
case the external locations could be

311
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
a domain sitting outside out there or it

312
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,560
could be an ib

313
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
address that is sitting somewhere on the

314
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
internet well in this case

315
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
this can form a very interesting

316
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,440
alerting mechanism in this case well

317
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
so now the big questions what if

318
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,000
someone try to download the secret or

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,880
zip file

320
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
unzip it and click into the secret

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,120
folder what will happen in this case

322
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,519
in this case once it unzip the file

323
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,480
try to access into the folder itself

324
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,279
these actions will automatically trigger

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
two alert mechanism which we well

326
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
defined right here

327
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
the desktop.ini will reach out to our

328
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
simple.dns domain

329
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
domain and it will talk to our simple

330
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
dns

331
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
server so our server will start to log

332
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,959
those kind of incoming requests

333
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,959
and log in nicely in the sqlite logging

334
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,440
so for the second alert mechanism which

335
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,399
is dot url

336
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,360
in this case the internet shortcut file

337
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
will try to reach out to the ip address

338
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
which we can set up a responder on it

339
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,040
and in this case we can start to collect

340
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
ntrm hashes

341
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
or ntm2 v2 hashes for

342
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,720
latest analytic purpose well

343
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,959
in this case in overall we'll collect

344
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,639
we'll collect various pieces

345
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,120
of information such as the source ip

346
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
address

347
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,279
those uh from the dns traffics we can

348
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,399
collect

349
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,639
username computer name domain name

350
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,880
from the responder we can collect the

351
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,079
ntm hashes

352
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,079
v2 or versions one hashes all of these

353
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,920
can eventually draw up to be a very

354
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
interesting pictures for analysis later

355
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,079
well just one small little caveat right

356
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,160
here or limitations right here

357
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
currently the alerting mechanism will be

358
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,199
only applicable

359
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
for windows because it is highly relying

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,760
on the unc

361
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,839
path tricks and technique

362
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,680
well if someone try to

363
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
download the secret.zip file open the

364
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,120
zip file on a linux or osx

365
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
operating system well this will it won't

366
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,040
trigger any

367
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
alerts back to us but uh in the future

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,320
developments

369
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
we hope that we can have uh some sort of

370
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
better techniques

371
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
for linux and oss operating system

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,519
if any time you came across with this

373
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,120
kind of interesting technique

374
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
for both of these two operating system

375
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,160
feel free to reach out to us yeah

376
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,079
well right now we have this uh

377
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,040
honey bags on hand yeah so the next

378
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
questions will be

379
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
how can we use and use it and get the

380
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,920
best

381
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
out of it yeah we try to

382
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,279
explore about different use cases and

383
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
after a lot of discussions and a lot of

384
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
thought process behind the scenes

385
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,880
we came up with this one very

386
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
interesting idea as a

387
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,880
everybody loves bitcoin yeah

388
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,320
so what if

389
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,560
we put a ten thousand hundred thousand

390
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
dollars worth of a bitcoin wallet

391
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,480
on the internet for 90 days

392
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
what will happen to all of them yeah

393
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
um definitely in this case uh i don't

394
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,480
have a hundred thousand dollars worth of

395
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
bitcoin wallet right here i really wish

396
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
that i have

397
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,959
if you are going to donate it to me i'm

398
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,680
i will be

399
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
very appreciative of it thank you very

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,420
much in advance

401
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,279
[Laughter]

402
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,800
but well in this case um we start to

403
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
look for this very interesting

404
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
alternative called btc testing

405
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,680
the bitcoin test net

406
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,240
well we we start to create a ten

407
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
different uh bitcoin wallet right here

408
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
uh each of them will be unprotected and

409
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,399
they will contain one

410
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
btc test net well the main differences

411
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,759
between

412
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
btc testnet and btc

413
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
is a both of them um

414
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,720
is they they have the same underlying

415
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
technology which is a bitcoin

416
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
but then btc testnet is mainly for

417
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
the use of development purpose if

418
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,759
someone would like to test

419
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,600
build applications with bitcoin

420
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
transactions they can use btc testnet

421
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,560
you know

422
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,759
in order to test it nicely well

423
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,280
btc btc testnet don't have any

424
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,160
um exact value on it the value itself is

425
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,760
just a test value

426
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,000
you can't really uh exchange btc test

427
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
and value to the

428
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,640
real us dollar in this case um

429
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
bt standard testnet can be obtained from

430
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,559
a loss of faucet

431
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,640
on the internet so one i would suggest

432
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,760
that once you

433
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
finish it please translate transfer it

434
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,880
back

435
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,799
to the forces because uh it will be very

436
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,120
helpful for the community to

437
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,679
to use it another main difference

438
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,000
between btc testnet and testnet

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,280
and btc is a btc

440
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
both of them they will have a different

441
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,400
prefix in the

442
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
bitcoin address but

443
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
the wallet itself they are pretty

444
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
similar i mean in terms of the

445
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
structures and general stuff

446
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,679
so in this case once we created all this

447
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,360
kind of 10 btc

448
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,720
bitcoin water and we start to push it

449
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
on the internet on different open

450
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,559
directories

451
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,679
uh web servers in this case we just try

452
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,120
to build in the same

453
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,240
analogy as if someone leave wallet on

454
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
the streets

455
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
in the real life will the wallet get

456
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
stolen

457
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,400
or will will it stay intact over there

458
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
for maybe after a while

459
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
or it could be someone just pick it up

460
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,520
and return it to you yeah

461
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
i mean this is what we are trying to

462
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,039
explore in this case

463
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,559
and um of course it's also about

464
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,480
wallet itself water is always a very

465
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
sensitive thing

466
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
it's just about a place or the

467
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
placeholder with a lot of cash

468
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
which are a credit card some sort of

469
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
personal identity card

470
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
on it um definitely this will be very

471
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
interesting use case if you just push

472
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,120
a wallet out there openly on the

473
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
internet

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
and uh yeah this is what

475
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,760
we are trying to do so initially in the

476
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,400
very beginning

477
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,520
beginning of the experiment we

478
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
expect that our web server will be such

479
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
interesting as uh what mr didier steven

480
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,320
sing

481
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,360
on his web server

482
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,520
it's a wish full of a very sexy and

483
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,640
beautiful weblog

484
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
a lot of interactions people are trying

485
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,679
to find

486
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,120
to to grab the copy a copy

487
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
from your web server but in this case uh

488
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,200
this is the expectation but in reality

489
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
the reality is so disappointing

490
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
well um you know web server is just

491
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,320
so quiet all the time for many weeks

492
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,880
and uh from time to time we'll see some

493
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
of the cats

494
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,280
or fly

495
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,320
they fly into the web server and say hi

496
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,919
if we're lucky enough sometimes you'll

497
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,520
see googlebot

498
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,720
on bing's board we'll try to talk to our

499
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,760
web server that's all well it's really

500
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,559
disappointing

501
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,600
and we thought of this case this would

502
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
be a

503
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
one of the failure or the entire

504
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,159
use case it's just uh really

505
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,280
disappointing

506
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,919
yeah but uh definitely the first lesson

507
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,880
then

508
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,559
just be patient um after a while we

509
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,360
started a

510
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,480
think we still have to talk about more

511
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,760
proactive approach we start to

512
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,120
put some sort of message on page bin

513
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,320
for example hey buddy this is my

514
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,200
secret personal backup bitcoin wallet

515

521
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480

522
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,039
well ladies and gentlemen um within 90

523
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,600
days

524
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,200
all our 10 bitcoin wallet was stolen

525
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
and nine of them alert us with the teeth

526
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
informations

527
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
one of them is missing i suspect that

528
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
because of the

529
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,159
uh wallet was often uh

530
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
of view in a linux or osx

531
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,080
operating system um one of the very

532
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,880
interesting

533
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
observations would be the fastest record

534
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
for the stolen wallet

535
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,440
is less than one minute after we posted

536
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,080
it on

537
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,760
page bin well um let me share with you

538
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,000
about

539
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,640
one of the very interesting use case um

540
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
which we observed in a 90 days

541
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,320
as uh someone just totally wiped

542
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,840
out our btc test wallet

543
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,080
yep yeah this was uh happening

544
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,080
uh during uh march 23rd or march 24th

545
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
this year um initially we started to

546
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,600
push this

547
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,880
bitcoin wallet uh on our web server on

548
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,159
uh

549
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
march 23rd within less than 24 hours

550
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,799
surprisingly and unexpectedly the value

551
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,120
in

552
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,120
in our btc testness is totally empty

553
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,640
hey buddy this is just a btc testnet and

554
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,520
it don't have any exact value into it

555
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,600
it's just a test value

556
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,799
so i'm not sure why yeah but uh

557
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,400
let's try to take a look take a quick

558
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
look about a three component right here

559
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
first will be the web server second will

560
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,480
be the honeyback

561
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,559
dns alert and the third one will be the

562
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,960
responder

563
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,080
so um on march 24th

564
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,640
this year our wallet.zip file was stolen

565
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,320
on a 1440 utc um

566
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,919
these web server logs uh reveal the http

567
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
code will be 200 which indicates that

568
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,520
the connection is successful

569
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,840
he has managed to get a wallet zip file

570
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,240
from us

571
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,480
well two minutes afterwards we start to

572
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
observe

573
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
the dns alert in our honeyback dns

574
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,000
simple dns server for the dns query

575
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
you can see a very long dns query which

576
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,280
is uh

577
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
it has it contains a predefined

578
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,960
different column in this case

579
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,000
for example the first column will be is

580
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
filled with the

581
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,799
value as blue and this is the username

582
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
and then the second column will be the

583
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,080
desktop dash

584
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,640
followed by the string this is the

585
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,760
computer name

586
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,200
and then after that it followed by the

587
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,679
domain name itself this is how the

588
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,960
dns query works in this case

589
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
but from here it indicates that someone

590
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,360
really unzip our zip file and then

591
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
browse into the content itself yeah if

592
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
you try to correlate

593
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
with the third component which is the

594
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
responder part

595
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,720
um we can even uh sing about his uh

596
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
ntim v2 hashes under the responders

597
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,360
in this case the username is blue and

598
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,760
the

599
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
hostname itself is quite similar with

600
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
what we have seen just now

601
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,039
on the honeyback dns server yeah

602
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,200
so as a quick timeline overview

603
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,679
on march 24th 1440 utc

604
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,440
our wallet was stolen from the web

605
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,919
server two minutes afterward

606
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
we start to receive the first dn alerts

607
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,600
dns alert

608
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,720
in this case uh indicates that he or she

609
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
assess our wallet.zip file

610
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,919
after a while the smb alerts appear in

611
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,679
our responder log

612
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,720
so from the first minute that

613
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,000
our wallet the zip file was stolen after

614
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
35 minutes

615
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,799
he or she transferred the entire value

616
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,720
in our btc test network to another btc

617
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,679
test

618
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,120
addresses um i'm not sure why he did

619
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,240
that or

620
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
maybe he's found about what we do and he

621
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,080
just feels so

622
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,780
pissed off about what we have done

623
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,600
[Laughter]

624
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,679
well well definitely this is a very

625
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,799
interesting

626
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,880
learning experience yeah in this case

627
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
about how uh we can use a

628
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,919
honey bag in terms of a cyber defense uh

629
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:18,960
perspective

630
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,279
yeah there's a couple of uh do and

631
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,559
don'ts about

632
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,320
our lesson learned so first of all

633
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,039
be patient yeah it's always a pain and a

634
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,440
fun

635
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,679
for honeypot researchers or honey token

636
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,120
practitioners

637
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
definitely it's always take time until

638
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,360
the exact great moment that we can

639
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,320
harvest a good

640
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,600
result in this case well i would suggest

641
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
that

642
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
customize your own unique deceptive bait

643
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
the more unique it is i believe that uh

644
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
it will give us a better result or

645
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,520
perspective in the long run

646
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,080
i was also suggest to put up a warning

647
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,559
message

648
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,480
or banner such as a hey buddy this is

649
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
our personal

650
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,440
files proprietary files or companies

651
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,720
secret folders

652
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,919
um you are not allowed to download this

653
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,760
but uh well uh i guess people

654
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
some people maybe don't care and yeah

655
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,080
eventually they can this can leave

656
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
leaders to some sort of interesting

657
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
story behind the scene

658
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,200
last but not least we'll be uh never

659
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,960
underestimate about the great impact of

660
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
this

661
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,200
uh initially our approach is mainly for

662
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,520
windows purposes

663
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,880
but who knows nine of the 10

664
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
of our bitcoin wallet file

665
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,039
came back with certain thief information

666
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,000
back to us

667
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
yeah so um honey bags
