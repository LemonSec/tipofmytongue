our next session is

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,800
privacy protection and data breach

3
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
incident response regulation

4
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
in east asia and europe please welcome

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,000

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
start our presentation of privacy

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
protection and data breach

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
incident response regulation in east

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,239
asia

12
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,039
and europe

13
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
joy i work in light cooperation as a

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
privacy council

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
and majoring in information security and

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,720
data protection law

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
my partner is weak an application

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
security engineer

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
who is working mainly on web security

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
and blockchain security

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
there is our agenda this paper starts

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
from the regulation of taiwan japan and

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,159
thailand

24
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
including the personal information

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
definition

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,759
and the comparison of data bridge

27
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,000
incident response regulations in the

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
three countries you can see the legal

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
trend of data protection

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,159
in east asia also

31
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,880
since the thailand data protection law

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
is quite similar to the general data

33
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,840
protection

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,080
regulation of european union

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
which is known as gdpr

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,239
this far-reaching data protection rules

37
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,640
and the risk-driven type of legal

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
requirements

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
are also introduced to you

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
followed will be the topic data bridge

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,319
incidents in real world we will show you

42
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,200
how the enterprises handle the data

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,760
bridge

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
incidents and if their handling process

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
is confined to the regulations in their

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
jurisdiction

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
the final part is our suggestions of

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
data breach incident response

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
this paper narrows down the topics in

50
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,200
the scope of personal data breach

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
incident response here are the four

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,360
issues

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
i shall a transnational enterprise do

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,599
while the personal data breach has

55
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
happened

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
how could the company interact with the

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
data subjects

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
does the company have legal obligation

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
to report the data breach to

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,239
governmental authorities or

61
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,159
any other stakeholders what is the

62
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
international chance of the incident

63
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,760
response mechanism

64
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
we are trying to reply to the four

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
issues we are analyzing the legal

66
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,280
requirements

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
and the recent practices in different

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
countries

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
we are going to start from introducing

70
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
the definition of

71
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,879
personal data first of all in taiwan

72
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,080
the article 2.1 of taiwan pdpa

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
has ruled that personal data

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
is defined as any information that may

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
be used to

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,239
directly or indirectly identify

77
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
a natural person for example a natural

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
person's name

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,159
date of birth id card number

80
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,519
passport number fingerprint

81
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
family information education background

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,440
criminal records contact information

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,199
financial conditions and so on

84
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
also in japan the personal information

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
is defined as

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,280
information about the living individual

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
our sufficient to distinguish

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
specific individuals based on the name

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,280
and birth month

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
contained in the information

91
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,479
descriptions

92
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,880
including the personal information which

93
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
could be used to identify individuals

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
by making different information

95
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,040
in eu article 4 of gdpr wrote that

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
personal data means any information

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
related to

98
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
an identified or identifiable natural

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,239
person

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
known as data subject

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
in thailand highland pdpa defines

102
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,080
personal data as

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
any information relating to a person

104
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,240
which enables the identification

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
of a person either directly or

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,080
indirectly

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,880
but does not include the information of

108
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,680
diseased

109
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,240
persons

110
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
i'm now introducing the regulation of

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
personal data breach

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
first of all you can notice that taiwan

113
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,199
pvpa defines personal data bridge

114
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
as any personal data is stolen

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,840
is closed altered or otherwise

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,919
infringed upon due to a violation of the

117
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,120
pdpa

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
by a government or non-government agency

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,400
also there are other regulations ruled

120
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
how to handle the personal data bridge

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
especially the obligation to notify data

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
subjects

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,960
i will introduce them later

124
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,199
in japan there are no specific legal

125
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,000
requirements

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,319
regulating how to handle personal data

127
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,840
breach

128
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,199
in european union personal data bridge

129
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
has been divided as three categories

130
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
including confidentiality bridge

131
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,800
availability bridge

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
integrity breach

133
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,440
confidentiality refers to protecting

134
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,759
information from being assessed by

135
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,440
unauthorized parties in other words

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,000
only the people who are authorized to do

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,639
so can

138
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,759
get access to those data

139
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
imaging your bank records you should be

140
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
able to assess them

141
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,319
and the employers at the bank who are

142
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,599
helping you with a

143
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
transaction should be able to access

144
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,960
them

145
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,000
but no one else should a failure to

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
maintain confidentiality means that

147
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,560
someone

148
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
who shouldn't have access could gather

149
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
data

150
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
through intentional behavior or by

151
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
accident

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
availability means that information is

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,759
accessible

154
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,199
by authorizer users

155
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
value of availability such as denial of

156
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,919
service

157
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,479
or bring down the server making the

158
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,520
website unavailable to legitimate users

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,840
integrity refers to ensuring the

160
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,919
authenticity of information

161
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
that information is not altered and that

162
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,360
the source of the information is genuine

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
in thailand the pdp rule that

164
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,160
in the event of a data breach data

165
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,039
controllers

166
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,240
must report the bridge to the regulator

167
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
without undue delay and in any event

168
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,919
without 72 hours

169
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
of becoming aware of it

170
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
now i'm going to show you the comparison

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
of data bridge

172
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,720
incident response regulation

173
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,479
i will start from taiwan japan then eu

174
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,120
and thailand article 12 of taiwan pdp

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
wrote that if personal data breach

176
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,880
happened

177
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
the data subject shall be notified via

178
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
appropriate means

179
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
after the relevant facts has been

180
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
clarified

181
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,880
article 22 of enforcement rules

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,000
of the pdpa also rules that

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
a notification given via appropriate

184
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,519
means

185
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
shall be understood as a notification

186
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,800
that is given

187
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
in a prompt manner via verbal words

188
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,959
in writing over the phone via

189
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
text messages email fax

190
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
electronic documents or any other means

191
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
that can effectively make the

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,880
information

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,040
known or available to the data subjects

194
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
however if such notification costs

195
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
too much taking into consideration

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
the technical visibility and privacy

197
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
protection

198
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,880
a data collector may notify the data

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,680
subjects

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,800
through the internet the media or

201
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
other proper and public means for

202
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
example

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
the newspapers or the website

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,800
the content of notification shall

205
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
include the facts

206
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
pertaining to the data breach and the

207
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,399
response measures already adopted to

208
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:52,959
address

209
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,320
such bridge of personal data

210
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,560
there is no exceptional situations

211
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,519
once the data breach happened there is

212
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,240
already

213
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
a legal obligation to notify this data

214
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
subject

215
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
it doesn't matter if the bridge is risky

216
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
to the data subject

217
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,359
or not

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
you may notice that there are no

219
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,560
relevant articles

220
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,959
about the data breach incidence response

221
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,760
regulation

222
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,440
in japan it is not legally required

223
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
to report a data breach incident through

224
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
the personal information protection

225
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
commission

226
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,760
known as a ppc or to notify the relevant

227
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
data subjects

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
however the ppc issued guideline

229
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
recommending that

230
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
this notification be made and it is a

231
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
market standards practice

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,320
to report data breach incident in japan

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
not doing so and instead having the

234
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
bridge discovered publicly

235
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
would have a potentially massive

236
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,800
negative impact

237
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,200
on brand image and reputation

238
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
in addition the ppc guidelines provide

239
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
the companies three suggestions

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,959
one make necessary investigations

241
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,360
and take any necessary preventive

242
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,800
measures

243
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
two make public the natural of the

244
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,800
bridge

245
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
and steps taken to rectify the problem

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,760
three send a voluntary notice to the

247
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
data subject

248
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,399
of the bridge or publish the data bridge

249
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,560
if appropriate and necessary

250
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,399
also if a factual situation demonstrates

251
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,120
that

252
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
the personal data is not actually

253
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,959
disclosed

254
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,760
the notice to the ppc or any other

255
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,399
relevant

256
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,079
authority is not necessary for

257
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
example if the company has

258
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,720
encrypted the data or otherwise secured

259
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
the data in such a way

260
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
that it has become useless to the third

261
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
parties

262
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
it is not necessary to do any

263
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,720
notification

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,880
by european union if a data breach

265
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
occurs

266
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
and it is likely that it poses a risk to

267
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
an individual's rights and freedom

268
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
the data controller has to notify the

269
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,240
supervisory authority

270
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,680
without undue delay and and the lattice

271
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
within 72 hours

272
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,200
after having become aware of the bridge

273
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
if it is the data process of being aware

274
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,839
of the data breach

275
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,720
the data processor must notify the data

276
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,279
bridge to the data controller

277
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,320
if the data bridge poses a high risk to

278
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
those individuals affected then they

279
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
should also be

280
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,760
informed unless there are effective

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
technical and organizational potential

282
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
measures

283
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
that have been put in place or other

284
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,000
measures

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
that ensure that the risk is no longer

286
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,200
likely to

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
materialize the

288
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,680
content of notification shall describe

289
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,560
the nature of the personal data bridge

290
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
including the categories and approximate

291
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,600
number of data subjects concerns

292
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
2. the name and contact details of the

293
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,880
data protection officer

294
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,360
or other contact points her more

295
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,079
information

296
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,360
can be obtained the content of

297
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
notification shall also describe the

298
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,199
likely consequences

299
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
of the personal data breach and the

300
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:44,720
measures

301
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
taken or proposed to be taken by the

302
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
controller

303
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
to address the personal data breach

304
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,240
including measures

305
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,519
to mitigate its possible adverse

306
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,040
effects about the exceptional situations

307
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,079
if the personal data breach is unlikely

308
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
to result in a risk

309
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
to the natural person's rights and

310
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,079
freedoms

311
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,720
there's no obligation to notify

312
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,480
the authority or the data subjects

313
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,360
by talent in the case of a personal data

314
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,160
breach

315
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
the data controller must notify the pdpc

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
of the bridge without anti-delay and

317
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,800
in any event within 72 hours of becoming

318
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,320
aware of it

319
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
except where the personal data breach is

320
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
unlikely to result in

321
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
a risk to individuals rights and

322
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
freedoms

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
under the thailand pdpa if a personal

324
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,160
data breach is

325
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,959
likely to result in a high risk to data

326
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,959
subjects rights and freedoms

327
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,839
the data controller must notify the

328
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,639
bridge to data subjects

329
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,920
currently the thailand pdpa does not

330
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,480
provide

331
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
requirements for the notification of

332
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
personal data breaches

333
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,680
however such a requirement will be

334
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
prescribed in the future

335
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,399
in a supplemental regulation of the pdpa

336
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,680
also the thailand pdpa does not provide

337
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,720
any exceptional situation however

338
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
pdpc may make a supplemental regulation

339
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,959
ruling the exceptions in the future the

340
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,279
pdpa also states that

341
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,240
data processors must notify data

342
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
controllers of the personal data

343
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,279
breaches

344
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,880
that have occurred but does not specify

345
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
a time frame

346
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,680
hi i'm vic now we are going to introduce

347
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,639
four data bridges incidents in four

348
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
countries

349
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,360
the first case is happened in taiwan

350
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
the data controller is militaries of

351
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,360
civil service

352
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
which is the department of taiwan

353
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
governments

354
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,759
handling promotions and retirements

355
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,399
the incident the closure day is at

356
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,880
2019 june

357
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
fireflies notified taiwan government

358
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,000
that there is a data bridge incident

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
someone is selling the taiwan

360
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,560
government's

361
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,199
employees data in darknet

362
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,240
the bridge data contain name personal id

363
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
add address and promotion records

364
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,360
from 240 thousand employees

365
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
in normal and sensitive departments

366
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,000
during 2005 to

367
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
2012.

368
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,600
the response and the announcements

369
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,240
from taiwan government said that the

370
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,199
data is

371
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,319
from the abandoned system which had

372
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,640
been compromised by attackers

373
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
the government will improve the

374
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
protection of

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,359
personal data protection

376
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,480
regards to the law

377
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,439
and according to the response and taiwan

378
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,440
pdpa

379
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,559
the institution which collects

380
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,760
personal data have to notify

381
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,799
data's subject after the relevant

382
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:46,559
facts of data bridge has been clarified

383
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,080
but sadly because two

384
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
members in my families are on the list

385
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,799
but they didn't receive any kind of

386
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,840
notification

387
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,280
so i think it's not a good way

388
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,480
to do the incident response

389
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,840
like this and it's not fit to

390
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,360
the taiwan pdpa the next one

391
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,440
is happened in japan data controller is

392
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
mitsubishi

393
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,360
the incidence happened in 2019

394
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,720
june attacker used

395
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,080
cv 2019-18187

396
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,360
which was the zero-day land

397
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,200
a directory traversal and arbitrary

398
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,480
fire upload or abilities in

399
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,320
trend micro office skin antivirus

400
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,360
to attack mitsubishi

401
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
office

402
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
attackers are believed from china

403
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,360
tick tick

404
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,000
which is a apt group

405
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,240
they stole about 2 000 resumes

406
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,280
employees data internal data

407
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
mitsubishi disclosed the scope and

408
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,840
announced that they'll start to notice

409
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,480
victims and recording to

410
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
japan pdpa is not

411
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
legally required to report

412
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,520
a data bridge incident to pvc

413
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,240
or notify the data subjects

414
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,600
but there is a guideline as

415
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,520
joy mentioned they recommend

416
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,280
to notify their subjects

417
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,760
due to the market standard practice

418
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,600
so mitsubishi did a really good job

419
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
about disclose the old details

420
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
and set of windows for

421
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
the data subject

422
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,120
the next one is an example in thailand

423
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,919
tarot time was attacked by vietnam

424
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,600
apt-32

425
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,880
as known as ocean lotus or

426
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
cobalt kt the scope of

427
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,080
bridge data is global

428
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,120
3.1 millions customers data

429
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,559
which contain name birth state and job

430
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,559
information toyota

431
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,679
thailand official website has

432
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,679
announced that there were texts

433
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
but there is no other information for

434
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,720
instance response that i can find

435
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,159
although thailand pdpa

436
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
is not in fact yet

437
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
according to the law after having become

438
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
aware of the data bridge

439
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
data containers should notify their

440
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,240
subjects

441
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,679
who with high risk to damage rights and

442
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,880
freedoms

443
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,880
no later than 72 hours

444
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
so if the thailand pdpa

445
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,360
was in fact they should notify data

446
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,080
subjects

447
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,559
for this

448
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,919
in 2018 british airways suffered

449
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
a significant bridge of their systems

450
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,280
with personal

451
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,720
and financial details of 0.43 millions

452
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,320
customers being packed making is

453
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
the one of the most severe

454
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,559
cyber attacks in uk history

455
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
one of the official website

456
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,240
was redirect to malicious website by

457
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,799
attackers

458
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,840
the bridge data contained name booking

459
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
record

460
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,799
credit card numbers and address

461
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
the incident response and the

462
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
announcement said that

463
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,120
they will notify victims

464
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,000
as soon as possible through email

465
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
and according to gdpr

466
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,760
they have to notify data subject

467
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,080
in 17 hours but they didn't

468
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,679
so the fine can be up to four

469
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,760
percent of yearly revenue

470
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,960
so about 230 million

471
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
usd which is the highest

472
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,600
fine the ico have ever

473
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,320
leveled at a company for data

474
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
they find

475
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,720
25 million usd as the final result

476
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,240
considering the copyrighting situation

477
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,840
and the reducing of the revenue

478
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,360
after we go through these four cases and

479
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
there is a response

480
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,840
we are going to look closely to incident

481
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,720
response and

482
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,080
regulation international

483
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,600
trend of handling data bridge is divided

484
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,039
to two types

485
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,159
risk driven and regulation driven

486
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,080
first risk driven type

487
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,520
for example gdpr and thailand pdpa

488
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,039
the notification obligation is based on

489
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,080
the risk assessment

490
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,240
the second one regulation driven type

491
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,919
for example taiwan pdpa belongs to this

492
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,840
type

493
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,480
it's ruled that companies need to notify

494
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,120
data subjects while there's a

495
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,559
data bridge but there's

496
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,679
no exception or consideration about the

497
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
risk

498
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
therefore if it's possible to check

499
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,720
all legal requirements in different

500
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,880
jurisdiction the company

501
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
could check first the type

502
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,080
of the regulation as we mentioned

503
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,279
then you will know if you need to add

504
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,360
the wrist assessment

505
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,479
into the process

506
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,240
least and sense is the response flow are

507
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,440
very common

508
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
and acceptable for companies

509
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
the companies import this system and

510
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
customize it

511
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,279
as an internal incident response flow

512
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
so according to the pdpas

513
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
we have mission and gdpr

514
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,039
for risk driven type um like thailand

515
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,159
pdpa

516
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,240
and gdpr the company may need to notify

517
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
data subjects who with

518
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,279
high risk to damage rise and freedoms

519
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:58,080
no later than 72 hours but

520
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,159
as we follow the nissan says

521
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,880
it's a response flow when is the origin

522
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,679
72 hours start to tick

523
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,520
the answer is peak one

524
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,440
the answer should be preparations

525
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
but

526
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
the um gdpr

527
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,720
requires that you have to provide

528
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,400
some elements in the notification

529
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,120
to data subjects

530
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,880
so when can the company actually collect

531
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,760
the necessary information for net

532
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,240
notifications

533
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,279
actually it should be green

534
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,559
because we have four elements

535
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,080
in the notification that we have to

536
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
collect before we send it to data

537
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,000
subject

538
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,080
the first the categories

539
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,039
and appreciates numbers of data subjects

540
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,720
concerned the second one

541
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,640
is the contact point the third one is

542
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
the likely

543
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,440
consequence of the bridge and the last

544
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
one is the measure taken or proposed

545
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,679
to be taken

546
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,120
so we combine

547
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,760
the regulations and the incident

548
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,320
response

549
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,799
flow let's we have to

550
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,240
start analyzing as

551
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
the preparations and

552
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,760
finally send the notifications to data

553
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
subject

554
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:03,440
when we finish the analyzing

555
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,720
almost all the data protection laws

556
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,679
require data controllers and data

557
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,799
processors

558
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,520
must provide appropriate security

559
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
measures

560
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,559
in order to prevent those assessed use

561
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,679
change revisions or

562
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,279
disclosures of personal data without

563
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,240
authorizations

564
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
an incident response plan would be an

565
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
important part of

566
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,679
appropriate measures to manage

567
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,559
data protection and legal compliance

568
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,840
but as japan pdpa mentioned

569
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,600
they recommend to follow the market

570
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
standard practice

571
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,840
which i believe should mean

572
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,639
the honesty and transparency

573
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,679
win the trust of your customers

574
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,880
or you can say

575
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,960
the trust of your data subjects

576
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,559
is always important

577
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,799
data privacy has become a key issue over

578
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,360
the past

579
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,320
several years
