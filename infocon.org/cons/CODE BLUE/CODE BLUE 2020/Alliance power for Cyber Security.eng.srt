[Music]

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,279
our next session is

3
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,160
alliance power of cyber security please

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,439
welcome our speaker

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
mr kenneth gears

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
thank you so much for your attendance i

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,800
study the

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
connection between cyber security and

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
national security

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
and i've been doing that since 93 so

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
before long it will be 30 years

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
so a couple of words on world war ii

13
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
winston churchill after the war said

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,640
that

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
signals intelligence and decryption

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,760
of enemy communications

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,119
was decisive in the war and many

18
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,119
analysts say that it

19
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
shortened the war by up to two years

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
and it's hard to

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
to um see that this is not

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
a critical piece of national security

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,880
when you consider the weight of such

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
argument

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
now fast forward to the

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,280
time of the internet in the world wide

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
web

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,159
already nato's first

29
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,720
major operation over kosovo in serbia

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
we saw hacker attacks

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,960
against not only infrastructure at nato

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
but in washington dc and

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
tactically among the units that were

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,840
fighting

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,120
so what it showed was

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
as soon as the world wide web existed

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,760
there were

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,120
opportunities uh to target

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
weapon systems

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
as well as

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,280
anywhere in the world

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
i was posted to estonia during its

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,319
crisis

44
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
with russia in 2007

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
and here you can see the use

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
of a cyber attack to

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,080
force another country to make a

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
political decision

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
it was fairly simple but again

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
it was called web war one

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
for a reason it was an experiment

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
it was an effort to use a denial of

53
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,840
service attack

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
for political purposes

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,280
one year later there was a real war

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,720
in the country of georgia and here

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,000
for the first time we saw the combined

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,959
use of computer network operations

59
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
together with military operations

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
and this occurred weeks before the

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
conflict

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,920
until after the conflict and so

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
today you do not send

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,239
soldiers into war

65
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
without hacker support this is clear

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
and this is easy to see in military

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,560
doctrine

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,640
of many nations that is published

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
two years later in iran we saw

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,560
that computer code

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
could actually be a substitute for

72
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,680
missiles and for a traditional

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
military attack a half

74
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
megabyte of code in this case

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
turned off a thousand

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,639
nuclear centrifuges normally

77
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,000
those would be bombed from the air

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
by a plane but in this case

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
it happened quietly and it took

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
a long time for the victim to figure out

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,960
even what happened and this is the sort

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,360
of

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
era that we're living in now in which

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,479
computer network operations or cyber

85
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
attacks

86
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,080
give you an alternative means

87
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,840
of power an alternative means to use

88
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
force against arrival

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
and that happens sometimes when you

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
don't have

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
any other option

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
i was also in ukraine in 2014

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
teaching cyber security at university

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,680
and there i got to see

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,800
many different kinds of cyber attack

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
including against the presidential

97
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,600
election

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
which the united states should have

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
see have seen as a warning

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
because the the cert the computer

101
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
emergency response team

102
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
that investigated the

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
attack and the intrusion said that it

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,360
was the most sophisticated

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,319
code that they had ever seen and

106
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
investigated

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
and it was all to accomplish a political

108
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,400
goal

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,319
which was to delegitimize democracy

110
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
in ukraine

111
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
beyond that we saw military attacks

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,759
economic attacks diplomatic attacks

113
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,600
u.s diplomats had their communications

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
captured

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,080
via traditional intelligence uploaded to

116
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
youtube

117
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,400
and announced on twitter

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,720
so ukraine is definitely the hot spot

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
for cyber warfare today and the reason

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,120
is simple

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,720
it has a real war ongoing

122
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
and real wars do not happen without

123
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,479
cyber war accompanying them

124
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,479
in 2016 in washington

125
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,599
maybe the biggest hack in history

126
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,680
right if you consider that it might have

127
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,800
turned an election in washington

128
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,599
from one candidate to another

129
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
literally changing the course of history

130
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,240
right the ability

131
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
merely to steal information and to

132
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,840
leak it at

133
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,120
opportune times

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,319
this is powerful uh and it goes

135
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
to the very heart of information

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,560
operations which are now run

137
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
in cyberspace how do you affect

138
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,599
the decision-making of a leader

139
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,160
or the decision-making of a target

140
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
population

141
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,840
and all of these i believe happen every

142
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,000
day

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
they may not be so successful

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
but adversaries are running them because

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,720
they are cheap and because they move

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,599
quickly and they can penetrate

147
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,560
specifically into social media

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
and in these social media bubbles

149
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
where you have trusted companions

150
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,360
and friends uh provide you information

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
that is difficult to deny

152
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,759
you have already allowed these people

153
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
into your friend groups and so you will

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,039
see their information

155
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,559
uh and it's a hard problem to solve

156
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
we are experiencing that in the united

157
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,599
states

158
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,080
again in 2020.

159
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
in the country of belarus

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
between poland and russia there is

161
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,399
currently quite a revolution

162
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,600
taking place and you can see here

163
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,440
the number of people who voted

164
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
for a new candidate and

165
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
who basically have been put down by the

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
current government

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
showing the power of violence

168
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,600
in the power of repression against

169
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,200
the majority of people can still happen

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,399
even in 2020 this story

171
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
is far from over but there are a lot of

172
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
cyber elements to it

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
one of the things that the security

174
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,279
forces are doing

175
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,480
is trying to cover their faces so

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
that they cannot be identified

177
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
by people and their identities posted to

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
the world wide web

179
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,760
however uh even just their eyes

180
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,560
are being captured now with software and

181
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
citizens can tell only with the

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
eyes who the security personnel are

183
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,640
and they're publishing their personal

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,120
details online

185
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
so watch this story because it's only

186
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
getting more intense

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,040
the violence has recently grown very

188
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,599
serious

189
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
now at nato headquarters we have

190
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
something

191
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,959
that i think is

192
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,240
a different case altogether from belarus

193
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
here you have a

194
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
political and economic power

195
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,920
that leads to a military and a cyber

196
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
power

197
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,160
but ultimately it's the alliance concept

198
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,480
that is so important if you're running

199
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
hostile cyber attacks against democracy

200
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
or against a country in europe or in

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,399
north america

202
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,079
in this case now remember that

203
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,959
most of the countries in the eu and nato

204
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,160
are the same

205
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,079
in fact when nato or the eu

206
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,319
jointly investigate

207
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,320
run best practices in

208
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,279
cyber security

209
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,320
run intelligence and law enforcement

210
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
operations

211
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,519
together as a group

212
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,839
this is between 30 and 40

213
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,079
countries acting together

214
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,440
it is literally the world's only

215
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
possible cyber superpower

216
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,160
one country alone i know from personal

217
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,200
experience

218
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,399
working 20 years at the pentagon

219
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,320
even the united states is quite lost

220
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,560
when it comes to attribution

221
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,600
and investigation

222
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,880
of cyber attacks because there is only

223
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
one internet

224
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,120
and only one cyberspace and the united

225
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,160
states must have allies

226
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
so in this case nato and the eu

227
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,880
are working together ever more closely

228
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
every day

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,279
and you just think of the power of

230
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,440
let's say 35 intelligence

231
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,760
law enforcement network security

232
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,120
staff working together there's multiple

233
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,760
agencies

234
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,480
doing that in each country so already

235
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,240
you're talking about

236
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
hundreds of first-class agencies working

237
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,399
together

238
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,760
and this is the super cyber superpower

239
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
so let's look at a couple of things that

240
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
the alliance is doing

241
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,880
they have declared cyberspace as a

242
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
domain of military

243
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
operations the same as air

244
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,839
land and sea cyber security is a

245
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,120
core task of collective defense

246
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
within the alliance international law

247
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
applies every bit as much

248
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
in cyberspace as it does in historic

249
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,720
traditional space what we're seeking

250
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
is stability we are seeking

251
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,480
international

252
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
stability and peace within

253
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,680
this new domain uh and

254
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
the only way we're going to get there is

255
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
strength through diversity

256
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,519
a defensive philosophy and

257
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,399
partnering with the eu and so again this

258
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,519
is between 30 and 40 countries

259
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
working together i worked

260
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
uh between 2007 and 11 at the nato cyber

261
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,600
center

262
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
in estonia and here you can see recently

263
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,279
angela merkel who visited the center

264
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,320
cyber security has that much

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
magnetic power i got to be the first

266
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,800
researcher

267
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,839
ever to be posted to the center

268
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
in 2007 and today

269
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,600
it's 25 nations on staff

270
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
full-time and i've seen

271
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,320
many delegations come from japan

272
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
and other countries in asia all the way

273
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
to see what's happening

274
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
at the tactical level more at the

275
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,600
military and intelligence

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,680
officer level there's a lot happening

277
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
some of the things that i'll mention

278
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,120
include

279
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
the integration of national cyber

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
contributions

281
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,720
computer network operations are often

282
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
classified

283
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,160
or compartmentalized in ways

284
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,440
that keep them in a secret

285
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,079
folder nato is figuring out how to tap

286
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,160
into them so that they can be used

287
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,399
for nato operations

288
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,519
toward that end nato is building a cyber

289
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,920
operations center that will

290
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,839
manage this effort for the entire

291
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,720
alliance

292
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
and currently there is a partnership

293
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
with industry

294
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,800
and also malware sharing program

295
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
right when nations discover malware they

296
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,399
can

297
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,600
share it i was in ukraine

298
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
just last year when they joined

299
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,040
the malware information sharing program

300
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
they were very excited about it and just

301
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
think of the potential

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,040
when large countries

303
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,480
with very capable intelligence and law

304
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
enforcement

305
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
begin to share

306
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,399
about cyber attacks campaigns

307
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,720
actors results of investigations

308
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,519
this is how we will move forward

309
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,880
internationally on cyber security

310
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,920
here is a book that i just published

311
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,279
through atlantic council

312
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,639
and here's a link it's a free download

313
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
and i talk a little bit about the

314
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
history of cyber war

315
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,839
about the importance of collective

316
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,000
defense

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
as well as a major study that i did for

318
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,440
nato

319
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,560
on the cyber dimension of the russia

320
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
ukraine crisis

321
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
and then i finish with recommendations

322
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,359
and one of those recommendations i can

323
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
tell you

324
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,039
is a voluntary

325
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,640
desire or voluntary move to

326
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
not undertake cyber espionage within the

327
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,359
alliance

328
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,280
right nations today i think are addicted

329
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,240
to running

330
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,039
computer network operations specifically

331
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,480
just to collect

332
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
information but if we can stop

333
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,799
that within the alliance we can get

334
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,640
a lot farther in not only promoting

335
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,080
trust within the alliance

336
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
but also isolating bad actors

337
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,480
right when we do find

338
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,600
cyber espionage code it will be quicker

339
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,000
and

340
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
easier to figure out who the

341
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,039
ultimate source and actor

342
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,880
was that undertook the operation

343
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
so that's my talk thank you very

344
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
much please send questions to slidoo

345
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,720
or join me in whereby after

346
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
for a discussion and i'll let you go on

347
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
since it is time
