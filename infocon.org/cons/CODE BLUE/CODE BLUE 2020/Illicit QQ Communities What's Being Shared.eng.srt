00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,600
next session is illicit qq communities

going to jump

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
into discussing with the audience a

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
unique set of data

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
groups of chinese speaking actors on

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
chat qq

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
who are engaged in better around fraud

17
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,240
and hacking tools

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
tactics and techniques the activities

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
i'll highlight

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
are a few key members engaging in

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
activity that can be thought of as

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,320
illicit

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,720
legal ranking of terms of services

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,840
agreements or

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,280
rent behavior in many of these groups

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
mainly technology and hacking theme

27
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,320
groups are

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
sharing files lots of files and some of

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,840
the malicious software

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
some of which i will show our audience

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
today

32
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
first note about me as i said i'm aaron

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
i have been researching mostly in

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,040
chinese language threats

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,759
emanating from china externally as well

36
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
as threats to businesses

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,560
in china both from within china

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
and threats to china from abroad

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,479
my journey into anything back in high

40
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,640
school when they offered a pilot program

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,479
in chinese language study it was the

42
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,560
only option besides latin german spanish

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,598
and french

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
i took my first course and i've

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
regretted it ever since

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,160
because chinese is my opinion and i

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
think the opinion of many others

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
exceedingly difficult

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,599
but since then i've lived in china with

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,599
one half years including skins at

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
university and at chiang mai university

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
in beijing

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
i then pursued my master's degree at

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
washington university in washington dc

55
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
and after four years working within the

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
public sector i began working for

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
various private interventions focused on

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,760
different types of security and risk

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,879
including

60
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,480
regulatory compliance finance sanctions

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
technology diversion reputational risk

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,959
brand protection due diligence and now

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
cyber threats at flashback

64
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,000
so some of our partners in japan uh the

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
king of record are here today

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
and i really hope to be able to come to

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
japan in person again one day soon

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
i was there last year and it was an

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,720
amazing experience

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
so today i'm going to explain what qq is

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
for the group

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
i'll go over frequently found fraud

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,959
types it won't be a comprehensive

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
overview of all fraud types and you may

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,360
have seen

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,879
some scams not included there is more

77
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
content in qq

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
uh with over 800 million active monthly

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
users uh that can be covered in three

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,040
hours let alone 30 minutes

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
but i've spent a significant amount of

82
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
time in this platform learning the

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
language of

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
cyber underground actors we'll touch on

85
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
some of that

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
and i'll also touch on detection

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,760
avoidance versus turning a blind eye

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,159
i posit to you that the fraud types that

89
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,360
are top of mind for security

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
practitioners in china

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,599
and outside of china are not necessarily

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,920
aligned in many cases

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,840
because of who or what types of fraud

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,159
this fraud is harming so china's recent

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,760
adoption of a personal information

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,879
security law

97
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
i think is a move in the right direction

98
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,560
perhaps for providing

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
more legal framework for pursuing flavor

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,000
and violations of

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
personally identifiable information in

102
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
china but a lot of what i'm seeing

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
in qq when i'm seeing bots sold and

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
defrauded touches on populations or

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,640
entities

106
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
outside of china moreover members use

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,040
slang memes and emoticons to avoid

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,199
detection

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
i'll end the presentation by discussing

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,320
uh the future of threat detection

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
so what is qqq was initially released in

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,080
1999

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,560
making it about 21 years old since then

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
it's gone through successive upgrades

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
and includes

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
the ability to create groups after

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
gradual privilege escalation which is

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,840
basically determined by

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
time in the app and amount of activity

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
groups are anywhere between

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,560
tens of users to up to over one thousand

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
again there's over 800 million monthly

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
users on qq

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
so my own research comprises a very

125
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
small amount of that data but i don't

126
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
want to downplay

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
what i think is an impactful group of

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
threat actors for reasons that i hope

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,160
are

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
apparent to you by the end of this

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
presentation um oh and the

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
little uh qq icon is that cute little

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
penguin on the bottom left

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
so compared to other apps um according

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,600
to this data port report

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
uh qql still still ranks in the top

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
seven social media platforms and if you

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
filter for messenger or chat apps

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,160
cocoon wechat account for two of the top

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,120
five apps

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
so this is a big chunk of of global

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
users and when we talk about impact we

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
need to talk about scale

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,039
which i think is one thing that qq has

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,400
there are a lot of users

146
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
so what's an illicit community loosely

147
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
defined it is community that supports

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,199
fraud

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,360
cyber crime or financial gain money

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,199
laundering and other illegal activities

151
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,199
groups also discuss fraud hacking tools

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
and techniques

153
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
so as this flashpoint report shows

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
typical internet users see about five

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
percent of the regular internet

156
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
and there's a whole other section

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,759
accessible through special browsers

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,840
configurations logins etc as many of our

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,039
audience members

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,080
know one of the hallmarks of illicit

161
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,039
communities

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,160
is that their creative use of language

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,319
and that's absolutely the case uh in the

164
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,680
chinese language communities pictured

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
are some common examples of hacker slang

166
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
as you can see each slack slang term is

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
a unique combination of chinese

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,479
characters or

169
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,319
chinese characters in english words

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,840
sometimes the slang uses numbers or

171
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,199
emoticons

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
the slang is mature and almost takes on

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
a dialect of its own

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
so i think time and information and

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
language facility is key to threat

176
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,120
detection in this space

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
so you can see the first one pants cooza

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
in chinese sounds like

179
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
the word for data in chinese mm being

180
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
the first

181
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
letter of the first english word for the

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,039
chinese word for trojan which is

183
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
muuma and then the third one down yuan

184
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,960
kong is

185
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,680
basically a remote access tool and then

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,639
you have done

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
for ddos don being the word for single

188
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
as in single point of congestion in a

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,680
tdos attack

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
so let's talk about threats and i think

191
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
it would be useful first to talk about

192
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,039
threats from the perspective of

193
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,720
detection within china

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
so fraud is reported and notes are

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
published by companies like tencent

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
which is the parent company qq most

197
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
recent reporting shows the top three

198
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
fraud types are

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,599
business fraud uh income or employment

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,240
schemes

201
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
and friend which are likely romance type

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
schemes

203
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
one issue with the reporting is that

204
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
they don't define in great

205
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
detail what these major fraud types are

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
but we can extrapolate based on online

207
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
searches and perhaps our own findings

208
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
discuss today what each front type is a

209
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
mass study

210
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
that can adequately quantify fraud is

211
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
not possible now

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
but it should come as no surprise that

213
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,160
most fraud types are

214
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,440
financially motivated in nature

215
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
what i assess uh within the q groups

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
are a large type of the following types

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
of fraud and different ttps around these

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
different types of fraud so

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,479
credit card fraud retail and online

220
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,879
fraud phishing ddos

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,960
some ransomware discussions in chatter

222
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,280
and a lot of file sharing

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,319
of different types of tools and

224
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
malicious files

225
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
so first talking about credit card fraud

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
within qq

227
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
this type of fraud is highly

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
internationalized as you can see in the

229
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
example in the center which is a snippet

230
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,599
from a chat

231
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,160
group um you have different types of

232
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
cvvs

233
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
targeting countries like japan the

234
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
united states europe

235
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,800
it's highly commercial commercialized a

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,639
lot of uh

237
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,240
threat actors on qq do support

238
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
cryptocurrency payments

239
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
um and and many of them also pivot

240
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
to other chat tools so you have tools

241
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
such as telegram which is a borderless

242
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,958
chat tool that is not under uh the uh

243
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,320
influence of

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
the the chinese uh censorship or

245
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,959
monitoring authorities for example

246
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,560
and so you have we have evidence in this

247
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
case uh i had to redact the usernames

248
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,560
but this particular

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,959
qq user rather prolific credit card

250
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,080
seller is also active

251
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,959
in at least four other um well-known

252
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
telegram channels

253
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
so you can see the internationalized

254
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
nature of this particular fraud type

255
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
same example here um threat actors

256
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,040
on qq discussing dumps discussing even

257
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,360
uh

258
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
emv technology or emv uh technology

259
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,279
fraud

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
um and also pivoting to uh telegram

261
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
groups to

262
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,399
both promote the sales of whatever

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
credit cards they're trying to sell and

264
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
also to engage in

265
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
chatter around different types of known

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
and emerging fraud types

267
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,360
in the credit card fraud space so

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
next up is um online fraud

269
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,720
uh so uh in this space

270
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,279
threat actors engage in various types of

271
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,959
retail or online fraud

272
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
um essentially you have

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
uh e-commerce platforms all kinds of

274
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
e-commerce platforms

275
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
uh being brought up for sale even ones

276
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
that have entered the chinese market

277
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,680
within the last

278
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,399
few months um very quickly become swept

279
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,519
up in this type of

280
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,360
proxy account opening and payment

281
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
services a lot of this activity we could

282
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
qualify as rent seeking behavior

283
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
certainly not in terms of service

284
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
compliant behavior

285
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,920
in some cases we have examples of

286
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
merchants furnishing um identify

287
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,079
identification documents

288
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,640
along with uh accounts uh which is

289
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,920
really teetering on

290
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
a type of um synthetic identity fraud or

291
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,440
providing

292
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
uh false or doctor document fraud with

293
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:30,560
those

294
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
account sales um and

295
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,800
the prices of these go anywhere from 600

296
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
to 1600 rmb

297
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
um depending on whether or not they're

298
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
secondhand or firsthand or what country

299
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
they're being offered in

300
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
um there's a significant effort on qq to

301
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
sell social media accounts and i'm gonna

302
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
pick on facebook for this one i think

303
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,040
they can take it

304
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
um although as you can see from the ad

305
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
on the right uh companies like

306
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,040
instagram twitter youtube and gmail are

307
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
also included

308
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
um the market for social media accounts

309
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,760
sales is high

310
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,560
um so i think in some sense this is

311
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
about enabling

312
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
access to these social media accounts

313
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
that folks normally can't have

314
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
um it's about selling accounts at scale

315
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
and perhaps there's some larger

316
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
conspiracy at play

317
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
um a lot of chatter suggests that

318
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
they'll use the accounts for advertising

319
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,839
while others may use them for more

320
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,920
nefarious purposes such as creating

321
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,519
the illusion of the endorsement of a

322
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
product or even a cause

323
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
and so i think especially during

324
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
election seasons globally

325
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
when we think about the ability to spin

326
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,440
up social media accounts at scale

327
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
um you know groups are likely seeking

328
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
out these types of services in order to

329
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
to carry out those campaigns and then to

330
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,640
go one step further

331
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
um here's a price list that we obtained

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
as you can see

333
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,760
on the top right one account is bought

334
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
for very little money um

335
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
a pittance at you know two dollars and

336
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
forty cents and so a scalable campaign

337
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,000
that

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,279
could leverage these social media

339
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,079
accounts is accessible even to resource

340
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,920
restricted groups um when it comes to

341
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
to database sales qq members advertise

342
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,279
lots of databases

343
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,399
essentially the idea it may come as no

344
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
surprise is to monetize

345
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,519
whatever data is previously collected in

346
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,360
some cases threat actors advertise

347
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,720
a hodgepodge of data and it makes me

348
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
wonder about their credibility as they

349
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,200
look like

350
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,680
basically a database junkyard or thrift

351
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
store

352
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,200
the seller on the right for example uh

353
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
in this advertisement is selling several

354
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
different kinds of seemingly

355
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,040
unrelated databases um the same third

356
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
actor is selling phished emails

357
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,360
uh as the language and the redbox shows

358
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
the threat actor

359
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
in this situation uh qq thread actor

360
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
provided a sample of ten thousand emails

361
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,839
that appear

362
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,800
to be emails with passwords uh seen

363
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,079
redacted at left

364
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
and regardless of its origin or whether

365
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
or not it's previously disclosed

366
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
the fact that this is spreading in qq i

367
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,240
think is significant

368
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
um but it goes beyond fish data right a

369
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,000
number of phished

370
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
phishing source code files are shared

371
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
including the ones listed at right

372
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,880
and that's a essentially a snapshot of

373
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
phishing source code files that are

374
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
shared within the

375
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
file sharing feature of qqq groups um

376
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
and then the names of some common

377
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
phishing source codes

378
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
uh that are shared are in the um the

379
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,600
diagram at right

380
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
uh ddos is becoming an increasingly

381
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
popular way for threat actors to

382
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
threaten organizations ddos and ddos's

383
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,839
ddos as a service are prolific

384
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
within qq groups and as you can see on

385
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,639
the right the use of memes

386
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
is just one example of a way that threat

387
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,160
actors both avoid detection

388
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
and also implicate kind of an ambiguous

389
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
use of their skill set

390
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
so this person it's not clear if

391
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,720
they're doing ddos for good for ill or

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
perhaps both

393
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
a lot of that information comes out when

394
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
you track the actor

395
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
or engage them in some way to find out

396
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
how their services can be leveraged

397
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,079
but based on limited chatter that we've

398
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,360
seen most of the

399
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
ddos uh discussions in qq the open

400
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,720
discussions

401
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,760
uh people express their desire to ddos

402
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,800
gambling sites

403
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
um some payment services sites and also

404
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
pornography sites

405
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
so another example of how qq is um

406
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
one component of a larger network of

407
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,639
thread actors um

408
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,639
and i want this point to to become clear

409
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,839
and i hope it has

410
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
is um this thread actually qq advertises

411
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,160
ddos as a service and then they have a

412
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
presence on telegram

413
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,959
and then they go one step further and

414
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
have a handle

415
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
and a public-facing site on twitter so

416
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,519
it all comes full circle and

417
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,000
obviously the two services on the right

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,680
telegram and twitter are blocked in

419
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,880
in china whereas qq obviously is still

420
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
used for prolific

421
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,680
obviously transfer is top of mind for

422
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
many security professionals nowadays and

423
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,320
for good reason

424
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
um as far as ransomware chatter is

425
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
concerned there are ransomware themed

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,480
groups

427
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
uh a lot of them at least on the face uh

428
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,680
advertise

429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,480
uh ransomware recovery uh techniques or

430
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,760
services or just

431
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
information sharing around ransomware

432
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
again because it is

433
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,639
so popular but if you look within the

434
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,600
file sharing

435
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,639
folders of these groups you do find

436
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,680
there are examples of file types being

437
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,000
shared

438
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
that may or may not be malicious may or

439
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,600
may not be ransomware

440
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,720
um they're there uh this is just one

441
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
example but i think you know obviously

442
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,959
you can

443
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600
uh see something perhaps from not petya

444
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
on the bottom left there

445
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
on the middle top uh something implying

446
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,320
a relationship to the wannacry

447
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
ransomware campaigns

448
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,199
um and then you have some um

449
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
uh file names that suggest that this

450
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,639
ransomware may be

451
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
uh maybe something that is

452
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,560
specific to this group or the name in

453
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,880
any case is not clear what exactly it is

454
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,639
and so this presents obviously a

455
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
challenge for security researchers

456
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,399
uh to try and uncover and investigate

457
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
exactly

458
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,199
you know how what these files are and

459
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
how they how they perform or if they

460
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,440
even

461
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
work

462
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,360
um as far as tools and files shared

463
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
among groups i can say that it's

464
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,440
prolific

465
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
we have numerous samples from groups

466
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
that are copies of widely known tools

467
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
china chopper for example on top right

468
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
well-known tool has been used as a

469
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,160
as an attack vector by apt groups for

470
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,720
example

471
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
i'm not saying that they're getting

472
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,360
their uh their tools from this specific

473
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
group but these tools are being shared

474
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
in the wild not surprising but i think

475
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,839
still significant

476
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
you also have legacy tools such as gray

477
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,199
pigeon

478
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,560
rat second one from the top

479
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,079
and then again while sharing tools in

480
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
the wild is not surprising i think

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
our aperture or our view into this

482
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,759
community of threat actors has

483
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,120
traditionally been limited

484
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,839
and unfortunately the barriers to entry

485
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,639
within

486
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,480
chinese language social media spaces

487
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,639
like qq and wechat

488
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
the barrier to entries are growing

489
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
increasingly more difficult and so i

490
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
think that moving forward as security

491
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,319
reachers

492
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,799
researchers we are faced uh as all

493
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
people who are trying to study and

494
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
understand china which is growing

495
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
increasingly opaque especially in the

496
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
information environment we're faced with

497
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,079
a greater challenges uh then add to that

498
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,480
that

499
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,439
just the amount of data uh the quantity

500
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,640
of data available for

501
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,400
analysis is so much greater um so

502
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
lastly i wanted to give you a very crude

503
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,360
and simple slide about ttps

504
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
as far as accessing all these sites

505
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,799
outside of china are concerned

506
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
even though chinese authorities do carry

507
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,160
out campaigns to crack down on a list of

508
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
vpns

509
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,200
they're a market for vpn sales in china

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,679
still

511
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,559
very strong and i think this screen grab

512
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,280
to me just

513
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
sort of very simply showed you that if

514
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
you have if you're writing on chinese

515
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,039
tele

516
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,679
telecom like jungle yantong and you have

517
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,640
a cell phone

518
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
and you have a vpn and you have a

519
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,640
translation tool as this user has all

520
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,880
four uh you can pretty adeptly navigate

521
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,679
uh the the card spaces outside of china

522
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,440
for example this card mafia site which i

523
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,000
believe is

524
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,799
perhaps based in in russia so you don't

525
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,440
need a lot

526
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
to get to the other side um

527
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
so i'm just gonna kind of bring it home

528
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,000
here but essentially

529
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
um the frog types being cracked down in

530
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,720
china

531
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,760
i think are uh

532
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
areas that matter most to everyday

533
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
chinese online users

534
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,840
um authorities have tended to focus on

535
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
controlling for sensitive content

536
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,440
and the focus i think has been largely

537
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
on societal unrest so

538
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
perhaps the types of frauds that they're

539
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,440
pursuing are

540
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
a function of that of that uh of their

541
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
their

542
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
goal to to to rein in anything that

543
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,000
cause uh instability and and discomfort

544
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
for everyday people

545
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,600
but the fraud types and impact

546
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
communities outside of china

547
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,600
leverage data that isn't from china and

548
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
pivot back and forth from

549
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,400
china-restricted mediums such as qq to

550
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
borderless chat apps like telegram

551
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
and i think that this model of cyber

552
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
underground threat is certainly formal

553
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
formidable

554
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,880
uh in the sense that it creates a buffer

555
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,760
between

556
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
domestic chinese doctors and the wider

557
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
internationalized

558
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
threat communities how this is playing

559
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
out as difficult to know largely because

560
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,400
of

561
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
a lack of scaled analysis

562
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
uh using different threat types to

563
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
understand connections between

564
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
uh the activities that happen outside of

565
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,280
china and the chatter taking place

566
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,160
within china

567
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
in tools uh like qq

568
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
and other tools um so

569
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,679
i'm gonna go ahead and um conclude with

570
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,080
that

571
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
and i welcome any questions i'll slide

572
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
over to

573
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
slido after this and i hope to see some

574
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
of you there so thanks again very much i

575
