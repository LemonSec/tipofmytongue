it is a world wide web

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
but all politics is local planning to

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,079
survive a

principal with accenture cyberstride

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,680
intelligence

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,159
based in washington dc area in the

12
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
united states

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
thank you for taking the time to join me

i'm very honored to have the opportunity

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,439
to attend this year's cold blue

17
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,799
conference virtually my topic today

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,840
um let me share my screen with you

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
so my talking today is um

20
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,920
about planning to survive a vulcanizing

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,439
internet this um research is

22
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,960
inspired by a client engagement

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,079
this particular client was investing in

24
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,040
strengthening security controls and

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
processes

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,119
and overall strategy for one of their

27
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
regional operations during this

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
engagement

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,200
it is it occurs um to us

30
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,200
that the industry often proposes

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
a one-size-fits-all mentality to risk

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,239
management and the network architectures

33
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
needed to achieve it namely

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
and do it the cheapest and the most

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
efficient way

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,480
possible despite that fact that

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,519
cyber stress has been involving in the

38
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,360
global context

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,760
of an increasingly segmented internet

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
so in today's talk i will start from the

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,519
concept of

42
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
internet book innovation talk about the

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
driving factors

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
of internet organization and some trends

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,760
i have

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
observed then discuss the implication of

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
internet organization

48
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
for global businesses and lastly i will

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
offer some mitigation measures to help

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,239
organization organizations

51
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,080
survive or organize organizing internet

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,400
and

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
improve business reliancy

54
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,879
let's get to the topic so what

55
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,319
is internet recognization

56
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,440
as we know the internet is a massive

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
network of networks that connect

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
computers

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
globally and allow computer to

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,959
communicate and

61
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,720
exchange information the world

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,640
web web an information sharing model

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,519
that build on top of the internet was

64
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
intended to communicate

65
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
share and distributed information

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,319
with other borders but since it's worse

67
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
countries have varied in their

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,480
understanding and their policies

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,159
on how the internet should work in their

70
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
jurisdiction this leads to the concept

71
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
of internet organization

72
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,358
the idea that internet could not only

73
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,240
unite

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,199
but also fragment us has actually

75
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,400
existed

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,199
for decades and the different people

77
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,120
have brought uh different

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,120
aspects of this as early as

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
uh 1997 and two scholars

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
from mit wrote in the study electronic

81
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,440
community global electronic communities

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
global village or cyber balkans

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
the scholar explored explored

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
the possibility that improving

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
communications

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,280
access through emerging technology will

87
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,160
fragment society and obvious

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
interactions

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,840
what they were referring to was the

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,960
self-segregation

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
of users along lines of social

92
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
intellectual and economic affiliations

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,320
which could divide people in the same

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,360
way that

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
geographic divisions do now

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
the term uh splinternet

97
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
when it first presented in 2001

98
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
refers to the potential benefit of

99
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,840
parallel internet that would be run as

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,600
distinct private and autonomous networks

101
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
as to the internet sovereignty and

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,720
concept

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
it was first introduced in china's 2010

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
white paper

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,000
outlining china's civilization on the

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
internet

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,440
i said the digital colonialism

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
focused on big tech companies developing

109
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
and controlling

110
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,520
tech ecosystem for commercial gain

111
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,800
the last one globalization

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,120
means the idea of following of slowing

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,440
globalization and

114
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,560
potentially reversing it because of the

115
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,280
stress of

116
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
technological development so

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
all this various concept of internet

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,319
organization

119
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
intertwines with each other but the

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,479
common theme

121
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
that the internet could be segmented

122
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,080
about

123
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
divided organized and

124
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
centralized within the particular

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
countries

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,639
all of which seem to be at odds with

127
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
what the internet was supposed to be

128
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
so behind each concept of

129
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,319
internet organization there are reasons

130
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
how the concept

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
formulated this this reason that often

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
the driving factors which push the

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
internet forward

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,440
uh push the trend forward so as

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
i said prep previously the design of the

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,599
internet is open

137
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
free and boring borderless but some do

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
see the risk

139
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,759
in then in the open internet

140
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
for example scholars from council on

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,000
foreign relations

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
in the us have summed up major risks

143
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
of an open internet in this way

144
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
digital nationalism which

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
is that governments and other actors

146
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
inspired

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,879
by governments bringing nationalism

148
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,080
into online spaces and barricades as

149
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,800
spaces

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,639
um from foreign influence such as social

151
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,120
media platforms

152
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,960
stress to privacy and the data security

153
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
this is often a question you and i as a

154
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
consumer

155
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
ask when we use social media platforms

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
other online services and stress to

157
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,520
intellectual property

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,000
many of you here are probably very

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
familiar with defending

160
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
your organization's ip from cyber

161
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,599
enabled

162
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
economic astronauts

163
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
the last one is a vulnerability to

164
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,800
attacks

165
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
especially on critical infrastructure

166
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,919
such as

167
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,799
financial markets and power grids

168
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,599
because of an

169
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,200
open internet

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,880
other factors include include political

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
economic social and security factors

172
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,080
for in for example some nation states

173
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,800
and

174
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
interest groups criticizes the

175
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
historical reality that

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
the global internet is the us internet

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
and argues

178
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
that the u.s should not have what they

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,560
say

180
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,600
as undue power in the uh

181
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
formulation of internet governance

182
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
rights and standards

183
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
emerging technology and on top of the

184
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
internet has made some realize that

185
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
possible commercial benefits of

186
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
establishing individual tech ecosystems

187
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,320
such as original originally applicable

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
applications

189
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,399
people also draw on religious and

190
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
cultural factors in some regions

191
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,440
in their arguments for segmenting and

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
filtering

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
on the internet state

194
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,640
surveillance equipped with artificial

195
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
intelligence such as

196
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
official recognitions often use national

197
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
security reasons to protect cyber

198
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
sovereignty

199
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,880
this driving factor push broken

200
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
vulcanizing internet we also identified

201
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,040
legislations in some countries that also

202
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
face

203
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
a trend towards segmentation and

204
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,920
internal vulcanization

205
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,920
2017 we have seen many countries um

206
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
promulgate laws and regulations to gain

207
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
control over their citizens data

208
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
the one famous one and for example is a

209
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,000
the european

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
union's general data protection

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
regulations

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
or gdpr which mandates the storage

213
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,120
of eu data a citizen's data to be stored

214
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,760
on the

215
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
servers located within the eu

216
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,880
borders many of you may be familiar with

217
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,200
the

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,920
japan's act on the protection of

219
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
personal information

220
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,640
or appi and appear was adopted in 2003

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,360
which was

222
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,839
one of the first data protection

223
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,240
regulations in asia

224
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,279
the mandated appi um

225
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,320
introduced introduced in may

226
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,760
and 2017 after the major overhaul

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
because of several high profile

228
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,640
data breaches in june this year

229
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,040
the law a man amending the act

230
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,880
was enacted the new law expected to take

231
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
an effect in 2021 or the first

232
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
half of 2022 which further

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
strengthen rights for data subjects

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
and increasing and increase penalties

235
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,800
for

236
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
non-compliance

237
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,680
in the past few years more and more

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,399
governments

239
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,000
are increasingly resorting to

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
internet cut off in times of crisis

241
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
reasons behind the shutdown include

242
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,800
political and social stability

243
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
economic security of geosecurity

244
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,680
internet cut-off and practice also vary

245
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,399
some cut off the internet completely in

246
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
one region

247
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
all sever the region's connection with

248
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,519
the outside

249
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,160
world some may slow down internet

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,639
traffic

251
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,760
so users can not use certain social

252
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,279
media platforms

253
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,399
or live streaming content and some

254
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
establish a wholly separate internal

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,920
network so user can access only state

256
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,560
allowed

257
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,839
content one thing to remember

258
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
is that when governments shut down the

259
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
internet it's not just pushing

260
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,399
a button but involved involves

261
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,720
techniques

262
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
to manipulate the internet as i just

263
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,519
described

264
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,000
the main goal is to use the internet in

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
one's governing region

266
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,399
to silence or co-op and opposition

267
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,880
opposition political discourse or

268
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,519
prevent

269
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,639
active activists from using the internet

270
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,839
to organize

271
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,000
protests in a more

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,399
unmarket driven country the trend is

273
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
towards volcanization due to a geo

274
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,680
security

275
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,200
and economic security for example

276
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
a ban on internet components from a

277
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
particular country

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
on the grounds that country may be

279
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,399
putting malicious implants for

280
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,440
estimates this kind of

281
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
mutually exclusive development

282
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
could have much bigger impacts for the

283
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
internet organization

284
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,240
than just political asset isolation

285
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,160
as i mentioned some governments choose

286
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
whether to cut off the internet

287
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,519
entirely or to a region or whether to

288
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,480
selectively filter it many countries

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,360
have laws

290
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
and the regulations which government

291
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,440
could order internet service

292
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
or provider to shut down services or

293
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,720
take it on website or filtering content

294
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,839
u.s sanction is another example

295
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
sanctions such as restrictions on

296
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
foreign

297
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
foreign companies access to u.s

298
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
technology

299
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
will likely lead to the development of

300
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,240
separate and non-interoperable

301
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
technologies as technology decoupling

302
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
continues lastly

303
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
governments combine apps uh

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,680
in 2020 india banded

305
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,160
a total of 224 chinese apps

306
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,519
it is interesting to see that each times

307
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,959
when the government announced

308
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
a new ad ban many services

309
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,600
all offered indian alternatives with

310
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
those apps

311
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
what does a vulcanization for global

312
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
and what does a organization mean for

313
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,000
global businesses

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
the first implication is a cost

315
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,600
because the global pandemic this year

316
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
many businesses

317
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
are struggling to survive cutting costs

318
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,880
is definitely

319
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,240
one way to ensure business continuity

320
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,120
however to the extent that internet

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,000
standards

322
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,800
laws and technologies in each country

323
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
diverge from each other

324
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,639
organizations have to be aware related

325
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,440
costs

326
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
such as technical requirements for

327
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,519
each environment and the compliances

328
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,880
in each operating region would be costly

329
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,600
to meet

330
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
one by one also organizations may have

331
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,000
to spend

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,720
effort and time building segmented

333
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
network infrastructure localizing data

334
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
in each country and

335
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,160
integrating data across regions and

336
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
countries

337
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,680
lastly business operating

338
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
operating globally will have to make an

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,199
effort to

340
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,800
keep safe seamless online connectivities

341
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,079
for example

342
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,440
if one of your regional office offices

343
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,160
is in one a country where often

344
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,560
experience that internet cut off

345
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
you need to have a plan to ensure that

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,120
internet connectivities this plan may

347
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,480
involve actual budget to execute

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
the second implication is about supply

349
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,959
chains

350
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,679
in some countries we have observed the

351
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,520
government policies towards

352
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,959
restricting i.t technologies from other

353
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,480
countries

354
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,959
based on economic economic protectionism

355
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:33,840
all perceived in that

356
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,120
national security stress this tends to

357
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,919
disrupt supply chains

358
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,039
such policy first affected heart

359
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,799
technologies such as semiconductors

360
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,840
then moved to digital platforms

361
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
with such governments with some

362
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
governments arguing your platform

363
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,760
cannot operate in my area unless yours

364
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,000
operate in mine so finally

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,039
such policy also affect data as

366
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,320
many say data is a new oil

367
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,840
data has economic and political values

368
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,799
and everybody from governments and

369
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,160
businesses

370
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,679
even criminals and other actors have an

371
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
incentive to obtain data and

372
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,080
keep it for themselves to the extent

373
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,640
that

374
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,000
that this tendency continues the vulcan

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
nation would prevent

376
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,360
global companies from integrating data

377
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,080
across regions and the limits the

378
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,679
ability for business to

379
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,960
involve services and offer global scale

380
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,600
some would argue that if i cut my

381
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,919
country's technology supply chain off

382
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:56,720
completely

383
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,120
from other countries it would be hard

384
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,840
for structure to attack

385
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,320
supply chain risk management policy work

386
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,360
from this

387
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,720
idea however if we look at this from a

388
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
defensive point of view

389
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
if a nation state is able to build an

390
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,360
entirely autonomous supply chain

391
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
it would then attack other countries

392
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,799
supply chain without

393
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,919
worrying about its own supply chain

394
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,080
being affected

395
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,320
it is like creating a biological

396
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,799
weapon but making sure one's own

397
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,520
soldiers

398
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,840
are vaccinated against that passage

399
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,880
the third implication is about

400
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
market access restrictions

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,720
this year we are saying that government

402
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
have published

403
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,559
probations on so-called unreliable

404
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,280
entities

405
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,360
all export control laws to restrict acts

406
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
for

407
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,960
exports of controlled items to defend

408
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,480
national security and

409
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
interests all sub establish

410
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
an entity list with actual license

411
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,280
requirements

412
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,799
or review process for the export

413
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,080
or transfer of certain technologies

414
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,880
countries have long had restrictions on

415
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,280
do

416
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,280
use technologies fearing the export of

417
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,720
weaponized weapon weaponizable

418
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,760
weapon edible products to

419
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,840
hostile countries but the new

420
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,240
restrictions can

421
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,000
sharply in what were deeply

422
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,039
some symbiotic trade

423
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,320
in civilian products

424
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,640
this government strategies that deal

425
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
with regional supply chain issues would

426
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,080
likely lead to

427
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,158
market more fragmented

428
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
the fragmentation of market come with a

429
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,919
risk of

430
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,080
market access restrictions because

431
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,120
business may find that they have less

432
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,000
room to

433
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
maneuver as they examine their

434
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,280
operations for

435
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
setting up headquarters or expanding

436
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
markets

437
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,960
to certain countries in effect

438
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,159
government restrictions are increasingly

439
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,520
making market participation choices for

440
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
business

441
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,600
to a certain degree this may create

442
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
barriers for business growth and the

443
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
business scaling

444
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,679
especially for global businesses

445
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,039
the fourth implications about is about

446
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,159
data security and

447
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,280
cyber attack a vulcanizing internet will

448
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
likely increase data security risk

449
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
because each region has its own data

450
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
ecosystem

451
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,039
organizations need to strategize on

452
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,080
how to ensure the safety and integrity

453
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,720
of data

454
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,320
in regions where they operate

455
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,880
as the internet of organization proceeds

456
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,760
nation states

457
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
may be even more aggressive than before

458
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,360
to conduct

459
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,400
network operations in the segmented

460
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,280
system because it will be less likely to

461
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,720
affect their own system

462
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,360
here i have two case studies that could

463
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,080
provide

464
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
scenarios for a potential future

465
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,520
development

466
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,720
development previously i

467
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,000
mentioned that this year's indian indian

468
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,880
governments have

469
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,919
banned the total up to 224

470
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,600
mobile applications that they viewed as

471
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
harmful to

472
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,600
the sovereignty and integrity of india

473
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,280
as you may recall recall india

474
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,919
india and china have engaged in

475
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
increasingly

476
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,120
hostile rhetoric and even border

477
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,840
clashes this year this hostility

478
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,320
has spilled over to affect what was

479
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,280
formerly

480
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,840
a thriving economic relationship and the

481
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,240
trade

482
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,799
imagine if you are a global company that

483
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
operates in the region

484
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,679
have to deal with the ad ban the company

485
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,400
may have to examine its security policy

486
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,440
to see whether

487
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
it uses uses any of this apps

488
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
do you find alternatives if some of

489
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
these apps are used

490
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,280
in order to keep workflow and work

491
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,960
efficiency

492
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
also how about the communications if you

493
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,039
have

494
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,559
a bring your own devices policy

495
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,640
some employees may download an

496
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,559
alternative app

497
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,679
for communication then introduce malware

498
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,240
to your

499
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
networks

500
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,679
another um case scenarios is about

501
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
russian internet sovereignty law

502
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,240
this is a research report about russian

503
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,919
internet sovereignty law

504
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,640
published at a center eye defense

505
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,440
intergraph

506
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,520
portal in april 2019 when the law first

507
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
passed

508
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,240
russian internet sovereignty law

509
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
proposed

510
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,279
proposes the use of russian domain name

511
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,960
systems dns and the

512
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
the installation of deep pack

513
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
inspection equipment mapping

514
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,039
of routing systems and the centralized

515
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,320
control of the russian

516
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
segment of the internet

517
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,080
russian internet um sovereignty law

518
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,679
proposed

519
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
an alternative russian dns

520
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,159
setting fears that outside countries

521
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,440
could try to cut russia off

522
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,039
from the world internet

523
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,080
so if our country builds its own dns

524
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,440
system and no longer depends on dns

525
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,080
servers

526
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,039
in other countries it it could

527
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,000
potentially

528
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,360
unleash an attack on foreign servers

529
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,760
without different disruption to its own

530
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,360
internet segment

531
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,240
let's look at what an attack on dns

532
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
would look like

533
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,440
many of you may remember in october 2016

534
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,080
ddos attack on dan's dns provider died

535
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,120
eye defense reported the attack on

536
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,320
the day when it happened the damage

537
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
and the ddos attack was one of the

538
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,520
biggest

539
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,960
distributed denial service attack

540
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,320
ever launched some of uh

541
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
major uh u.s websites and web

542
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,039
web services have had connectivity

543
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
issues users were in panic

544
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,480
when it happened because they could not

545
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,799
connect to the social media they

546
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,559
um try to get on every day

547
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,360
and dyn lost roughly eight percent of

548
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,799
its customer base

549
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,840
in the aftermath of their tag

550
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,120
so information state have an alternative

551
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,559
dns the question that we should ponder

552
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
are so what is the possibility of a

553
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
potential backup to conduct

554
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,279
an offensive attack since the attack

555
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,840
only affect adversaries dns

556
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,760
this is increasing possibility of a

557
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,640
large-scale

558
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
cyber attack because of segmented

559
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,440
internet it

560
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,559
is it increasing difficult

561
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,919
of tracing this information operators

562
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,720
because the dns alternatives would set

563
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,640
barriers to trace

564
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
a tow farm back to its

565
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,840
national origin

566
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,880
so how can companies survive

567
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,399
a vulcanizing internet

568
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,279
here i will suggest a few ways you can

569
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:33,840
prepare

570
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,080
yourself for an increasingly fragmented

571
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,640
legal and technological internet

572
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,279
landscape

573
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,919
as i discussed previously about some

574
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,520
indicator we have seen

575
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,880
in the case scenarios here i list

576
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,399
a few examples of practical actions to

577
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,600
architect for

578
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
vulcanizing internet to cope with and

579
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,640
foresee

580
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,720
geopolitical shifts for example

581
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,080
regional policies and laws may prevent

582
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,600
cross-border authentications so your

583
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
organizer may need to consider

584
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,720
implementing originally isolated

585
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
active directory another example

586
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,080
since some countries require user data

587
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,960
to reside

588
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,240
in their country of residence

589
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
regional data governance strategies

590
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,279
should be

591
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,799
customer faded to each region's current

592
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,799
and emerging landscape

593
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,159
maintaining awareness to survive

594
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,880
since the trends in internet

595
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,320
connectivity

596
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,840
connectedness are constantly constantly

597
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,960
involving maintaining awareness of

598
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
cyber security cyber

599
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
cyber security campaigns and policy

600
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,919
initiatives

601
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,399
that are relevant to your business

602
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,440
operations

603
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,919
including local national and

604
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,080
multilateral initiatives will

605
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,159
help your organizations to plan ahead

606
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,720
also be aware of any cyber strike

607
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,520
activities

608
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,880
targeting your industry all operating

609
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
regions

610
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
analyze and utilize any cyber threat

611
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,399
intelligence from

612
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,120
those right activities so you can better

613
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,679
defend

614
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,720
your networks

615
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,880
some other proactive measures that your

616
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
organization

617
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,600
your organizations can take include

618
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,159
conduct

619
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
table a tabletop exercise

620
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,919
identify indicator of internet

621
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,840
isolations in the country

622
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,520
where you operate use worst case

623
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,320
scenarios to test your organization's

624
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,159
readiness for possible further

625
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
isolations in the country

626
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,360
in the future consider a job

627
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,480
a graphic i'm sorry because

628
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
consider a geopolitical strike

629
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
intelligence program

630
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,200
even just hiring one knowledgeable

631
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,240
expert

632
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,279
if you don't already have such a program

633
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,080
lastly participating in the industry

634
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
