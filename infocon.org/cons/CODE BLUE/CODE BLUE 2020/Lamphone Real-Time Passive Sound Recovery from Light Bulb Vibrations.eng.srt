00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,479
and let me start by introducing myself

13
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,320
my name is ben i'm a computer scientist

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
and former google employee

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
i'm a phd student at bengal university

bgu

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
my research focuses on security and

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
privacy of iot devices

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,080
and you can read more about my research

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,880
at my website

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,759
this is a joint work made with the help

23
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,799
of

24
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,840
javon professor adishamir professor and

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,479
dr bob

26
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
zadow all of us from bengal university

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
and weizmann institute of science

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
let's review the agenda for today and we

29
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,960
will start by discussing the research

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,159
question

31
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,920
we will then continue to understand the

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
necessary

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,079
background to understand how landform

34
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,560
actually operates

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
we will continue by discussing landforms

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
threat model

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,000
and we will then analyze how bulbs can

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
be used as microphones

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
we will continue by uh i will continue

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,240
by showing you the

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
evaluation from the experiments that we

42
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,160
did we will discuss about potential

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
improvements

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
uh we will discuss about the primary

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
takeaway from this research and at the

46
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,720
end will be the q a

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,840
okay so the first question that i want

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
to ask you is

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
can a hanging bulb be used as the

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,239
microphone

51
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
and my answer to you is by using

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
scientific tools to analyze the

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
vibrations of a hanging bulb

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,200
attackers or eavesdroppers can recover

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
high quality

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
speech and non-speech audio

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
and i will start with a warning turning

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,599
hanging light bulb into a microphone is

59
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,120
very challenging

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
and probably some of you are asking

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
yourself why

62
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,640
and the primary reason is because light

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
bulbs were not exactly designed to be

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
used as microphones so

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
during the next 30 minutes i will try to

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,159
convince you that factors can

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
exploit the vibrations of a hanging

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,080
light bulb

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
and turn it to a microphone if they all

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,440
know

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,239
what to look for

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
okay the background and let's start with

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
the understanding what the sound wave

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
is and a sound wave is l traveling

75
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,120
through space

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
the source is some object that causes a

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
vibration for example

78
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,360
a person vocal cords and acoustic waves

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
that have frequencies from

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
around 20 health to 20 kilohertz

81
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
can be held by humans

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,920
now eavesdropping is the act of secretly

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
recovering sound from a target victim or

84
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
a target

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,440
or from any target without

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,519
his consent this is by the way a

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
definition taken from

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,599
peria and if stopping can be performed

89
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
digitally and physically and in this

90
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
research we actually

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,560
focus on a physical method to

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
apply if uh eavesdropping and physical

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
eavesdropping relies on objects that are

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
located in physical proximity

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,360
to the sound source and when sound

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,920
and when some wave hits the surface of

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
an object

98
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,519
causes the object to vibrate and by

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,639
analyzing the object

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,798
the object's response to sound the

101
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,400
vibrations

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
with the purple device or a sensor sound

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,639
can be recovered

104
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
okay so let's understand how microphones

105
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,840
they work and

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,560
microphones are devices that are used to

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
convert

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,639
sound waves to electrical signals and

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
they rely on

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
the free next family components

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
the first component is a diaphragm which

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
is a thin piece of material that

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
vibrates when it is

114
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
struck by sound waves the second

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
component is a transducer which is used

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,120
to convert

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,160
a diaphragm's vibrations to a current

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
and the last component is a to d which

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
is used

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,039
to sample the analog electric signal at

121
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
the standard audio samples

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
audio sample it's

123
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,960
in in recent years the scientific

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,680
community

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
has suggested various ways to recover

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
sound

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
and all of the methods basically can be

128
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
categorized into one of the

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
two next categories the first category

130
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,840
is internal methods and the second

131
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,639
category is

132
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,280
external methods and let's understand

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,759
the differences between them

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
internal methods are methods that rely

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,199
on data

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,600
obtained by a device located in physical

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,890
proximity to a victim

138
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,960
[Music]

139
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,639
and recent studies have demonstrated

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
that motion sensors that are integrated

141
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
to smartphones

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
and speakers and even vibration motors

143
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,199
all of which

144
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,880
are integrated to smartphone nowadays

145
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,639
can be used to recover

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
sound and from the stopper perspective

147
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
these methods are

148
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,319
permissionless which means that

149
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,759
applications that implement these

150
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
methods do not require

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
any permissions to obtain data from the

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
devices

153
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
however such methods require the

154
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
attacker to place a malware

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
or compromise the device that is located

156
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
near a victim for example

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
a smartphone in order to obtain the data

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
and to execute the data

159
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
so this is a great disadvantage of

160
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,120
such methods now external methods

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,479
are the second category of studies in

162
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,960
this

163
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
area and these are methods that rely on

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
data obtained by a device

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
that is not located near a victim

166
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,639
and one good example is the laser

167
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,160
microphone

168
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
which uses a laser concealer to recover

169
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,599
sound

170
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
by directing a laser beam at an object

171
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
and analyzing the object's response to

172
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
sound

173
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,599
and from the ifs of a perspective this

174
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,240
method is external

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,120
which means that it doesn't require the

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
leaf stopper to place a malware or to

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
compromise

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,680
a device that is located near the victim

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
and also this method can be applied in

180
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
real time

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
however this method greatest

182
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,680
disadvantage is the fact that it is

183
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
active

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
the laser beam can be detected by

185
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
victims by using a dedicated optical

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
sensor that

187
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
detects the laser beam that is used

188
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,479
and the second method in this category

189
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
of external methods

190
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,639
is the visual microphone now the visual

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,440
microphone

192
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
the visual microphone introduced six

193
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,800
years ago

194
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
six years ago by a group of scientists

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
from mit

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,599
they showed that high frequency video

197
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,639
camera

198
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
can be used to recover sound by

199
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
analyzing

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
the object response to sound they show

201
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
that a bag of ships for example can be

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,199
used to recover speech

203
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,319
and from the installer perspective this

204
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,960
method

205
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
greatest advantage are the fact that

206
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,199
this method is external

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,400
again it doesn't require the articles to

208
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
compromise the device that is located

209
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
near the victim

210
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
also as opposed to the laser microphone

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,720
this method is passive

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
uh which make uh its detection very

213
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,799
difficult for victims of

214
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
organizations however this method

215
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
greatest disadvantage is the fact that

216
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
it cannot be applied in real time

217
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,320
because it requires heavy computational

218
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,839
resources it takes

219
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,279
a few hours to recover a few seconds of

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,080
sound okay let's summarize the

221
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
section of the related world as i

222
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
mentioned before there are

223
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
two categories the internal methods and

224
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
the external methods

225
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
and from the if stopper perspective each

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
method is limited by one of the

227
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
following characteristics

228
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,880
uh some relies on remotely controlled

229
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
device which required the attacker to

230
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
one of the if server to compromise the

231
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
device

232
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
with the malware a device that's located

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
near the victim

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
another disadvantage is the fact that

235
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
some are active which makes them which

236
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,160
makes it easier for the victim to detect

237
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
the use of the method and some cannot be

238
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
applied in real time because

239
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,320
um the method requires heavy

240
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
computational resources

241
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
now let's review length and spread model

242
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
and

243
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,760
level is a method to recover sound by

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,839
analyzing the vibration of a hanging

245
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,200
bulb with

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
optical sensor and we assume that the

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,720
hanging

248
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,680
light bulb exists in a target

249
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,200
and a sound in the room which

250
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,079
can be the result of a conversation

251
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
creates fluctuations on the surface of

252
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,760
the hanging valve

253
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
and actually turned into a diaphragm

254
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
now the eavesdropper directs an

255
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
electro-optical sensor

256
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,200
at the handling valve vi telescope and

257
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
as a result

258
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,279
the diaphragm now um turned into a

259
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,200
transducer

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
the optical the optical signal is

261
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
sampled from the electro optical sensor

262
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
via an a2d

263
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
and process using a dedicated sound

264
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,320
recovery algorithm

265
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,680
into acoustic signal

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
now from an each dropper perspective

267
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
length on spread model is

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,760
external passive and as i will show you

269
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,600
in few slides it can also be applied in

270
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,079
real time

271
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
now let's review uh our let's analyze

272
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
how

273
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
light bulbs can be used as microphones

274
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
as i mentioned before some wave

275
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,079
is traveling through space the air

276
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,720
causes

277
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,160
a hanging light bulb to vibrate

278
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,279
uh however above the vibrations are so

279
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,079
small that

280
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,120
they are invisible to the human eye so

281
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
the first question that we try to answer

282
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,839
is how small are these vibrations

283
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,839
now in order to answer this question we

284
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,839
actually conduct an experiment

285
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,320
we attached a gyroscope to the bottom of

286
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
the hanging ball

287
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
and we produced various sound waves at

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
different volumes at three

289
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,519
levels of the volumes from the speakers

290
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,000
to the right and we sampled the

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
gyroscope at

292
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
800 hertz using gasoline pipe3 again you

293
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,319
can see the elastic

294
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
now here are the results we computed the

295
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,959
angle as the function of the frequency

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,680
and when i

297
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
say the frequency i mean the sign the

298
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
assignment that was

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
played for fee and for theta and you can

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,279
see here theta

301
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,360
on the screen to the left and

302
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
we analyzed the results and we actually

303
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
concluded the following

304
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
regarding the angle of vibrations uh the

305
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,279
angular vibration

306
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,160
is very small uh it is in milli degrees

307
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
as you can see in the

308
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,959
features at the bottom as you can see

309
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,079
the

310
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,519
uh angular vibration is not equal

311
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
it changes as a function of the

312
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,120
frequency

313
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,880
and another insight and unsurprising

314
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
insight is that

315
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,360
the angle vibration increases as the

316
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
volume increases

317
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
you can see it again in the picture

318
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,800
below

319
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,600
so based on the known formula of the

320
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
spherical coordinate system

321
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
we computed the total movement taking

322
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,200
into account

323
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
fee theta and the distance between the

324
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
ceiling and the bottom of the

325
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
hanging valve and these are the results

326
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,200
that

327
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
were obtained uh sound affected the

328
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,959
hanging bulb

329
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,079
causing it to vibrate at 300 microns to

330
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,839
950 microns between the range the

331
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
range you can see the picture to the

332
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
right

333
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
now we actually try to answer another

334
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,959
question can we detect the movement

335
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,120
of microbes by using an electro-optical

336
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,320
sensor

337
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
so in order to answer it we actually

338
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
conduct another experiment where we

339
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,839
try to we actually direct the

340
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,440
electro-optical sensor

341
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,480
toward a hanging light bulb and when it

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,839
was illuminated

343
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,680
and we measured the voltage that was

344
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
produced by the electro optical sensor

345
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
from various distances

346
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,320
from one meter to 9.5 meters

347
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,760
and the graph to the right showing the

348
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,959
results

349
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,560
uh a different amount of voltage is

350
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
produced by the electro optical sensor

351
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,079
when the sensor is placed

352
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
you can see for example at two meters

353
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,199
and

354
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,920
the six meters you can see that the

355
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,639
amount of

356
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
voltage decreases

357
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
as a result of the fact that light

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,959
deteriorates with distance

359
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,639
and this is probably the best time to

360
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
uh indicate to know that

361
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
this is good results however we are

362
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,160
interested in

363
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,519
measuring small movements of the bulb

364
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
rather than large movements of the

365
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,680
sensors of the sensor

366
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,720
and another

367
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,839
uh question that we try to ask is

368
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,160
how can we how how can the amount of

369
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,880
light

370
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
expected for displacement of microns be

371
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
computed from

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,800
this experiment so in order to answer it

373
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
we actually did

374
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,639
the following process uh we computed

375
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
linear equations between two consecutive

376
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,519
points

377
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,279
on the graph you can see the graph the

378
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,720
right scope was was

379
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
created in the previous experiment and

380
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,399
you can see the linear equations

381
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,800
below and based on the linear equations

382
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
we computed the expected voltage

383
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
resulting from displacement of

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,920
300 microns and 950 microns

385
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
and you can see the expected voltage

386
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
difference

387
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,000
and in order to set a criteria we

388
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,959
first try to understand what level of

389
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,759
sensitivity can for example 16-bit a2d

390
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,600
provide and we computed the sensitivity

391
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
of 16-bit as follows

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,759
a 16-bit a2d provides a sensitivity of

393
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,480
microvolts you can see the computation

394
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
here

395
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
and the first conclusion that we made

396
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,440
from this observation is that

397
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
sensitivity of

398
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
300 microvolts is sufficient to recover

399
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,880
the entire

400
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
measured spectrum from for example a

401
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
distance of

402
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
two and a half meters and this is

403
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
because the smallest vibration that

404
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,079
expected in this

405
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
range produces a difference of 300

406
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
microvolts which

407
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,600
is actually the sensitivity of 16-bit

408
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
we used in our experiment

409
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
however another interesting conclusion

410
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
that we made is that

411
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
in order to detect above vibration from

412
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
a greater distance

413
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
the sensitivity of the system needs to

414
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,320
be increased

415
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,800
or the signal obtained needs to be

416
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,759
amplified

417
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,199
and at the end of the talk i will

418
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
discuss and

419
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
uh i will uh explain how each of which

420
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,880
can actually be satisfied

421
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,480
okay so i want to show you the

422
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
evaluation from the result from

423
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
the experiment that we did and

424
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,759
this is the experimental setup we

425
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,839
evaluated length performance recovering

426
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,040
sound from a bridge

427
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,079
located 25 meters from an office

428
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,360
you can see the bridge and you can see

429
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
the office

430
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,039
below and the office contains a 12 volt

431
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,039
e27 hanging light bulb

432
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
and i want to show you the experimental

433
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:19,839
setup in a video

434
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,480
okay so the sound the sound that was

435
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,960
played

436
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,559
inside the office cannot be held from

437
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
the bridge the blade is located

438
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,799
on top of the rail station and there's a

439
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,080
great ambient

440
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
noise and

441
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
the first experiment that we did is we

442
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,720
tried to characterize the baseline

443
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
and we conducted an experiment when we

444
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,799
obtained optical measurements via the

445
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,960
electro-optical sensor when no sound was

446
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
played in the office

447
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
and these are the results we found that

448
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,840
the led bulb which works at

449
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,600
the led bulb uh works at 100 health and

450
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
we found that there are peaks

451
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
as a result on the f50 graph at each of

452
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
the harmonics

453
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
at 200 300 etc and

454
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
the first conclusion that we made is

455
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
that we need to feed this noise

456
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,120
with bend stop filters because this is a

457
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,039
side effect and this is not the result

458
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,679
of

459
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,600
sound also we found that there is

460
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
a noise at low frequencies you can see

461
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
it in here

462
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,320
below 50 hertz this is the result by the

463
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
way of

464
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,679
the natural vibration of the bridge

465
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,360
which is located on top of a rail

466
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
station

467
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
and we concluded that we need to filter

468
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,960
this noise with the hypospital

469
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
and this all the conclusion that we made

470
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,919
from

471
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,880
this experiment now the second

472
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
experiment that we did is we try to

473
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
analyze the frequency response

474
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,640
and we did the following experiment we

475
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
actually obtained optical

476
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
measurements via the electro-optical

477
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,679
sensor when the frequency scan was

478
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,320
played

479
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,120
via speakers in proximity to the hanging

480
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,039
valve

481
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,720
and we actually obtained the

482
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
optical measurements via three uh

483
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
telescopes with the

484
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,559
a telescope with the 10 centimeter lens

485
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,600
of the the

486
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
10 system 10 centimeter lens 20

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
centimeter lens and 35 centimeter lens

488
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,360
and first we found that the signal to

489
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,640
noise ratio

490
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
improves when a telescope with a bigger

491
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
lens is used

492
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,880
i will explain it uh in few slides for

493
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
now the reason for this

494
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
uh for this result and

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,679
the second conclusion that we also made

496
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,799
and you can see it again

497
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,559
at the figure at the left

498
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,120
is that the signal to noise ratio is not

499
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
equal across the spectrum

500
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
and we actually conclude that an

501
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,240
equalizer

502
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,520
needs to be applied in order to

503
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,120
balance the frequency response of the

504
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
recover signal you can see the

505
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
equalizer that was used in the rest of

506
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
the experiment to the right

507
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,880
okay so we first

508
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
we started by uh testing

509
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,960
the performance of landform at the test

510
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,039
of recovering non-speech audio

511
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,360
and we actually conduct an experiment

512
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
where we played

513
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
two famous songs inside the office the

514
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
first song is let it be by the beatles

515
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
and the second song is clocks by

516
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,480
coldplay

517
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,240
and we obtain the optical measurements

518
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,880
and we cover the signals

519
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,559
and you can see here the spectrograms of

520
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,240
the row signal at the left to the left

521
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
the recovered signal

522
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
in the middle and the original signal

523
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
on the right and for many of you the

524
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
spectrograms are nice but they are not

525
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,039
the

526
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,240
same a lot so let me play you

527
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
then we covered the audio

528
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,280
and we actually shazam they recovered

529
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
the signals and i'm about to show you

530
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,919
that

531
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,600
the recovered signals are in high

532
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
quality and they are

533
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:31,840
both recognized by shazam

534
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
uh

535
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,159
as you can see from both videos both

536
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,200
are both the recovered the non-speech

537
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,919
audio

538
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,840
is in high quality and they'll both

539
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,039
recognized by shazam

540
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,290
okay so we continue to

541
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,360
[Music]

542
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,320
test the performance of landform on the

543
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,559
task of recovering the speech audio

544
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
and we actually conduct another

545
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
experiment where we played a famous

546
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,799
statement

547
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,039
made by donald trump we will make

548
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,799
america great again

549
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,480
we obtained the optical measurements and

550
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,760
we recovered the signals

551
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,320
and again the low signal the optical

552
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,639
signal

553
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
on the left side uh the recovery signal

554
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
is

555
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
in the middle and the original signal is

556
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
on the right side

557
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
and we actually investigated whether the

558
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,200
recovered signal

559
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,960
could be transcribed by google's speech

560
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,240
to text engine

561
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
and i want to play to you and show you

562
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,840
that google's text

563
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,440
google speech to text engine was able to

564
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,640
the sentence correctly

565
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
so as you can see i think that many of

566
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
you were able to

567
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
kill president trump and understand what

568
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
exactly uh he says

569
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,000
and also as you can see google was able

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,320
to

571
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,840
transcribe president trump correctly

572
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,400
okay so i want us to understand the

573
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,799
potential improvements that

574
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,360
attackers can employ to this method and

575
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,720
first of all as i showed you before

576
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,440
uh using a telescope with the larger

577
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,799
lens diameter actually

578
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
improves the signal to noise ratio and

579
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
this is because

580
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
more amount of light is being captured

581
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,360
by the electrode

582
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
similar to sensors ratio another

583
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
potential improvement is to use

584
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,480
uh a better or more sensitive electro

585
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,679
optical sensor

586
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,440
than the one that we used in the our

587
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,240
experiments or for example use

588
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,960
multiple electrolyte electro optical

589
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,919
sensor for

590
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,640
multi-channel audio recovery which is a

591
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
common

592
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,120
approach in audio processing

593
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
another improvement is to use an a2d

594
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,840
with a lower noise level

595
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,400
or to use a more sensitive a2d than the

596
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,520
one that we used in

597
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,799
our experiments and

598
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,640
another improvement that can be applied

599
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,360
is to use

600
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,000
some more complex filtering techniques

601
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
to filter the noise

602
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
we actually use some very simple uh

603
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,559
methods in our uh to recover

604
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,320
a sound and there is there are great

605
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
and new algorithms that provide

606
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,039
new techniques and some advanced

607
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
techniques to filter noise from

608
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
a signal for example depending is only

609
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,400
one of them

610
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
okay so the primary takeaway that i want

611
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,159
you to take from

612
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,600
this talk is that um it is

613
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,240
now 2020 but by i want you to mark 2026

614
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
on your calendars

615
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
and some of you are probably asking

616
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
yourself why and i want us to examine

617
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,080
jericho's scientific progress in order

618
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,270
to

619
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,600
[Music]

620
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,640
explain to you in order to answer the

621
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
question of why

622
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,919
and gyrophone uh for many of you doesn't

623
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,960
says a lot

624
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,559
but at 2014 the attack vector of

625
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,520
eavesdropping

626
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,520
via motion sensor was revealed and

627
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,120
it was revealed by a group of scientists

628
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
from stanford and they named it

629
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,240
gyrophone and they

630
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
basically back then

631
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
suggested a classification model to

632
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,840
classify isolated the

633
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,799
words details result which are only

634
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,960
slightly better than the random guess

635
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
and also the attack vector of geraldton

636
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,080
relied on speech

637
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,200
at the high volume as in the case of

638
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,840
length and if i will have to play

639
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
channel from the scale of non-practical

640
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,880
to highly practical

641
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
i would i would consider trial phone as

642
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,200
uh back then six years ago is

643
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,880
not practical and mainly this is uh

644
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,559
uh because of the two uh

645
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
the two ways and that i just mentioned

646
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
however

647
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,159
during the next years increased

648
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
understanding regarding this

649
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,039
architect was gained and the accuracy of

650
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,840
the classification model improved

651
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,559
significantly and some better

652
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,799
understanding regarding the experimental

653
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,760
setup was gained and this was thanks to

654
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,159
two

655
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,000
other studies that were conducted

656
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,480
between 2015 to 2018 and

657
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,600
and this year

658
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,640
the attack vector was improved to

659
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
make it a real practical threat to

660
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,000
privacy

661
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,679
a recent study from ndss it was able to

662
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,799
present

663
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,200
to optimize this method and presented a

664
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
classification model with

665
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
excellent accuracy and also the attack

666
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
vector is now relies

667
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,799
on speech of the normal volume

668
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,360
so analyzing the scientific progress

669
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,799
that jericho made through

670
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,000
the last six years we actually concluded

671
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
it took scientists

672
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
six years to improve gyrophone to the

673
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,480
point that it

674
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,600
now poses a reference to privacy and

675
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,840
my forecast is that by 2026

676
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,039
scientists will improve landform so

677
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,480
it will also pose a reference to privacy

678
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
and in my opinion lenovo is somewhere in

679
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,880
the middle between

680
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,440
non-practical to highly practical and

681
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
it's basically an evolution of a visual

682
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,559
microphone

683
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,399
however i do believe that somewhere in

684
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,279
the next maybe two or three years

685
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,000
you will find out or you will hear about

686
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,360
another research

687
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,880
that was able to recover sound from

688
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
light and they were probably going to be

689
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
