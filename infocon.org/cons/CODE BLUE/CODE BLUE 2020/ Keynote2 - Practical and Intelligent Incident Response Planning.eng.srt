1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
my

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,840
a great keynote

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
he previously also has helped some

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,640
trainings of black hat japan

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,239
ross rogers

6
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
please

7
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,559
good afternoon my name is russ rogers

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
i'm a forensics expert

9
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,520
and incident response team lead from

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,199
microsoft corporation

11
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,880
and today i'd like to speak to you a

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
little bit about practical incident

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
response

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
so who am i um as i said before i work

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,119
for microsoft and i'm

16
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,200
excited and honored to be speaking at

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
code blue this year

18
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,720
my focus is mainly forensics

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,119
on windows and on linux operating system

20
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,680
i'm a researcher a developer as well as

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,479
an author

22
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
a professor and a hacker if you've been

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,119
to black hat and defcon there's a

24
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,640
good chance that you've seen me in the

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
past

26
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
so let's start and talk a little bit

27
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,840
about the instant response timeline

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
how do these engagements typically flow

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
so we start with the initial compromise

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,799
of a customer's network system so the

31
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
initial compromise may be weeks months

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,280
or

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
years old by the time it's discovered

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
and in many cases we'll find multiple

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
actors on the same network

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
with incidents that span 8-12 months

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
that have happened years in the past as

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,239
well

39
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,640
we can still find indicators of the the

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
malware

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
and the tools that they used when they

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
were in the network

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,959
doing some of the work that we'll

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
discuss today

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
um after we've done after we've detected

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
the compromise we kind of move into the

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,640
response

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,080
phase and you can you can conduct the

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
response on your own

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,640
or you can hire an outside contractor to

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
do the work for you

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
the response time depends a lot on your

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
selected mode of operation

54
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,599
right so there are quicker response

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
activities

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,360
that normally take one to three weeks

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
max

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,959
slower response activities can take

59
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,400
several months

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
and we want to answer the key questions

61
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,760
here about who

62
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,560
what how why and when

63
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,800
once we've kind of got a handle on all

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
those questions and we have answers that

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,319
we can provide to those we

66
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
move into a tactical recovery and the

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,040
tactical recovery is where we plan and

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,200
execute the eviction of the attacker

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,480
from the network

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
we use the output from the response

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,000
phase

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
to plan both the tactical recovery and

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
the phase that comes after tactical

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
recovery

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
and what we do during the response

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
is to identify c2 connections

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
we identify compromised user accounts

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,879
credentials compromise systems whether

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
those be workstations

80
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
or servers to identify any compromised

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
cloud assets that we may be using and we

82
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,760
use

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,200
that information to evict the hacker and

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
lock down the network as best we can

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
and get the business operational in a

86
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,640
secure environment

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
once that's done we move it over to the

88
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,400
strategic recovery

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
and the strategic recovery is a

90
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
long-term process

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
where the organization focuses on

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,599
strategic

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
plans to improve the security posture of

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,239
the organization and

95
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,279
to lock down some of the systemic issues

96
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
that the organization has when it comes

97
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
to security

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,360
and this includes auditing and logging

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,639
incident response

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,919
incident detection the monitoring both

101
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,040
on the network

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
and on the endpoints of the network

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,919
so the questions these are the questions

104
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,199
we're interested in

105
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,800
in answering as we go through this

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
process first how did the attackers get

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
in what was that initial

108
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
vector that allowed them to gain a

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
foothold

110
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,560
with credentials and on a system and why

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
didn't we detect that compromise when it

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,840
initially occurred

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
when did they get in how long have they

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
been in the network this is important to

115
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
understand

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,960
because it helps us determine how far

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,560
they could have gotten in the network in

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
a period of time

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,919
we'll give you as much information we

120
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,520
can so that you can make those

121
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
determinations on your own

122
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
once we respond to the incident we get

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,639
on site

124
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,320
we want to understand what the actors

125
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
are doing right now

126
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,080
what are their current activities what

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
systems are they in

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,160
what activities are they performing what

129
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
other accounts do they have what data

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
have they accessed

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
have they exfiltrated any of our

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
critical information

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,919
right what malware did the actors use

134
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,880
and now it's important to delineate or

135
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,600
differentiate between malware

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
and binaries that exist on a network for

137
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
system administrators that may allow

138
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
attackers to do what they need to on the

139
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,759
network

140
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
and we call those living off the land

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
binaries or low bin

142
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,400
um and then finally we want to

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
understand if the attackers have

144
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
actually taken anything have they gotten

145
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
any intellectual property have they

146
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,280
stolen

147
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,039
any customer data that that's important

148
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,960
for you to understand as you respond to

149
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
these things

150
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,199
let's talk a little bit about the types

151
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,440
of response the first type i'm going to

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
talk about is the traditional instant

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,199
response that we're used to talking

154
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,360
about and this is the digital forensics

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
incident response

156
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
or defer this is a slow process

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
it requires deep forensics on

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
dead box images that have been captured

159
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,319
off of workstations or servers

160
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
right so we'll go we'll make a hard disk

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,840
image

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
and we'll conduct all of our work on a

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
copy of that image

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
so that we don't destroy any of the

165
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
original

166
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
artifacts that exist in that image the

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
reason we did this

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
is it created a chain of custody and it

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
allowed us in the beginning

170
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
to not only identify the attackers but

171
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
to potentially seek legal action against

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,160
those attackers

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
do we want to put somebody in jail for

174
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,440
attacking our network

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
it's understandable that this process

176
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,560
because of the way it functions

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,880
it will be more expensive it will be

178
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
more time

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,880
intensive and it will cost more money to

180
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,479
conduct because it takes

181
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,360
longer but this process allows you to

182
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,080
understand

183
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
all of the details it's a comprehensive

184
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
view of

185
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
what happened

186
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,639
the second type of instant response is

187
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
the one that we typically

188
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
prefer within microsoft for our

189
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
customers this

190
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,960
is an instant response with

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
a forensics overlay that does not

192
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
require

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
the process to image every single

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,759
workstation or server

195
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,240
we conduct this process typically in two

196
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
to three weeks

197
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
maximum and we focus primarily on the

198
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
key indicators compromise

199
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,360
again those accounts the systems

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
the malware that was used any of the

201
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
binaries that exist um

202
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
and the command and control right we we

203
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,520
call these things together kind of the

204
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
tools tactics and processes that are

205
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
used by the attackers or the ttps

206
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
this is often less expensive because

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
it doesn't take as many people it

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,759
doesn't take as long

209
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
to complete and it should give us

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
all of the information that we need to

211
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
move into the tactical response and lock

212
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,799
the network down

213
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,719
and get the actors evicted from the

214
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,200
network again the goal here

215
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
is to identify those key indicators as

216
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
quickly as possible

217
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
and to lock the network down again so

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
that your business

219
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,000
can get back to operating in a secure

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,480
environment

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
so which process is best for you so this

222
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,720
comes down

223
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
to a risk-based decision by your senior

224
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,320
leadership

225
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
you're going to have to make a decision

226
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
about whether we want to spend a lot of

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,680
time

228
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
pursuing this incident do we want to

229
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,760
know absolutely everything

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,640
or are we good enough understanding the

231
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
important

232
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,120
aspects of our network you know mostly

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
how did they get in

234
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
what did they do while they were there

235
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
what tools did they use what accounts

236
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
are compromised what machines are at

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,279
risk

238
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
and we can take all that information and

239
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,640
we can

240
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
combine it with any configuration issues

241
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,720
on servers or services on the network

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,399
and we can lock the network down and

243
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,760
evict the actor

244
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,160
again it really depends on what your end

245
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,959
goal here

246
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,800
is so recognizing a compromise

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
this is really important to recognize

248
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,320
what's

249
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,200
different in a network we must first

250
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,920
understand

251
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
what is normal in the network so we're

252
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,839
going to talk a little bit about

253
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,519
normalizing your network we want to

254
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,079
create a baseline of network traffic

255
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
of system configurations times that

256
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,240
users

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,959
access applications or the network where

258
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,760
they access

259
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
the network from items like that

260
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,440
so the goal here is to prepare now to be

261
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,839
more effective later if we spend the

262
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,720
time up front before a compromise

263
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
to normalize and baseline the network

264
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
and collect that information

265
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
then when a compromise occurs we are

266
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,640
better suited

267
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
to respond to that and we'll be more

268
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
capable of identifying those things that

269
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
are unique

270
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,320
on the network and we want

271
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,440
auditing and monitoring data

272
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,079
the availability of historical data from

273
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,600
systems and applications

274
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
and network devices can help us identify

275
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,640
how

276
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,920
and when the attack began if we don't

277
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
have this historical data when we start

278
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
the incident response process we're

279
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
going to

280
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
find it very difficult to complete the

281
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
story of what happened

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,800
and that includes that zero day um the

283
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,839
that patient zero if you were

284
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,800
of this is the user account on this

285
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
machine

286
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,480
that was sent a phishing attack with

287
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,880
this

288
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
exploit that gave the attackers a way to

289
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
get into the network

290
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
and so if we ensure the auditing and the

291
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
monitoring

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,399
is being conducted and that data is

293
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,760
being saved

294
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
for a reasonable period of time it gives

295
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
us

296
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
a step forward to

297
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
make our instant response activities

298
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,279
more successful

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
so what's normal let's talk about what

300
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
we're looking for

301
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
so we want to understand some of these

302
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
key points

303
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
how are the user workstations configured

304
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
and are they all built exactly the same

305
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
if the workstations are built all the

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
same and the users have access to

307
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,240
all the same approved software and

308
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
they're not allowed to install their own

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
software applications

310
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,440
then when we find unique pieces of

311
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,800
software that are not

312
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
on the approved list

313
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
those things stand out and the same is

314
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,560
true with server configurations

315
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,600
do we have a gold image

316
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
a server image of say the windows server

317
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,760
operating system

318
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,880
that is normalized things we know should

319
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
be on there

320
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,519
configurations that we know are secure

321
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,519
and what what happens on those servers

322
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
as they're operating right we want to

323
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
understand what's normal

324
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,000
allowed applications do we have

325
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
application white listing again this

326
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,519
goes back to

327
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
we have a list of applications we know

328
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,279
that our users need

329
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,920
to conduct their business and those are

330
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,519
the ones that we allow on the network

331
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,760
anything outside of that range

332
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,320
gets reviewed and approved on a periodic

333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,519
basis by a configuration control board

334
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
what are the normal business hours

335
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
where do normal connections come from

336
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,399
from external addresses

337
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
right so if we have

338
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,079
users working from home during this

339
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,880
pandemic

340
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,519
and they work from specific regions have

341
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
we identified

342
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
the ip addresses or the networks that

343
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,680
those connections are coming from

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
and what times a day do they normally

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
log in

346
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,760
we need to identify authorized

347
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
privileged accounts

348
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,399
like backup operators domain

349
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,680
administrator

350
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,519
enterprise administrator things like

351
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
that and this applies to

352
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,760
cloud accounts as well things like

353
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
global administrator or account

354
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,519
administrators in o365 or in azure

355
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,760
active directory

356
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
we also want to identify all the

357
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,079
existing trust relationships do we have

358
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,800
partners do we have subsidiary

359
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
organizations

360
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
of the same company that we work with

361
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,680
are there two-way trusts or is it a

362
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,880
one-way trust

363
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
and is there sid filtering is there a

364
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,279
mechanism to ensure

365
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
that a domain administrator on

366
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
a partner network is unable to come into

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,360
our network as a domain administrator as

368
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,079
well

369
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,279
we've seen many cases where compromises

370
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:33,600
have

371
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
actually moved into other organizations

372
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,639
via these trust models

373
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,560
we also want to identify where the

374
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,959
security testing systems are these are

375
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,000
the systems that run

376
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
vulnerability scans and they'll have

377
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,920
applications like nessus

378
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,880
or qualis we want to understand where

379
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
those exist we want to understand what

380
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
accounts have access to those

381
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
and what the schedule looks like for

382
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
security testing on the network

383
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
because some of those tools could be

384
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
used by attackers during the compromise

385
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,199
to baseline the network for their own

386
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,800
needs

387
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,320
and then finally to normalize to truly

388
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,839
normalize

389
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,760
our data or our information about the

390
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,279
network we want to understand what the

391
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,880
critical systems are

392
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,800
the critical systems are those servers

393
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,920
or data handling services

394
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
that hold the cr critical information to

395
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
our operations

396
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,279
so the data that is most important to

397
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,560
ensuring we can

398
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,639
conduct our business and meet our

399
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,360
obligations as a business

400
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,720
those are the ones that we want to

401
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
identify we want to know what they do

402
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,680
what data they have where they sit

403
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,560
on the network and who's allowed to

404
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
access those

405
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,600
so let's talk about three rules for

406
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
successful incident response so first

407
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
let's look at data from lots of

408
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,399
standardized computers

409
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,560
if we take all of the systems on the

410
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
network workstations and servers and we

411
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
collect

412
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
a whole bunch of information from each

413
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,959
of those

414
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,800
and we put those all together into a

415
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
database

416
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
then we have the ability to find out

417
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
which pieces of malware

418
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,920
or which actions on these systems are

419
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
most unique across the entire

420
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,800
environment

421
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,079
right and this is most useful when we

422
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,000
have already normalized

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the network we already know what looks

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
normal because we've already defined

425
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,639
that

426
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
and put things in place to try and

427
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,880
contain that

428
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
the second one is a little bit more

429
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,199
difficult we haven't normalized the

430
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,160
network

431
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,480
in number two but we still collect data

432
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,959
from large numbers of computers so

433
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
we get as much data from as many systems

434
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
on the network as we can

435
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,440
it's a little bit more difficult to

436
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
define

437
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
what's unique to find those interesting

438
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
services or the interesting binaries on

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
the network

440
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,920
but it can still be done

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
lastly if we were to gather data from a

442
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
single computer

443
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,959
one at a time it is much more difficult

444
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,919
to determine

445
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,319
what's unique across the environment

446
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
because we're only looking at data from

447
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,760
a single system

448
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,039
right and so this comes back down to

449
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,079
that traditional dfir

450
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,400
that um digital forensics instant

451
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,119
response

452
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,919
the long process where we're creating

453
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,039
disk images

454
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,799
from a bunch of systems and we're

455
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
looking at those one at a time

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
and that's actually the most difficult

457
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,880
way

458
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
to identify what's unique on the network

459
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,280
and really identify those indicators of

460
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
compromise that we're interested in

461
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
so we do all this so that we can hunt

462
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,480
what is unique

463
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,160
we want to look for unusual login

464
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,960
locations unusual login times

465
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
unusual binaries or data files or

466
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
services

467
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
scheduled tasks things like that

468
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,200
we want to look for administrative tools

469
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
that may be used elsewhere on the

470
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
network but exist

471
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
in unique locations for example we've

472
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,840
seen

473
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,600
c colon perflogs be used repeatedly by

474
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
attacks because it's accessible

475
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
and they'll copy the tools that they

476
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,280
need into that directory

477
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,840
and run them from that location because

478
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,880
there are fewer

479
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
restrictions on accounts that can run

480
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,080
from there

481
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
we want to look for unrecognized user

482
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,679
accounts this is

483
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,320
this refers to both normal users as well

484
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
as administrative users we want to

485
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,039
understand if anything has been created

486
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,520
and we want to use the security tools

487
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
that are already available for you

488
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,280
if you've taken your time before a

489
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
compromise to ensure you have

490
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,640
the proper edrs the proper auditing

491
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,600
the proper monitoring in place then we

492
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
should be able to locate these things

493
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,120
that are

494
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,120
your most unique in the environment

495
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
so let's talk a little bit about

496
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,559
persistence

497
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,960
persistence means that an attacker that

498
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
gets into a network has the ability to

499
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,679
come

500
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,679
back into that network whenever they

501
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,000
want and that means they have to create

502
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
a process

503
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
that can survive when a

504
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
system is rebooted or when it is

505
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,280
restarted

506
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
right and so this is typically a

507
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
scheduled task or a service

508
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,080
or registry key or something along those

509
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
lines and that applies to both windows

510
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,360
and to linux and bsd style systems

511
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,039
right um it may also refer to a reverse

512
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,679
tunnel

513
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,039
so when a server is compromised an

514
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,160
attacker can

515
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
set up a means for the server to call

516
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,200
back

517
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
out to a specific c2 channel

518
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
and make that reverse tunnel for the

519
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,120
attackers and we see this quite a bit as

520
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
we do the incident response

521
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
the methods of persistence this is the

522
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,799
identifier this is how we define this

523
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
those persistent mechanisms must restart

524
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
when the system restarts otherwise they

525
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
don't do the attackers any good

526
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,440
and but this allows us a starting point

527
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
for what to look

528
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
for when we do the investigation so

529
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,039
we'll start by looking at

530
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,039
the startup scripts or the scheduled

531
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,679
tasks the cron jobs the services

532
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,280
the kernel modules all those things that

533
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
get loaded every time a system starts

534
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,840
over

535
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,600
so let's talk a little bit about

536
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,480
attacker tools attackers tend not to put

537
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,360
their tools on

538
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,400
every single system so when an

539
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,880
attacker gets into a network they want

540
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
to limit the number of places they put

541
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
the tools

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,120
because the more places we put malware

543
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,080
or tools the better chance we have of

544
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,960
getting detected or getting caught

545
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,200
so we want to limit our exposure as the

546
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
attacker to

547
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,919
being detected we use the same

548
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,880
directories

549
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,440
across systems now this isn't a across

550
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
compromises this is within the context

551
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
of a single compromise

552
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,080
attackers will put their tools in the

553
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
same directories

554
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,280
on the systems within a single

555
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
organization so if i compromise

556
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,640
four servers i will tend to put all of

557
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
my tools in the same directories

558
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,039
on those four servers that makes it

559
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,039
easier to keep up with

560
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,159
and that's also a location that we know

561
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,640
those tools will work

562
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
tools can be commodity which we define

563
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
as things that you can just download off

564
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,600
the internet

565
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
a tool that somebody else has written

566
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
and this could be mimikatz

567
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
metasploit um empire

568
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
powershell things like that but there

569
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
are also targeted

570
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
tools things that were written

571
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
specifically to target your organization

572
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,039
and allow attackers to work within your

573
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,240
environment

574
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,919
and then finally we have the living off

575
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,240
the land binaries or the low bins which

576
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,080
are just common tools such as cis

577
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,039
internals

578
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
the big exception to all this is

579
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
ransomware and there's a large quantity

580
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
of systems

581
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
that are infected with ransomware via

582
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
scheduled task and these can be manually

583
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,919
triggered

584
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,280
or these can be triggered

585
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,000
via long-term scheduled tests services

586
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
so security tools we'll touch on this

587
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
briefly things that will help you

588
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
um antivirus as long as the antivirus

589
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,320
signatures are up to date

590
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,640
you have the ability to detect on things

591
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
that are already known

592
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
but antivirus and our next category

593
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,120
endpoint detection

594
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,880
the edr applications um can be disabled

595
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,480
by attackers with the appropriate

596
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,840
privileges

597
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
edr applications really give you

598
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,559
insight into what's happening on a

599
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,039
single host and once you consolidate all

600
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,960
those into a single dashboard

601
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,240
you can get an idea of what's happening

602
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
across the network at any one point in

603
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,919
time

604
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,919
again what if the malware is unknown

605
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
what if this is targeted directly to

606
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
your organization

607
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,120
this is important to note because this

608
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,400
goes back to

609
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
identifying those services or binaries

610
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,400
that are truly unique within your

611
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,280
environment

612
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
if we want to find malware that was

613
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,960
written specifically for your

614
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,080
organization

615
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,559
we have to step back and look for those

616
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,360
things

617
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
that are truly unique across your

618
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
network

619
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,559
hunting persistence we touched on this a

620
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,600
little bit

621
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
a few minutes ago the services the

622
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,720
scheduled tasks the kernel modules the

623
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
cron jobs things like that

624
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
those are what we're looking for we want

625
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
to understand how the attackers

626
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,760
continue to get back into the network

627
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,200
in the end something somewhere on some

628
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
server

629
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
is allowing the attacker to get back

630
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,799
it's either a service that's listening

631
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,000
for a connection

632
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,679
or it's making that reverse tunnel

633
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,679
request back out to the internet to a

634
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,960
known c2 channel

635
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
to receive commands from an attacker

636
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,279
so if you normalize your data if you

637
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,640
normalize your network

638
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,880
if you understand what the configuration

639
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
looks like across your

640
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
entire organization then when a

641
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,840
compromise

642
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,159
is detected it's going to be that much

643
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,120
easier

644
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,720
for you to react and to be successful

645
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,760
as you do your investigations and the

646
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,880
goal here

647
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,480
is not to ensure that you never get

648
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,679
compromised again

649
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,799
right because attackers are constantly

650
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,840
evolving and escalating the way they do

651
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,799
their work

652
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,640
what we want to do is detect these

653
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,559
compromises more quickly

654
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,360
in time and we want to limit the

655
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,960
exposure or the impact of a compromise

656
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
and we want to understand what accounts

657
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
and systems were compromised

658
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,880
and what those c2 channels were more

659
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,840
quickly

660
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,400
if you don't normalize it's going to be

661
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,360
very difficult

662
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
to find those attackers to find what's

663
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
interesting to find what's unique on the

664
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,679
network

665
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,919
and so it's very important to address

666
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,279
that in the beginning

667
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,000
and try and get that taken care of so

668
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
you're better

669
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
able to respond when an incident does

670
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,039
happen on your network

671
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,440
um thank you i appreciate being here

672
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,159
today

673
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,000
again my name is russ rogers i'm from

674
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
microsoft and i'm looking forward to

675
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
your questions

676
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
hey everyone uh so we had some audio

677
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,919
issues on the main channel

678
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
uh so we're going to be uploading the

679
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
video up to

680
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,000
event hub as soon as possible uh but for

681
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
right now if you had any questions

682
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,559
uh for what audio you did catch uh we

683
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,600
will have x

684
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,080
asked ask the speaker session right

685
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,799
after this

686
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
uh so you can ask the speaker a question

687
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,919
directly uh

688
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,600
