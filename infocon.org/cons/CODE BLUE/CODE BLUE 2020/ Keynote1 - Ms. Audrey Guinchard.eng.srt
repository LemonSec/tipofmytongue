1
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,520
good afternoon

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,239
i'm rodrigo senior lecturer at the

3
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,360
university of

4
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,559
essex and the united kingdom

5
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,800
england uh i'm here for

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
uh this conference go blue so thank you

7
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
cod blue for

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
uh allowing me to do this presentation

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
and especially as a keynote speaker by

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,479
the time you'll see

11
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,680
uh my this video um it will be three

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
o'clock in the morning for me

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,520
and stop re-recording now my

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,880
presentation

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,159
is on rethinking and i'm going to show

16
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
my screen

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,159
rethinking cybercrime legislation

18
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
to support vulnerability research so

19
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,040
security research

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
and my starting point is the uk but i'd

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,119
like to also to bring

22
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,640
uh two international legal

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
instruments so my focus is

24
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,320
really the legal point of view it's not

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
centered on computer science

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
my own background is that of a law

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
academic i specialize in criminal law i

28
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,479
also do now

29
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
data protection and i also do

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
three jurisdiction i'm familiar with the

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
uk and france

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,239
a bit less the us but still now this

33
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,440
research

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,879
is legal but it doesn't ignore computer

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,000
science

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,480
on the country i have incorporated

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
computer science research on

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
vulnerability research and markets

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
i had conversations with the security

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
industry

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
especially in the uk where the

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
part of that industry is pushing for

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
reform

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,200
alongside the network called the

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
criminal law reform network

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
that has looked at the computer media's

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,280
act and

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
has released a report freely accessible

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
the details are at the end of this

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
presentation

51
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,879
so on on the legal side the aspect of

52
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
the law that

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
is to bear in mind is that it is

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
jurisdictional

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
it's geographically based but in cyber

56
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
crime it's not because you're in

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
one country that you are protected from

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,800
uh the other country your neighbors or

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
countries that are a couple of thousand

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,319
miles away

61
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,319
and from those countries claiming

62
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
jurisdiction and claiming

63
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
that they can bring you to justice so

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
really um my point was

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
being in one jurisdiction doesn't

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
protect um

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
as such now that said i'm going to look

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
really at the uk

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,120
and internationally go on instruments

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
these two international good instruments

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
that i want to look at

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,239
are the directive um by the

73
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,440
european union which the uk is getting

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,000
out

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,799
i hope you didn't have as many news

76
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,239
information on brexit than we have here

77
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,239
uh you just been spared that but you

78
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,040
also have the convention on cybercrime

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,720
number 185 by the console of europe

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
the way to distinguish the european

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
union from the console of europe is

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
simply to think about it as a map

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
as you can see here european union

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
will have 27 member states by 31st of

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,839
december council of europe will keep the

86
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,560
uk

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
and has currently 48 countries

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
my assumption is this work um i

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
consider that and i don't think that's a

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
revelation really

91
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
that the vulnerabilities exist they need

92
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,320
to be found

93
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,639
they need to be patched that is an

94
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
essential contribution to the fight

95
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
against cybercrime

96
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,000
so we need security researchers

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
um the work is not necessarily

98
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
approved by vendors and system owners

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,560
people

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
are not necessarily employed by a

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
contract

102
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
the work is in usually in good faith

103
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
it's often span across different

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,400
jurisdictions

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
it's linked with vulnerability markets

106
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,360
that are perfectly legitimate

107
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
um and it also involves academic

108
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
researchers

109
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
who do vulnerability research so what is

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
the key argument here my key argument is

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
that

112
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
in an effort to catch cyber criminals

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
cyborg crime legislation have tended to

114
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,680
be very broad and effectively too broad

115
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,479
and being so broad what they did is that

116
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:32,960
they

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
created at best grey areas

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
and therefore legal uncertainty about

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
whether security research

120
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,720
is legitimate or not depending on the

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
conducts the behaviors

122
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
uh and at worst they simply criminalize

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
something that may be completely

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
ethically correct and following

125
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,280
ethical requirements but in law it would

126
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
not be

127
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
now i'm here talking about the three

128
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
stages of venerability research

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
discovery proof of concept i'm not

130
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
talking about exploits

131
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
and uh disclosure it's not a theoretical

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
problem uh you have multiple reports

133
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,199
over the years

134
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,080
on the investigation prosecution and

135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,639
that time convictions convictions may be

136
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,360
rare

137
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
but they exist and more importantly you

138
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
don't really want to go through

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
prosecution

140
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
having to pay huge amount of lawyers

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
fees to get out of the hook

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
it's a problem in many countries japan

143
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,600
us

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,639
france uk australia latin america it's

145
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,080
such a problem that

146
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
the electronic frontier foundation

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
created the codeus right project to

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,319
protect security researchers in 2018

149
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
internet known foundation also mentioned

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
it in 2020

151
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
a couple of months ago the european

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,160
cyber

153
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
security agency and issa also had

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
drafted two reports published two

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
reports

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
on the problem so what are the the key

157
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,400
elements

158
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
i'm going to go through in this

159
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,240
presentation

160
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
uh the problematic points are access

161
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,160
authorization

162
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
intent and tools there are certain

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,919
protective measures that can be taken

164
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
but not all of them will be

165
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
enough actually most of them are not

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,880
going to be enough

167
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,039
unless we go for public interest defense

168
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,440
and that is the key argument that i'm

169
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,479
looking at

170
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,759
the key solution how can we incorporate

171
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,720
a public interest defense

172
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,240
and my conclusion so the type of cyber

173
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
crime offenses

174
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,919
you have roughly three whichever legal

175
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
instrument you look at the uk

176
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
the directive and the convention and

177
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
other countries

178
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
and authorized access are usually

179
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,039
nickname hacking

180
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,879
but it is this you have

181
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,080
unauthorized damage and interference

182
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,080
misuse of tool as the three key offenses

183
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,039
the uh summary of those offenses are

184
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,599
here

185
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
so you can have a look later on on this

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
and i would like to go through key key

187
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,319
points

188
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
um authorization what is it access

189
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
intent and tools in the knowledge that

190
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,199
you have no immunity from persecution

191
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
if there is no prosecution it's simply

192
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
because the prosecutor has refused to do

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
so

194
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,240
so key point of access

195
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
now in the uk it's a complete misnomer

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
the offense exists even if you never

197
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,279
ever obtain

198
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
access okay so there's no need of a

199
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
result which is access

200
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
it just need other conduct and that

201
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,000
conduct is defined

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
very very broadly because there's a

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
computer to perform

204
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
any function with intent secure access

205
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,519
or to enable somebody else to secure

206
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
access so your colleague at work

207
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
could be part of that now access is

208
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,120
defined

209
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
in the computer misuse act cma's

210
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
computer museus act

211
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,959
section 17 it's altering or erasing

212
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
program or data

213
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,360
copying using it printing because it was

214
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,320
1990 so we still have printers

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
um but effectively it's any conduct

216
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
and you can see it plus you have

217
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
attacked

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
so you can see it as that effectively

219
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,720
anything in the uk any conduct

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
any behavior is a crime if you fit the

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
other elements

222
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
except the fault thought has not yet

223
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
been criminalized

224
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
but switching on a computer is

225
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,440
considered as fitting the definition

226
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
of access clicking on the link is

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
definitely been confirmed

228
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
as uh being unauthorized access in the

229
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
ellis case

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
same thing as pre-logging access on

231
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
somebody who didn't log out

232
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
even though it was in that case to look

233
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
at the legitimate newspaper

234
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,000
website available free of charge anyway

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
poor scanning depending of what you do

236
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
can be a great it's certainly a gray

237
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,360
area

238
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
and at worst it can become a danger zone

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,399
that you definitely want to avoid

240
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,680
um you have uh connecting

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,959
a website to observe traffic directory

242
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,360
traversal test can be a crime that was

243
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,839
the case in 2005 in the uk

244
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,920
um a lot of probing can be

245
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,959
a crime and of course access come from

246
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
looking at analyzing compromised systems

247
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,399
can be

248
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
unauthorized access so

249
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
effectively to summarize this i put it

250
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
in this form

251
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,560
in yellow at the bottom here you can see

252
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
the computer museus act of the uk so

253
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,680
roughly

254
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
anything after the fort is criminalized

255
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
you can see that the convention in the

256
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,680
directive comes in

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,959
much later when you are far closer to

258
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,160
having obtained access another way of

259
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
putting exactly the same information

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,560
is to look at a pyramid

261
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
you can see the uk is at the bottom too

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,959
so very much um

263
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,399
abroad offense much more restricted

264
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
in other countries and definitely in the

265
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,760
convention and the directive

266
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
now is the uk is definitely an outlier

267
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
but is the uk the only country

268
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,040
problematic uh no most eu and non-eu

269
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,279
states have criminalized at times which

270
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,760
means that you definitely

271
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
don't need to reach the level of access

272
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,279
to have gained

273
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,480
access to uh have committing a conduct

274
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,200
that can be criminalized

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,320
the additional element is that nobody

276
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
defines the attempt

277
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
uh in the same way in addition to the

278
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
fact that nobody defines and authorize

279
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,000
access in the same way

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
so you've got a huge legal uncertainty

281
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,519
because what may be

282
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,760
legal in one country will not be in the

283
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,639
next one

284
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
or in another one legal uncertainty

285
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,440
um is definitely uh for scanning ports

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
in some countries it's considered as

287
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
appropriate to react where you won't

288
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,680
have

289
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
liability it can be an attempt it will

290
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,360
be liable

291
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
or full access same thing for connecting

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
a company website

293
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
just to observe the the others trying to

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
gain access just that

295
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
is preparatory with no liability in

296
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,399
france

297
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
attempting netherlands and definitely

298
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
the complete offense in the uk

299
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
so that's for access and i'd like to

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,279
move to authorization

301
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,360
authorization is defined as

302
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
somebody who so lack of authorization is

303
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
defined as

304
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,279
somebody was not himself

305
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
a responsibility for access and

306
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
authorizing that access

307
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
or we didn't have the consent of the

308
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,279
person or company

309
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,959
so effectively anybody who is not

310
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
officially employed

311
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,399
and contracted by a com a company

312
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
and is looking at that network or

313
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
website will have no consent no

314
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,399
authority

315
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,600
uh and even if you're contracted and

316
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,160
employed you may still fall full of the

317
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,519
law and

318
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
fit that definition of lack of

319
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
authorization

320
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,519
now in the directive you have that

321
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
definition

322
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
it's called without right same wording

323
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,839
in the convention it's called without

324
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,320
right

325
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,720
and um it is definitely they are

326
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,760
thinking about

327
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
the directive thought about security

328
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,279
research

329
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,199
but they only mention it when they are

330
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,800
contracted by vendors

331
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
so effectively it's pointless because

332
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
the main problem exists when the

333
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,320
security researcher is not mandated

334
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
by the system owner to look at the

335
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
system

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
or the network the convention didn't

337
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
really think i i i would think of

338
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
independent researchers because they

339
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,360
were not really

340
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
the norm um

341
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,639
so vulnerability markets appeared in

342
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,120
2005

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
five six years after the convention was

344
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
drafted

345
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
now you'll think well i don't see where

346
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
it's the problem for authorization i've

347
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,120
got a vulnerability disclosure policy

348
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
it's about bounty programs everything is

349
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
official it's on websites vulnerability

350
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,120
markets

351
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
well the main issue is that policies are

352
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,920
vague even the good drafted one can be

353
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
vague

354
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,680
vendors can refuse authorization

355
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
afterwards so

356
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,760
a veneer ability disclosure policy may

357
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,800
not protect you

358
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,760
enough from vendors saying i know that's

359
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,120
not in my policy

360
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,839
and i don't consider this as authorized

361
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,199
and you may find that it's very

362
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,320
difficult to argue the opposite

363
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
and that was found in the case of mengam

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,839
even though mankind

365
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,079
was had problematic behavior

366
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,800
you also have uh and that's called

367
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
liability dumping

368
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,720
by any in its reports

369
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
and the last point that often security

370
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,399
researchers says well

371
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,199
i don't have intent to obtain access i

372
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:35,600
don't

373
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,680
i just don't want to fix vulnerabilities

374
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,480
i'm not there to create mayhem

375
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
but the law doesn't care about whether a

376
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,040
person wants to save the world or cause

377
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
an argument

378
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
intent is just aim and purpose to obtain

379
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,399
access and the knowledge is not

380
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,600
authorized

381
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
if you fit the fact of having access

382
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
not authorized and your main purpose to

383
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,720
do so

384
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
whether you do it for good reason or bad

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
reason it doesn't matter

386
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,000
the tant is not motives and

387
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,759
you have a case in the uk that

388
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,279
definitely looked at this

389
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,560
uh cube of case 2005

390
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,600
where the church regretted and wrote you

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
regretted to be able

392
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,160
to have to found khufuf

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
guilty of unauthorized access uh in the

394
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,399
knowledge

395
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,600
that our security researcher was

396
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
funding uh members of or swap so it was

397
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,600
not anybody

398
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,399
and the judge had to say so because the

399
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,880
judge especially said it's not a motive

400
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,680
to want to check if it's a scam

401
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
you committed unauthorized access misuse

402
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
of tool is also a problem especially in

403
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,160
the uk

404
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
because there's no restrictions so even

405
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
tour and vpn uh

406
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
will be an offense if you obtain

407
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
authorized access so you're

408
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,279
in that and even supplying and offering

409
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,079
to supply

410
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,959
two can be a problem as long as you have

411
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
to believe that the criminals will use

412
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,519
it

413
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,760
and we know full well that do you do all

414
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
use hacking tools

415
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,520
well the chances are good that kernels

416
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,199
will use it so you'll have to believe

417
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,679
that

418
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,799
cranial will use it

419
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,000
in international legal instrument for

420
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
the misuse of tune

421
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
article 7 of the directive has a

422
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
cautious approach so it's definitely

423
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,439
trying to protect security researchers

424
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,360
article 6 of the convention on

425
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,480
cybercrime is the only one that actually

426
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,360
protects

427
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
express elite security researchers okay

428
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
and it was drafted because the security

429
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,400
industry lobbied

430
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
the council of europe quite effectively

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
uh problem well the first thing is

432
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,440
national

433
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
um legislation never uh

434
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
created the equivalent of article 62.

435
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,000
only france did um there is no

436
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
other protection offered for the overall

437
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
fences it only works for

438
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,240
mizusoftu doesn't work for an authorized

439
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
access

440
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,559
could we use this uh close to say look

441
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,760
national enterprise

442
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
legislation needs to be interpreted in

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,360
light of

444
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,720
well we can't extend national

445
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
legislation by analogy so that is

446
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,120
really not possible so i summarized here

447
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,799
the problem for discovery

448
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,600
verification and disclosure discoveries

449
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
that requires access verification is

450
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
probably misuse of tool

451
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,679
tool being the proof of concept and

452
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,960
disclosure

453
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
linked with encouraging an access or

454
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
your liability

455
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,679
so the solutions what can we do about

456
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,880
this

457
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,200
the first steps that some countries have

458
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,679
already taken is to have prosecutorial

459
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,559
guidelines

460
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,400
and or memorandum of understanding

461
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,360
good steps i cannot deny that they are

462
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,240
very useful

463
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,600
they set a number of boundaries and

464
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,640
expectations

465
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
uh netherlands did it but some

466
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,600
countries like germany don't have

467
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,720
prosecutorial discretion so

468
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
once something comes to uh knowledge

469
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,120
uh they cannot refuse to persecute

470
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
uh more importantly security researchers

471
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
depend on goodwill and good

472
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
understanding of the prosecution's

473
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,440
authorities which is not with the case

474
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,240
and once the prosecution has been has

475
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,039
started

476
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,400
there is zero protection available

477
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,799
so the court will probably find them

478
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,919
guilty because

479
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,400
motive is not part of intent and they

480
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
will probably find that there is lack of

481
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
authorization

482
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,640
so effectively it's good to stop the

483
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,280
flow

484
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
of um going to court

485
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
but it's not a full proof it's not a

486
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,280
hundred percent guarantee

487
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,600
um the restriction of the scope of

488
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,440
offenses restricting the scope of

489
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
offenses well definitely for the uk

490
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,760
but for many countries it's not going to

491
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
work because otherwise

492
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,559
too many cyber criminals will

493
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,760
get away with it so effectively

494
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,080
we we're stuck with the fact we can't

495
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,400
really change the offences the uk

496
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
a little bit but many of uh national

497
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
legislation will be

498
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
certainly not the convention and not the

499
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,919
directive

500
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
and we have issues with uh

501
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,679
once in court security researchers can't

502
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,520
do anything

503
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,200
so that's where the public interest

504
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,080
defense come in and that's really really

505
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,120
key to think about it difference in

506
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,039
criminal law means that you

507
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,960
take into account motives you're saying

508
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,679
yes you've committed this offense and

509
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,320
there is

510
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
enough certainty to say that you

511
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,039
committed this offence but you've got

512
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,480
good reasons to do so i acknowledge that

513
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,960
you are

514
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,760
justified in doing so and therefore i'm

515
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,039
going to say that you're not guilty

516
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,919
we all heard about self-defense

517
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,880
necessity

518
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,520
self-defense when we attacked we can

519
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
attack back

520
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,159
now how is that incorporated you've got

521
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
the concept in legal terms of necessity

522
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,720
motives are taken into account for

523
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,159
necessity

524
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,440
i don't think that would be very

525
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
difficult for which to met security

526
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
researchers to say that

527
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,520
the access or the attempt to access

528
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,840
was necessary for the purpose of finding

529
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,039
the vulnerability and fixing it

530
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,400
now the key point is proportionality

531
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,039
where the steps taken reasonable

532
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,159
proportionate

533
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,360
to the aim and it's not about the best

534
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
techniques it's about

535
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
good practice looking at ethical

536
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
requirements

537
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
fitting within those ethical

538
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,600
requirements

539
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
and the practice in the industry

540
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,440
and awareness of risk so a public

541
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
interest

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,559
defense will not protect from

543
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,840
prosecution

544
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
so much then it will protect from the

545
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,039
fact that

546
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,520
a security researcher can argue that in

547
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,480
court

548
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,480
and can effectively avoid conviction

549
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,240
now is that a novelty no

550
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
defenses are very classic tools in

551
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
criminal law

552
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,960
and in the uk it already exists

553
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
except it doesn't exist for security

554
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,039
research in cyber crime

555
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,520
it exists for cyber to security research

556
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
in relation to data protection laws

557
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
there is a defense in the data

558
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,520
protection act in the uk 2018

559
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
it has necessity reasonable belief that

560
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
the testing was justified for

561
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,360
being in the public interest the testing

562
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,000
to find

563
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,360
a weakness in the software and it

564
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
has to be proportionate including

565
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,360
disclosure so that notion of responsible

566
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,480
disclosure

567
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,120
is integrated into the legislation so

568
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
it's not impossible

569
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
and i argue that we could do the same

570
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,720
and we should do

571
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,679
the same with cyber crime legislation

572
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,000
it's time to make cyber crime laws fit

573
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,720
for the 21st century

574
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
the slogan is not mine

575
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
disclaimer it is the ncc group

576
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
if you go on their website you'll see

577
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,919
that um it's but it's the main idea

578
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
that uh it's 30 years on since the uk

579
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,679
started its legislation 20 since the

580
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,360
convention

581
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,159
more recent for the directive we need to

582
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,880
think about

583
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,000
cyber security researchers and that will

584
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,279
have also an impact

585
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,279
on journalists and whistleblowers

586
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,440
because so far when you look data

587
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,279
as a whistleblower you're committing an

588
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
otherwise access

589
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,080
thank you for having listened to me uh

590
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
thank you for code blue for this

591
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,679
invitation

592
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,640
um of presenting i'm absolutely

593
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,919
delighted to

594
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,880
be part of this conference and i will be

595
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
answering questions

596
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,400
thank you
