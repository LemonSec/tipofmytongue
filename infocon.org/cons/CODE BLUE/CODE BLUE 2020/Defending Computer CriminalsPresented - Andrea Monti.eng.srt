1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,040
today's agenda

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,440
is designed to provide a logical path

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,680
that start from theory to end with

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,480
practical

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,679
advice for an effective defense the talk

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,200
is divided in three part a

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
criminological profile taxonomy of the

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,239
defendants

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,760
the analysis of the digital

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,359
investigation carried on by the

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
prosecution to build the case

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439
and the trial strategies of the defense

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
council

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,720
this talk is a primer for those defense

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
counsel who have no experience in the

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
specific field of criminal trials

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
involving computer

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,800
digital assets and the internet i do

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,399
apologize in advance

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,840
to those colleagues who are more

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
experienced in these matters

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,920
for having simplified too much or not

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
mentioned many issues

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,760
the model of computer crime defense is

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
vast and deep as the ocean

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
and there is no time to explore it

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,640
completely

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
from another perspective the talk

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
provides insights to computer experts

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
wanting to enter into the digital

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,399
forensic sector

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,480
because it offers a way to understand

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
how a lawyer thinks

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
and what are his needs when designing a

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,240
defense strategy

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
the focus is on the practical issues as

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,000
emerged from the direct

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
trial experience therefore the legal

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
theory and the ict technical aspects are

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
not discussed in detail

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
both the legal and the iit professional

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
though can find in the discussion

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,400
enough hints to widen their

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
understanding of the matter

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,320
and improve the effectiveness of their

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
strategies

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,920
computer-related trial advocacy is a

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,280
matter in itself

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
and computer crime and focus is a very

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
special subcategory

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,360
a sun criminal litigation experience is

52
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
of course useful

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,040
but cannot be translated as such in the

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
realm of digital crime

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,840
as said the topic is vast and will

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
require a three ties to be thoroughly

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,200
analyzed a dramatically important thing

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
to consider when dealing with such kind

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,360
of cases is procedural defense

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
the defense based upon legal

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,439
technicalities somebody would call it

62
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,600
hair splitting involving the way

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,680
investigation has been performed

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
the role of computer forensic standards

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
the way international investigation have

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
been carried out

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
different jurisdiction though give

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,800
different relevance to such kind of

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,599
issue

70
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,120
and it's necessary to necessary to take

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,160
into account

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
that calls often follow the prosecution

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,599
therefore

74
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
building a defense only upon procedural

75
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
ground may be risky

76
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
this is by no means a definitive or

77
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
success and description of what happens

78
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
when somebody is targeted by a computer

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,840
criminal

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
nonetheless there are various reactions

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,879
triggered

82
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,200
by the discover of having been victim of

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
a criminal offense

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
in particular the victim if the victim

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
has no technical expertise the very

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
first phase is the most confusing

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
and useful for the defense making sense

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
about what happened

89
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
takes time and especially in various

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
related or fishing cases

91
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,680
follows the attacker because it gives

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
him the the time to disappear and to

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
cashing the outcome of his felony

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
in this phase the victim is likely to

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
ask for technical support to somebody

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
who might be well versed in computer

97
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
programming or system

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
administration but one with no forensic

99
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,440
skill

100
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
this is something that might prove to be

101
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
very useful in the trial phase

102
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
as for what happens when law enforcement

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
enter the game this is a moment where

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
mistakes occur once involved the

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
prosecutor starts a multi-trading

106
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,920
investigation

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
depending by the early existence of not

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
of a suspect the prosecutor will have

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,879
strop email

110
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,920
and calls searches the suspect premises

111
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
collect from the crime scene

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
all the information available and if the

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
crimes involve the internet

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
we query isp and internet governance

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,959
entities

116
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
this is a crucial part of the

117
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
investigation

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
the use of computer and

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
telecommunication networks for

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
criminal purposes has increased thanks

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
to the spread of knowledge of methods

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,920
and techniques

123
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
outside the original hacker environment

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,040
and thanks to the lack of attention that

125
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
icd companies have paid for a long time

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
to computer security

127
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
action that in the early 90s required

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,839
highly skilled computer experts

129
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
are now available as software tools or

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
even in

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
as a service business model although

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,560
there are

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
always been illegal there have been

134
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,000
always been

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,280
uh illegal uses from information

136
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
technology

137
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
the first phenomena of unauthorized

138
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
attacks on computers and software

139
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
are manifested in the usa in university

140
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,919
as a form of protest against the

141
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,000
limitation of access to computer centers

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,120
and software

143
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
the us played the central role in

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
shaping the hacker culture that grew up

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
as an articulated and not necessarily

146
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
current ecosystem

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,960
reading its fundamental tax similar but

148
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,280
not

149
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,440
entirely overlapping ideological

150
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,199
positions emerge

151
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
the group manifesto at the base of the

152
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,479
free software movement

153
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,400
supports a political vision aimed at

154
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,680
eliminating the proper

155
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
approach to software the consensus of an

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,720
eye care

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
terrorizes the hacker anarchic right to

158
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,479
access any system in the name of

159
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,280
knowledge

160
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,000
and despite any law and the declaration

161
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
of the independence of cyberspace

162
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
is a program for the creation of a new

163
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
social contract based

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
on unknown place the cyberped space

165
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
at the same time ambiguous figures like

166
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,120
kevin miknick

167
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
on one hand embody the ideal of the

168
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,919
anti-system hacker

169
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
but on the other hand propose a socially

170
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,680
immoral model

171
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
according to which if something is

172
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
possible then it can be done

173
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
no matter what in europe the hacker

174
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,280
culture develops

175
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,759
particular traits when strength comes

176
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,800
from video games

177
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
grows around the concept of just for fun

178
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
and only later evolves toward a vision

179
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
similar to that of the mentor at the

180
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
same time

181
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
from dystopian for the from the

182
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,919
dystopian

183
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,479
ideology of cyberpunk groups are born

184
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
that use hacker knowledge for

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
political goals and are the present

186
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
predecessor of

187
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
modern activists

188
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
understanding the profile of the client

189
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
either a suspect or

190
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
or a defendant is crucial it is useless

191
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
and inefficient to defend the political

192
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,800
activist

193
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
using a strategy designed for a commerce

194
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
for for a

195
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
common criminal sorry in the same way

196
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
the council will certainly air in his

197
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
assessment if he treats a lamer

198
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
as if he were dealing with a real expert

199
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
the criminological and psychological

200
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
profile of the client also played a

201
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
fundamental role

202
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
role in the interaction between him and

203
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,520
the police forces

204
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
a hacktivist once identified could

205
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
publicly

206
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
claim the action valuing the media

207
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
exposure more than a trial strategy

208
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
based on silence and tactical action

209
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
a subject who lives in a state of

210
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
isolation from society

211
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,039
or who ask who has committed a crime

212
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,440
without belonging to uh to a criminal

213
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,319
underground

214
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
could immediately collapse at the merc

215
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
site of universe

216
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
and confess everything on the spot in

217
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
some jurisdiction the statements of the

218
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,840
sub

219
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
the suspect released without his lawyer

220
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,440
are not valid in a trial

221
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
this bando does not apply during the

222
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
investigation therefore the prosecutor

223
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
will nonetheless take advantage of the

224
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,039
information that he has managed to

225
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,240
collect

226
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
this graph is as impressive synthetic

227
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
but precise description of how the

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,080
ecosystem of a digital underground is

229
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,960
composed

230
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
and where the hacker world intersects

231
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,440
with the world of crime and intelligence

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
it is useful because it allows the

233
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
lawyer to position their cast

234
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,280
the charged people in a reasonable

235
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
precise location and facilitates the

236
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
work of setting up

237
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
the defense consisting with the

238
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,000
defendant criminological profile

239
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
one thing to summarize therefore one can

240
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
say that a hacker is not necessarily

241
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,199
criminal

242
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,720
and the criminal it knows not

243
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,680
necessarily a hacker

244
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,599
it is important to warn the council

245
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,520
wanting to try a computer crime case

246
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
that in addition to his traditional

247
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,479
counterparts

248
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
law enforcement and public prosecutors

249
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
and sometimes

250
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
judge his client and his expert witness

251
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
are the main thread

252
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
to recon wheat the former in the case of

253
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
a skilled person

254
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
may be prone to challenge his own

255
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
defense counsel if he feels that

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,039
inability

257
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,440
of to grasp the technical complexity of

258
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
the investigation

259
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
the latter in particular if lacking of

260
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,479
academic credential

261
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,720
may try to bring in his personal views

262
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
rather than objective information

263
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,479
losing the focus on what is necessary

264
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,760
for the trial

265
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,519
therefore the ideal council should have

266
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
a solid technological background

267
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
or at least the capability to understand

268
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,880
on its own the general aspect of the

269
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,159
digital environment

270
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
so to properly address and keep it pay

271
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,360
both the client and the expert witness

272
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
the somebody might yet have tampered the

273
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,600
information is an example of invisible

274
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
defense

275
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
claiming that information stored on a

276
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
computer may have been planted because

277
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
of the lack of proper forensic care

278
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,320
in its handling is possible but sound

279
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,760
evidence are needed

280
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
to sustain this approach are just

281
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
invoking a mere possibility is not

282
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
enough

283
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
much too often science fiction fiction

284
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,519
ideas are blindly accepted into a in a

285
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,399
trial

286
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,640
a computer is just a couple of access

287
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
credential that does not not necessarily

288
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
identify as a natural person

289
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
as far as a criminal investigation is

290
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
concerned there is no virtual

291
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,680
or cyberspace artificial intelligence is

292
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
not ghost in the shell

293
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
and there are no autonomous algorithm

294
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
that does things on behalf of human

295
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
by contracts highly automated software

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
can of course perform the material part

297
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,839
of the trial of the crime

298
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,360
but the human being is always behind the

299
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560
screen traditional evidence

300
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
fingerprints tailing people witness

301
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,680
statement

302
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
remains very important a council can

303
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
build a highly complex technical defense

304
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
that can be destroyed by a simple

305
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,600
simple old-school police investigation

306
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
possibly though the bigger mistake is

307
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
lecture in the court

308
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
as said as a rule of thumb colts do not

309
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
like when a lawyer plays smart

310
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
a judge might not be skilled enough in

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
the complexities of computer crimes

312
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
and therefore it might be necessary to

313
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
introduce technical facts in the trial

314
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
but this should be done with a lot of

315
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
care

316
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
a component of the trial strategy is the

317
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,360
exploitation

318
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,399
of the swiss cheese principle

319
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
i think how the digital world works

320
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,079
allows to highlight

321
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,880
missing links in investigations for

322
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,839
example

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
the ip number assigned to the suspect

324
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,839
was communicated to the investigators by

325
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,040
the isp

326
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,839
but they did not verify whether the isp

327
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,920
handed out the correct data

328
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
or the prosecutor sized the computer

329
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
that the

330
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
accused person used to commit the crime

331
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
but no one verified if the computer was

332
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,959
functioning

333
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
at that time or if it could connect to

334
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
the network

335
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
moreover nobody may be they're just

336
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
verified if the charge

337
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
is that of a spread in a virus that the

338
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
infected computers were

339
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,519
actually damaged countless are the

340
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,000
example

341
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
of how the swiss cheese strategy comes

342
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,040
into play

343
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
the defense count's role is to spot the

344
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,720
holes pluck them

345
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
as prosecutor duty mensoria

346
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,279
is often an underestimated defense

347
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
its assessment not only in the computer

348
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
crime trials is very complicated

349
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
action and their consequences are

350
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
measurable but proving the mental

351
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
attitude of the chartered person

352
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
is not always easy or possible and

353
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,040
nevertheless

354
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,279
mansouria is fundamental to establishing

355
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,079
the defendant's

356
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,040
innocence or guilt-ness in other words

357
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,959
is not enough for a provision to state

358
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
that illegal access to an 80 system is a

359
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
criminal offence

360
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,240
but it's also necessary to specify

361
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
whether the crime is committed

362
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,160
because of a voluntary act or also by

363
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
mistake or recklessness

364
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
in case of illegal access to an italian

365
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
bank

366
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
the criminal court of milan in italy

367
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
akita the defendants because they had

368
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
committed the fact

369
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
by believing that the penetration test

370
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
contract between the bank and the

371
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,639
multinational software company

372
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,279
for which they worked was already active

373
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,040
the fact was there but

374
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,319
mensarea was not

375
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,720
there are several checkpoints to

376
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
consider when tuning a defense

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
the victim whether an individual or a

378
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,680
company might

379
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
have compromised the information or

380
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,560
wrongly reported criminal information

381
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,639
the police might just have gun along the

382
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,120
easy way without taking into account the

383
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
whole evidence or by contrast

384
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
try to push a specific theory of the

385
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
case that does not not match with facts

386
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
asian law enforcements sometimes ask

387
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
for an isp or platform for information

388
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
without a warrant

389
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
because there is no time they used to

390
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,720
say this is a wound to the right of

391
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,880
defense as the defendant has no way

392
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,760
to double check if the information given

393
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,519
are correct

394
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
in a recent crackdown on digital pirates

395
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,959
in italy an

396
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,120
innocent u.s website has been blocked

397
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
without the owner being officially

398
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
notified of the facts journal is still

399
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,319
ongoing

400
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,959
as said a judge rarely agrees to be

401
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,440
lectured by a lawyer especially if the

402
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,760
latter is also an academic

403
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
often however computer crime trials

404
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,480
require the council to introduce in the

405
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,880
cross-examination

406
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,279
and in its objection some technical

407
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
aspects that are most likely little

408
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
known to the judge

409
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
and about which perhaps the prosecutor

410
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
will have to dispute

411
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,839
it is essential therefore to find the

412
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,680
right balance between the need to pass

413
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,519
on the information to the court

414
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
and the importance of not highlighting

415
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,199
the judge's lacks

416
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,160
of knowledge or appearing as patronizing

417
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
him

418
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
furthermore the lawyer must have respect

419
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,079
for the intelligence of the court

420
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,000
the lawyer should not deliberately try

421
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
to confuse the judge by exploiting his

422
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
unfamiliarity with information

423
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,959
technology

424
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
to present arguments that are just wild

425
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,600
speculation or to generate confusion

426
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
and latent the duration of the trial the

427
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,839
judge may not be an information

428
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,120
technology expert

429
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,959
but he is perfectly capable of

430
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
understanding when a lawyer is trying to

431
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,079
be smart

432
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,880
it is a suicide strategy that can wholly

433
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
harm the defendant

434
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
and ruin the professional reputation of

435
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,959
his council

436
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,240
the procedural defense was purpose is to

437
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
challenge the evidence gathering process

438
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,480
and

439
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,199
not the results achieved is essential in

440
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,199
a computer crime case

441
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,920
the difficulty to put into practice are

442
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,800
mainly true

443
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,959
the council must be well versed in the

444
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
iit aspects of the investigation

445
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,079
and solely relying upon legalistic

446
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,959
matters

447
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
usually conveys to the judge and to the

448
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,000
prosecutor

449
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
the sense of an indirect admission of

450
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
guilt therefore

451
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,519
the lawyer the lawyer must be cautious

452
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
in using a procedural defense to

453
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
challenge how the prosecutor achieved

454
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
his results

455
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
and their evidentiary value to avoid

456
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
being a cast of wild

457
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
speculation and just deadly affecting

458
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,320
the case

459
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
in particular if there is a jury

460
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
listening

461
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
the deciding to go for a procedural

462
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
defense then suggest to confront

463
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
directly the matter in court

464
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
by making a public statement about in

465
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,440
terms of

466
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,759
the importance of protecting the right

467
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,720
to defense

468
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
the fence for a computer crime trials

469
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
varies greatly depending on when the

470
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,320
lawyer has been

471
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,279
involved in the case if he's called in

472
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
during the investigation he can

473
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
understand more easily the direction

474
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,120
that the prosecutor might take

475
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
if on the other hand the lawyer

476
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
intervenes just before the trial his

477
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
options are more limited

478
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,320
because he can only act based on what

479
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
the prosecution has done

480
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
with a limited possibility of a parallel

481
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
investigation

482
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,240
the choice to set the trial exclusively

483
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,519
on procedural defenses

484
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
uh as we have said as our dos because it

485
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,079
it is seen as an admission of guilt and

486
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,639
therefore

487
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
introduce a negative prejudice in the

488
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
mind of the judge nevertheless

489
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
the procedural defense matters because

490
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
it commands respect for the due process

491
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,639
and

492
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
the rule of law this is the way the

493
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
procedural arguments should be presented

494
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,079
to push back the perception

495
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,240
in the judge's mind that the council is

496
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,519
in a desperate condition

497
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,120
either procedural defense as a

498
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
legalistic approach that lawyer push

499
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,160
so far as to go against common sense

500
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,720
from the judge's point of view and

501
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,680
therefore

502
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
uh such kind of the defense is not taken

503
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,160
into consideration however it's also

504
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
true that while the state has unlimited

505
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,120
means and resources the council's sole

506
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,680
weapons

507
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,079
are the law and the logic and therefore

508
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
this legalistic approach is the only one

509
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,600
that can guarantee

510
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
a level playing field challenging the

511
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,839
merit of acquisition

512
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
ranges from exposing uncertainty of the

513
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,240
defendant's identity to the lack of

514
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
evidence of the mensarea

515
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
required by the incriminating provision

516
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,079
to the inconsistencies

517
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
of the modus operandi of the law

518
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,480
enforcement and investigators

519
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,559
moreover such kind of defense may be

520
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,039
limited to highlighting shortcomings

521
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,400
in the evidence gathered by the

522
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
prosecutor and the technical

523
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
inconsistencies in the law enforcement

524
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,280
expertise unlike procedural defense

525
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
however in this case is more difficult

526
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,799
to give general indication

527
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,960
because much depends on the specific way

528
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
in what specific laws

529
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
change from one jurisdiction to another

530
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
putting the strategy into action

531
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
the council must manage the relationship

532
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
with the judge with a screen

533
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
extreme care this brief consideration do

534
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,559
not exhaust

535
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,280
such a vast and complex issues as the

536
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
criminal defense of a computer criminal

537
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
they represent however

538
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
a basis on which improve the

539
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
professional capability and to protect

540
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,640
the rule of law and the due process

541
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
we without which there will not be

542
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
justice unheard

543
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
i handle a few blocks on topics of this

544
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
talk and other things related to low

545
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,600
geopolitics and culture of digital

546
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,320
technology

547
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,559
here are the links to be in touch and

548
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,559
stay informed about my books papers and

549
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,919
talks the best way

550
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,039

551
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,600
