he's obviously a foremost authority in

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,720
some of the

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,119
things that i'm going to talk about and

26
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
i'm very grateful

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,159

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,719
uk

30
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
so what i'm going to talk about today is

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,399
uh uh

32
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,680
i'm going to look at life after privacy

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,159
shield

34
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
i'm going to talk a little bit about the

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,759
background to the

36
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
latest installment not the last but the

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
latest installment

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
in the shrems litigation i'm going to

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
look at what it might mean for different

40
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
jurisdictions around the world

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
and i'm going to look specifically at

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,440
what

43
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,879
it might mean for japan now it's

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,319
important to remember

45
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
that all of this litigation is very

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
important for

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
legal professionals and for security

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
professionals as well

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
and indeed anybody in

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
japan because i think it gives

51
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
a restriction on some of the ways in

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,640
which you can do

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,160
business with europe but also it gives

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,480
opportunities

55
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
to companies that do things correctly

56
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,879
and particularly to information

57
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,400
security professionals the shrems

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
cases if you like increase

59
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,080
the level of security in organizations

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,879
and the importance of security

61
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,239
professionals

62
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,440
as a result so it is in my view an

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
opportunity

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
as well as a threat so let's

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
look first at the background to all of

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
these things

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,120
now many of you will remember

68
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,599
uh the shrems litigation and how it

69
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,480
started

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
and i've been fortunate enough to follow

71
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
this litigation for many years and

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,680
indeed

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,640
to speak to uh max rams on a number of

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,159
occasions and to

75
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,360
interview him at conferences

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,599
now in some respects this all starts

77
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,920
back in

78
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,319
2011 some nine years ago now

79
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,519
when schrems attended a lecture

80
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
whilst on a gap visit

81
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
to santa clara university

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
he had a discussion then with

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
a representative from facebook who was a

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,680
guest

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
lecturer in class and he made a subject

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
access request to facebook

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,839
as a result now subject access requests

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,959
for those of you

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
who don't know are a process

90
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
under the old eu debt protection law

91
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,759
and under the general data protection

92
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,000
regulation gdpr

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
where an individual can say to an

94
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
organization

95
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,479
in this case facebook give me all of the

96
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,280
data

97
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
that you have on me and so

98
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
shreemz served that request

99
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,720
on facebook and he was disappointed with

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,479
the reply

101
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,360
he got more than 200 pages but he

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
thought that

103
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
was not enough and that they had more

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
data

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,639
on him and he therefore made a complaint

106
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,600
to the data protection commissioner in

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
ireland

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,000
about facebook and the way in which

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
it had handled his data

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
and he made the complaint in ireland

111
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,960
because

112
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
facebook's international operations

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,039
were based in ireland now in july

114
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,199
2014 the irish high court

115
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,240
referred the shrems one case

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
to the uh ecj the european court

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
and by that time of course edward

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
snowden had made his allegations about

119
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
the activities

120
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
of the u.s security services

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,880
and that made the situation more

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
difficult for facebook

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
because it was harder for them to

124
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,639
guarantee

125
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,800
that schremzer's data was safe in the us

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
if the nsa could look at that data

127
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,080
and so as a result in october 2015

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
taking into account the snowden

129
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
allegations

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,520
safe harbor the mechanism that

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,560
many corporations had used

132
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,639
to transfer data from the eu

133
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,000
to the us was struck down

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,759
now the litigation did not stop there

135
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
in november 2015

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
had brought a second action which was

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
effectively a civil action

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
seeking damages he said

139
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,639
if facebook have handled my data

140
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,080
incorrectly

141
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
and handled the data of many thousands

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
of other people incorrectly

143
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
across europe then we should be paid

144
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,199
money as a result and that case the

145
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,840
shrems

146
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
ii case is still progressing

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,160
through the courts as individuals

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
seek compensation against facebook

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,360
now in december 2015 shrems brought

150
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,039
another complaint to the dpc

151
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
this time against something different

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,360
called standard contractual clauses

153
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,280
facebook had said okay we don't use safe

154
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
harbor anymore because that's gone

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
but we'll use some special types of

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,840
clauses instead to transfer

157
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,080
data and shreams made that complaint

158
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,639
in july 2016 privacy shield was adopted

159
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
a new scheme

160
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,720
for the transfer of data to replace safe

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
harbor

162
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,440
and eventually the case that was going

163
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
to the european court about standard

164
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,199
contractual clauses

165
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
had privacy shield joined on to it as

166
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,520
well

167
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
and as we know in july 2020

168
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
privacy shield was struck down by the

169
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,080
ecj

170
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,639
now here there's a point of confusion

171
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
some people call that case

172
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
shrams ii in fact it

173
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
three because as i've said there was

174
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
this civil action as well

175
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
but privacy shield was struck down by

176
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
the european courts

177
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
and switzerland and israel have followed

178
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
as well

179
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
so what does this mean well first of all

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,120
i think that the situation the primary

181
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,519
responsibility

182
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,039
for fixing all of this is with the

183
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,240
us administration the european court

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,279
criticized the fact that the u.s

185
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,839
administration

186
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
does not protect the data of european

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
citizens

188
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,959
and obviously it doesn't protect the

189
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
data of japanese

190
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,399
citizens as well so will trump build

191
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,600
bridges

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
well in my view i think this is unlikely

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
it's obviously an election year and in

194
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,399
four or five days time we might know the

195
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,399
result of the election

196
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
there's clearly an increased focus on

197
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,839
security

198
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,160
in the u.s and lots of xenophobia this

199
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,200
fear of outsiders in the u.s and

200
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
particular

201
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,519
cyanophobia this fear of the chinese and

202
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,640
this fear

203
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
the chinese organizations and the

204
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
chinese government

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,959
wish to take the us over and it's

206
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,480
important to remember

207
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,360
that obama in european terms was

208
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
regarded

209
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
as being much more compromising more

210
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
understanding

211
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
of privacy rights and yet his

212
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,800
administration could not provide a fix

213
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,519
so it's difficult to see how any trump

214
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,640
administration

215
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,519
could provide a fix if the election

216
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
changes that

217
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,320
changes the complexion in the u.s of

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,040
course

219
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,279
the situation could be different so

220
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
how does this lead to any sort of

221
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,240
resolution

222
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
well first of all businesses could try

223
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,800
and use

224
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,079
standard contractual clauses these

225
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
particular special types of legal

226
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,760
agreement

227
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,880
to transfer data and incidentally this

228
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,160
bit of the judgment

229
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
also applies to japan there is no

230
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,640
safe harbor scheme with japan

231
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
there is what's called an adequacy

232
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
finding which we'll discuss a little bit

233
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,079
about later

234
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
but you still need an agreement to

235
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
legitimize the transfer of data

236
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
to japan and effectively in very simple

237
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,760
terms

238
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
the court said that you need to do two

239
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
types of due diligence for standard

240
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
contractual clauses

241
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,600
you need to make sure that you know who

242
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,160
you are

243
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,519
sending data to and you need to make

244
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,240
sure

245
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
that you know the legislation that

246
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
applies in that country

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
so if i'm sat in the uk

248
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,640
for example and i'm transferring data to

249
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
toyota i will need to make sure

250
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,680
that toyota is reliable and also that

251
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
japanese law

252
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,079
has protections for data so standard

253
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
contractual clauses

254
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,200
will be the way in which most

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,680
organizations

256
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,440
will make the transfer of data lawful

257
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,320
at least in the short term there are

258
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
other potential avenues to explore

259
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
such as binding corporate rules but

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
standard contractual clauses will be the

261
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
main one

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
many businesses are trying to avoid the

263
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,279
issue

264
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,079
i have heard this week from two of our

265
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,040
clients

266
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,160
who say that the u.s administration has

267
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,120
told them

268
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
to carry on as normal because a new

269
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
privacy shield will appear

270
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
i think that is very unlikely if it does

271
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,079
happen

272
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,200
the courts will also strike it down many

273
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
corporations are trying measures of

274
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
self-help and that could be things like

275
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
having an ombudsman scheme

276
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
it could be things like having

277
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
external security assessments on their

278
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
data

279
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,200
and it could be things like uh

280
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
undertaking

281
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
to tell people when government is trying

282
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
to look at

283
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,720
data insofar as that's legally possible

284
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
and we're also likely to see reassuring

285
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
words from the european commission as

286
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,399
well

287
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,560
to say that a new agreement is on its

288
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,519
way

289
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,160
as i said i don't think a new agreement

290
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,320
will be lasting

291
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,680
but despite those sort of four things

292
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
that look at resolution there are many

293
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
things that make this more difficult

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,959
firstly there is litigation

295
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
already a german group

296
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,200
has taken action against amazon

297
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
and issued proceedings in munich in

298
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,279
germany

299
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,399
to effectively say that because amazon

300
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,680
says it uses

301
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,639
privacy shield it breaches the general

302
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
data protection regulation

303
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
and that is a significant case if it

304
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,959
can run the breaches of gdpr are

305
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,000
punishable

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,279
by a regulatory fine of four percent of

307
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
global revenue

308
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,680
in amazon's case a very large number and

309
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
the civil action

310
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,079
might entitle individuals to damages and

311
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,279
that's what the

312
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,639
german group is seeking

313
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,079
regulators will act i would think

314
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,560
that german regulators again are more

315
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
likely to act

316
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,040
than many and there is of course a

317
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
shrimps

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,279
for litigation where shrams is going

319
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,639
back to court to try and force

320
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
the irish authorities to take action

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,000
and they do say that they are

322
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
accelerating their investigation

323
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
into facebook so there are some big

324
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,560
threats on the horizon and again

325
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
information security professionals will

326
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,480
have a role to play

327
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,160
here by trying to persuade

328
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,720
people they do business with that their

329
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,000
processes

330
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
are better than other peoples now i'll

331
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,279
just mention in passing

332
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,480
that as i said at the start

333
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,760
the shrimp's judgment is not limited

334
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,760
to transfers between europe and the us

335
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
it will also have an effect for example

336
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
on transfers

337
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
to russia and china they will possibly

338
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
be subject to greater scrutiny

339
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
because of laws that russia and china

340
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
have adopted around the localization of

341
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,360
data

342
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
and access to data by state authorities

343
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,440
why russia and china haven't been

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,279
prominent on the radar

345
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,360
is because there is less commercial

346
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
impetus

347
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,560
many european businesses outsource

348
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,720
hr to u.s corporations they outsource

349
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
travel management to u.s corporations

350
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,079
they outsource

351
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,320
hr and sales databases to u.s

352
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,839
corporations very many fewer

353
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,199
use russian suppliers and chinese

354
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,399
suppliers

355
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
but i think we will see these tensions

356
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,519
rise

357
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,480
particularly as chinese connected

358
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
offerings gain

359
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
in prominence and we've seen a flavor of

360
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,519
that

361
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,120
in the moves from the trump

362
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
administration against

363
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,639
tick tock where they're almost mirroring

364
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,639
the concerns in the european court

365
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,519
whilst disagreeing with the european

366
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
court's reasoning

367
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,720
at the same time and what does this mean

368
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,759
for the uk

369
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,480
after brexit well i think this is going

370
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
to be a somewhat

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,360
complicated situation because

372
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,519
there is a political agreement to be

373
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,399
reached

374
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,240
and without being political our current

375
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,720
government led by boris johnson

376
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
is not negotiating as well as it

377
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
should and at the same time uk

378
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,399
legislation

379
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,120
and the perceived activities of the uk

380
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
security services

381
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
has also been criticized in mainland

382
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,720
europe

383
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,399
what does this mean for japan well

384
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,440
i think japan has done well

385
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
in terms of its negotiating strategy

386
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,360
with the

387
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,040
eu and obviously japan has

388
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
favored nation status as far as the eu

389
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,600
is concerned

390
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
and as far as the uk is concerned and

391
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,040
the uk

392
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
has said that it intends to replicate

393
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,199
the favored nation status of japan with

394
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,000
the uk

395
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,359
when the uk finally departs the eu

396
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
i think there is likely to be greater

397
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,439
focus on adequacy

398
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,359
and i think in some respects this is

399
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
where the japanese authorities have done

400
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,640
well

401
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
so for example only recently

402
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,280
you announced higher fines for privacy

403
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
infringements i think they come in on

404
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,320
the 12th of

405
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
december and fines rise to potentially

406
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
100 million

407
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
yen that will be seen as a

408
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
good investment in privacy

409
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,679
by eu and uk authorities

410
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
we may see annual reviews of adequacy

411
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
decisions going forward

412
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
particularly if there is some pressing

413
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,799
imperative

414
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,160
so for example if there is a big data

415
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
breach in japan

416
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,480
which affects eu citizens there is

417
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
likely to be a greater

418
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
political emphasis for more

419
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,559
supervision of japan there is the

420
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,760
possibility

421
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
of greater scrutiny of the activities of

422
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,000
the

423
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
japanese security services so there has

424
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,520
been

425
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
some criticism of the enquiry sheet

426
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
system in japan

427
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,679
and some uh low-level

428
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
commentary on some of the snowden

429
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
allegations about japan

430
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
such as programs such as x-key score and

431
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,000
mallard

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,280
i think again they're not really in

433
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
the public knowledge as much as the

434
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,360
activities

435
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,960
of the alleged activities of the nsa

436
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,480
are in mainland us but this is something

437
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
that japanese businesses

438
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
and japanese security professionals will

439
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,679
need to keep

440
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,960
monitoring there's likely to be

441
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,840
greater scrutiny of laws protecting the

442
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,720
data

443
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
of non-japanese nationals from state

444
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,240
surveillance

445
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
so for example the new ppc english

446
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,360
language

447
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,640
helpline i think is a very useful

448
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
development

449
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,120
again to try and reassure european

450
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,480
citizens and uk

451
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
citizens that japan cares about privacy

452
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
there is more prospect of pressure group

453
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,919
activities

454
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,720
and there is more potential for class

455
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
actions like the class action

456
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
against amazon and as i've said a real

457
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
benefit of this

458
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,080
is the greater role for infosec

459
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,039
professionals

460
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,600
for cyber security professionals for

461
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,360
legal professionals

462
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,520
in decision making

463
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,039
so i guess one of the uh big

464
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
questions though is can national

465
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,240
security

466
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,720
and data protection ever survive

467
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
together

468
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,159
and you might see that i've used some

469
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,960
quite quirky photographs to illustrate

470
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
my talk from my visit to tokyo last year

471
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,760
and this it seems to me is a little bit

472
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,159
like

473
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,320
peter rabbit it is a fairy tale a land

474
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
of make believe

475
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,159
i think there is always a tension

476
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,240
between national security

477
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,280
and data protection and equally

478
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,000
we see in areas like the right to be

479
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
forgotten under gdpr

480
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
bad people use good laws to do

481
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
bad things so we are always going to

482
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,679
have this

483
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,039
tension between protecting

484
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,720
state interests and protecting data

485
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
protection

486
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,440
rights and in my view this means that

487
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,320
we're going to

488
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
continue to have litigation like the

489
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
shrems litigation

490
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,000
continue to have disputes over the

491
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
transfer of data

492
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,799
so in my view it is unlikely

493
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,600
that data protection and national

494
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,559
security

495
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,799
can ever have a perfect marriage

496
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,120
so how can organizations in japan

497
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,799
minimize risk

498
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,200
well i was touched when i went to uh

499
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
kyoto

500
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,960
by this sign telling people that they

501
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,159
must stop

502
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
pokemon go when walking around the

503
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,640
monuments in uh kyoto

504
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,880
and i think that's a good example of how

505
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,200
organizations in japan can minimize

506
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
their risk they need to give clear

507
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
instructions

508
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,600
both to their own individuals

509
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
and also to the people they are dealing

510
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,600
with

511
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
they need to be very transparent with

512
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,280
people

513
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,120
and explain how they will protect data

514
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,600
and the measures that are in place in

515
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
japan

516
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,440
to ensure the protection of personal

517
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,720
data

518
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,039
so first of all this will be about

519
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,080
setting out

520
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,360
very clear rules this is how we handle

521
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,880
your data

522
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
this is how we keep it secure there

523
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
needs to be a very

524
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,799
strong emphasis on security

525
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
you will need to look at standard

526
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
contractual clauses

527
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
they're sometimes called model clauses

528
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,240
they are not

529
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,280
perfect but they are probably the best

530
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,120
thing possible you need to be prepared

531
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,480
to explain the limits on japanese law

532
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
in some cases this might mean that you

533
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,960
need a formal opinion

534
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,480
from mr takahashi or

535
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,320
eminent lawyers in japan to explain the

536
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
protections

537
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,640
that exist in local law you will need to

538
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,200
look at

539
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
other measures for example potentially

540
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,400
an

541
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
ombudsman scheme to deal with complaints

542
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
from individuals

543
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,679
and you'll need to have a proper process

544
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,880
in place

545
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,679
to make sure that you can deal with

546
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,720
requests

547
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
for data properly and remember that

548
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,360
that's how the entire shrems litigation

549
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,200
started one man made one request for his

550
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
data

551
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,159
and he was not satisfied with the reply

552
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,320
so one individual can change your world

553
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,520
and as a result you have to be aware of

554
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,200
how you deal with employees how you deal

555
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,159
with customers how you interact with

556
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:38,880
people

557
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,159
if you're a large company because one

558
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,799
man

559
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,159
can change your world now

560
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
uh i'm making uh

561
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
i know that i've spoken quite quickly

562
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,679
and that my english is sometimes quite

563
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
hard to understand

564
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,039
and so i've left some faqs

565
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,159
on the screen here where you can

566
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,679
look at these specific links for

567
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,240
some of the topics that i've discussed

568
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,039
the first one is a general introduction

569
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
to gdpr the second one

570
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,960
explains some of the words that we use

571
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
in data protection and in information

572
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,880
security

573
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
in the uk the third one

574
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,320
has a some notes on the

575
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,840
uh shreds three uh case

576
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,400
and a short film there are some details

577
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,360
of the swiss privacy shield collapse

578
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,240
there

579
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,200
a short film about the first two years

580
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,400
of gdpr

581
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,559
and some of the other cases that we have

582
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,080
seen on

583
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,880
data breach for example and data

584
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
security

585
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,919
concerns there's an article on the same

586
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,600
topic

587
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
we've done a lot of work around

588
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,919
corporate investigations

589
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
and the issues between gdpr

590
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,919
and data and corporate investigations

591
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,159
that's on the next link

592
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,600
we've done some work around facebook and

593
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
data protection

594
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,679
impact assessments which are a useful

595
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,760
way of minimizing risk

596
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,039
on the next link and then we have

597
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,240
a film on brands in a crisis that you

598
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
might find useful

599
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,440
and some details of the amazon

600
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,559
litigation

601
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,919
over privacy shield in addition

602
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,559
now it's been my pleasure to speak to

603
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,200
you

604
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,400
i hope that that's given you a flavor of

605
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,080
some of the tensions

606
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,520
between data protection data security

607
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,520
and national security of course i'm

608
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,039
available to answer your questions now

609
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,159
hopefully in the chat if that is working

610
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,799
and if that isn't working do feel free

611
