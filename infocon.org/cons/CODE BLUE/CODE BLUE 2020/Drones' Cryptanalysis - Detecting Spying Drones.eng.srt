1
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,079
our next session is

2
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,120
drones drones script crib

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
drone script analysis detecting spying

4
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,120
drones

5
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,839
please welcome our speakers ben nasi

6
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
okay so hello code blue and

7
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,799
welcome to my talk about the drone

8
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,560
script analysis detecting spine drones

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
let me start by introducing myself my

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
name is ben i'm a computer scientist and

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,280
a former

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
google employee i'm a phd student at

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
bengal university of the negev and a

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
researcher at cyber bgu

15
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
my research focused on security and

16
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,640
privacy of iot devices

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
and you can read more about my research

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,679
at my website

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,320
this is a joint work authored by me las

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,759
vegas professor

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,280
it's a collaboration between bengal

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
university of the negev

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,640
and the weizmann institute of science

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
okay so let's review the agenda for

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,000
today we will start by discussing the

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,119
motivation for the

27
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,320
research we will then uh continue by

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
discussing the detection scheme

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
and the wi-fi fpv channel

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
we will then review um and understand

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,479
the

32
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,079
three stages of detection uh that

33
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
involve in detecting a spine drone we

34
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,560
will discuss about how this

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
entire method can be applied invisibly

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
and at the end we will conclude this

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
talk

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
okay so let's start with the motivation

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
and let's start with the good news

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
you are about to get your pizza delivery

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
much more faster and as a result much

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
more way warmer

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,720
and this is the result of using drones

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
for deliveries

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,400
and this is the good side of of drones

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
they have great potential in deliveries

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
is only one of them

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
however this is how the ugly side of

49
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,040
rome

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
drones there looks like drones are

51
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
turning to a great threat to individuals

52
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,440
privacy in recent years many

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
uh people use drone to spy after their

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,720
neighbors to spy after their spouses

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,680
to spy after random people and to spy

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,000
after

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
celebrities and as i mentioned drones

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,159
are

59
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,760
actually turning to a great threat to

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
individuals privacy

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,159
a new threat that we haven't seen before

62
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
two things also need to take into

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,319
consideration uh the first one the first

64
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,519
thing is that the dome

65
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,040
adoption rates are actually increasing

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
uh around the world and this is the

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,879
result of

68
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
businesses many businesses started to

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
adopt drones for

70
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,120
various purposes and also

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
the second thing that need to be taken

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720
into account is that

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
regulations are being changed for

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
allowing drones to fly in populated

75
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,159
areas

76
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
basically many areas around the world

77
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,519
started to adapt in open skies policies

78
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,560
in neighborhoods and in cities so

79
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
the conclusions are that many drones are

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
about to fly in populated areas in the

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
near future

82
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,280
and also as a result the amount of spine

83
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
drones incidents is expected to increase

84
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,239
okay so this is the list of question

85
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,480
that we try to answer in this

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,839
research in an open skies era

87
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,880
in which drones can fly between us

88
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
how can we determine whether a drone

89
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,479
that is passing near a house

90
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
is being used by its operator for a

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
legitimate purpose or an illegitimate

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
purpose

93
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
and if you look uh on the feature to the

94
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,199
right

95
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,919
you will see that a drone is boxed in

96
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,960
the yellow

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
is being used from the same location to

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
spy after

99
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
an organization and this is what we call

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
an illegitimate use

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,199
and for legitimate use of taking a

102
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
selfie

103
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
okay so we actually uh went to the

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
literature in order to

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
find what methods are being used for

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,479
detecting the presence of a nearby trone

107
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,120
and we found that there are many

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
methods that are very effective at

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
detecting the presence of

110
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
nearby drones and some of them are

111
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
radars others are the video cameras

112
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,080
other

113
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
lidars and other metals include

114
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
microphone aids

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
microphones sometimes

116
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,280
these methods are even combined together

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,479
to achieve

118
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
the highest level of detection of

119
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
drones and basically as you can

120
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,639
able to understand these methods able to

121
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
detect the presence of nearby drones

122
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,919
very effectively

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
however we also claim that methods for

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
detecting the presence of hedoni and

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
open skies that

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,440
are in our opinion irrelevant because

127
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
the presence of the loans is no longer

128
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,720
restricted

129
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
in populated areas and this is the

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
result of the things that i mentioned

131
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,160
before

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,639
uh change uh regulations that have been

133
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
changed

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
and as you can see the difference

135
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
between a legitimate use of hedoni and

136
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
an illegitimate use of a dome depends on

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
the don's camera orientation

138
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
rather than on the drone's location you

139
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
can see again in the

140
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
in the picture to the eye that uh an

141
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,280
illegitimate use and a legitimate use of

142
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,319
the drone

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
are um in this case are

144
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
depends on the drone's orientation

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
because in both the camera orientation

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,560
because

147
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,919
in both cases they were um the

148
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,199
pictures were taken from the same

149
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,840
location

150
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
so the conclusion uh an important

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
conclusion is that the geofencing

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,199
methods are irrelevant

153
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
for detecting a spine drone in an open

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
sky cell

155
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,280
okay so let's review the objective of

156
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
this talk um

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,639
the main objective is to detect the

158
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,199
spine drone using cryptanalysis

159
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
and we'll start by trying to classify

160
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,199
suspicious other transmission as the

161
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,039
first person view channel

162
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
we will then discuss about how

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
the first person view channel can be uh

164
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,280
how

165
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
how can we uh detect whether the first

166
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,120
person blue channel

167
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,520
is being used to spy after the victim

168
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,199
we'll continue by discussing

169
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
on how to locate the spine drone space

170
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,639
and finally

171
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,120
we will discuss about how to detect a

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
spine drone

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,080
without revealing into the drones of the

174
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,240
okay so let's review the detection

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
scheme and the detection scheme is as

176
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,560
follows

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
we assume that there is some malicious

178
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
drone operator

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,680
that is using a wi-fi fpv drone to spy

180
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
after the victim that can be located

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
up to five kilometers from the uh from

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
the malicious door operator

183
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,520
and there is some kind of spine

184
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,599
detection mechanism that is used to

185
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,960
detect

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,759
spine lungs and the spine detection

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,280
mechanism is connected to

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,000
an rx canal with a proper antenna for

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
intercepting a suspicious

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
life transmission

191
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
now now let's talk about first person

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,759
view channel first person you channel

193
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,520
our communication channels

194
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
which design to two things the first

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
thing is to stream the video captured by

196
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,560
the drone

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,440
to the operator's controller and the

198
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
second thing is to maneuver the drone

199
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,520
and there's the downlink and the uplink

200
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,039
and in this research

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,440
we focus on the downlink of the fpv

202
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
channel

203
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
that is used for videos

204
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
now um wi-fi fpv channels

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
are the most commonly used type of first

206
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
person new channel because

207
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,760
for drones because it eliminates the

208
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
need to develop a dedicated controller

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
and as a result uh any

210
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
kind of uh device that

211
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
with an integrated wifi network

212
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,160
interface card can be used as a

213
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,959
controller

214
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
this can be your smartphone this can be

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
your tablet this can be your

216
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,839
laptop moreover wi-fi fpv channel

217
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
now allow uh an operator to fly

218
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,200
uh it's run to a distance of up to five

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
kilometers

220
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440
and as you can see um many

221
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,120
new drones using this technology of

222
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
wi-fi fpv channel dji use it

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
in three of its models which are the

224
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
mavic air the spark and the mavic pro

225
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
okay so when you are using wi-fi

226
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,680
as communication channel you actually

227
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,160
get

228
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
the encryption and the modulation fully

229
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
just by using the standards of

230
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
wi-fi um it means

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,399
that uh when wifi is useful fpv child

232
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
the video stream is encrypted

233
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,320
however does it really make the video

234
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
still confidential

235
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
and during the next 20 minutes i will

236
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
try to convince you that the answer to

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
this question is no

238
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
okay so let's talk about how we

239
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,440
intercept a first person view

240
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,839
channel so given a suspicious wi-fi

241
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,959
transmission

242
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,920
we create an intercepted bitrate signal

243
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,720
which

244
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
consists of two stages the first stage

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,120
is to sniff wi-fi packets

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
you can do it easily by enable network

247
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,560
interface

248
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
monitoring mode sometimes it calls

249
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
attack mode

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
and sniff by wi-fi packets

251
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,320
using a sniffer like elmo that

252
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
allows you to sniff nearby

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
wi-fi packets

254
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
now the payload of the packets is

255
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
encrypted however we actually extract

256
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,760
data

257
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
that is unencrypted and located on the

258
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
second layer of the

259
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
osi model of the packet and we actually

260
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
extract the packet length the packet

261
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,040
size

262
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
and the packet arrival time and we

263
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,320
actually

264
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
create time series from this

265
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,120
two features um and every time for the

266
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
rest of the talk

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
that i will refer to the time series

268
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,000
extracted by this process i will

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
call them the intercepted between signal

270
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
you will know that when i actually

271
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
discuss about the intersected beta

272
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,399
signal i

273
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
refer to this process the two stages

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
process

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,199
the time series from the buckets

276
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
okay um so the first stage of

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
uh is classified suspicious transmission

278
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
especially

279
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
that belongs to a drone and the key

280
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
observation in here is that the drone is

281
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
a flying camera

282
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
so by combining algorithms for detect

283
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,240
for uh

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
moving device detection and for camera

285
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,079
detection you can actually

286
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
determine that a suspicious wi-fi

287
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,440
transmission

288
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,720
is the first person in your channel

289
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
so one interesting thing that we

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
found during this research is that when

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
you take a drone and you analyze its

292
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,720
intercepted

293
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
bitrate signal the

294
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
magnitude um the most dominant magnitude

295
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
in the in the spectral domain

296
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
uh is actually correlated to the frame

297
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,639
per second blade

298
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,780
you can see in the left side

299
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,279
[Music]

300
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760
a um of that was extracted it was

301
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
extracted from an experiment that we

302
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,079
conduct

303
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,320
which we actually change the flame per

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
second rate

305
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,920
every two minutes from 24 fps to 25 fps

306
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
to 30 fps

307
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,279
and then you can see how the spectrum

308
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,519
actually affection

309
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,240
affected the spectrum so in order to

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,800
detect

311
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,360
a camera what we need to do is to

312
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
analyze the intercepted bit

313
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,639
signal the frequency domain find the

314
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,200
frequency with the maximum magnitude

315
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
and compare the frequency with the

316
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,240
maximum magnitude to known for the

317
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,279
second the

318
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,320
rate of drones and the list is you can

319
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,720
see it

320
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,760
in the slide

321
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
however just by doing the first stage

322
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,880
you will

323
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,600
actually classify

324
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
wi-fi video cameras as drones so in

325
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,320
order to exclude

326
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
wi-fi video camera we actually try to

327
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,839
combine another algorithm

328
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,639
which is used to detect the moving

329
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,440
objects

330
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
now this area is investigated in

331
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,560
in research for many years and one way

332
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
to do it is just by analyzing the

333
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,920
received signals confidentially

334
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
measurements

335
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
uh for a given device and when i say

336
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
device i mean

337
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,160
a mac over time and

338
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,120
rssim is also something that can be

339
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,399
extracted

340
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,720
from it's unkitted and can be extracted

341
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
from the same layer that you extract the

342
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,040
packet at idle time for example or

343
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
the packet length and you can determine

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that a device is on the move according

345
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,320
to

346
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
the change of its measurement

347
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
over time you can see it for the case of

348
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,079
a drone for example

349
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
okay so by combining both algorithms to

350
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
one algorithm together

351
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
we can determine that whether suspicious

352
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
hadoop transmission is the first person

353
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,279
if you channel in

354
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,720
four seconds with accuracy of almost 100

355
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,440
percent

356
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,199
and very low false positive rate

357
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,839
now let's talk about the second stage

358
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,800
which

359
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,199
uh which we try to detect whether the

360
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
first person view channel that we just

361
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,000
classified

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
is being used to spy after the victim it

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
means that the first person view

364
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
is being is video streaming a victim and

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,680
in order to understand how uh our method

366
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,279
i want to discuss about the video

367
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
compression stage the video compilation

368
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,639
stage is actually

369
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,320
the stage before the encryption and the

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
modulation of the data

371
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,399
and the standards are h263 h264 and h365

372
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,040
um this type of standards are being used

373
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,440
in

374
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,519
real-time video streaming and they are

375
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,360
used in all of the drones that we

376
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
uh that we are

377
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,839
that we tested in this research and one

378
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,040
thing that you need to know about this

379
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,360
stand

380
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
out is that uh it is called the motion

381
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
compensation algorithm

382
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
uh and it works as follows instead of

383
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
sending an entire frame

384
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
a frame is described as delta exchanges

385
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
from another frame and this information

386
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,079
is

387
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,880
sent in a gop structure a group of

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,160
picture structure

389
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
now there are self-contained frames

390
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,639
which are we call the iphones

391
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
however the vast majority of the frames

392
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
is delta frames which are different

393
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,800
keyframes uh that contain um

394
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
a description on how to extract the

395
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,920
frame

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,720
by using another frame for it can be for

397
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,360
example

398
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,240
an iframe away or a b flat and again the

399
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
the data is sent in a group of picture

400
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,079
structure now uh the result of using

401
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
this type of

402
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
video compression algorithm is that

403
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,160
there is a coupling between the physical

404
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,240
changes in the recorded environment

405
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
and the amount of data that is encoded

406
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
and transmitted

407
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,920
and if there are a lot of changes

408
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,439
between two consecutive frames

409
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,399
large amount of data needs to be encoded

410
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,360
and again transmitted to the operator

411
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
however if there are minor changes

412
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
between two consecutive frames small

413
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
amount of data needs to be encoded and

414
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
again transmitted to the operator

415
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,720
so with that in mind we place a wi-fi

416
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
fpb drone in front of

417
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,000
an led board and we use the led board

418
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,839
as a free health flicker we connected it

419
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,959
to arduino and uh

420
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
and while operating the flicker we

421
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,959
intercepted the

422
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,680
intercepted signal and created it and

423
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
you can see the

424
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,920
picture and we

425
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,839
analyzed it in the time domain we found

426
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,600
very interesting

427
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,120
phenomena every time that the flicker

428
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,759
change from onto off and vice versa

429
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,160
there's

430
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
a burst appears in the uh time domain

431
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
now you can see in here that since if we

432
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,679
have it's a

433
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,559
flicker create six changes between on

434
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,400
two off and off to one

435
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
each and every time that a change

436
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,599
appeared in the

437
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
time uh the change appealed a burst

438
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,280
appeared in the time domain which

439
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,959
correlated to the changes that were

440
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,720
uh were done in the physical environment

441
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
and the key observation in here is that

442
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
the free flickering led

443
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
created six belts in the intercepted

444
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
bitcoin signal

445
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
so how you can leverage this

446
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,960
understanding in order to detect whether

447
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
a specific point of interest is being

448
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,679
video streamed by a drone all you need

449
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,440
to do is to launch a flicker with a

450
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
frequency f

451
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
and test the change of magnitude of

452
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,720
frequency

453
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,080
2f two times the frequency

454
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
of the intercept the bitrate signal in

455
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,200
the frequency domain

456
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,280
you can see it in here uh to the left

457
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
that each and every uh

458
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,480
frequency can be watermarked by uh

459
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,520
by uh using this approach and you can

460
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
see how the magnitude is changed

461
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,480
according to

462
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,799
[Music]

463
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,000
how dominant it become and by

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,919
triggering the flicker you can actually

465
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,760
see

466
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
in the spectrogram where exactly a

467
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
flicker was operated and

468
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,720
in which frequency

469
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
so we can understand whether a drone is

470
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,559
video streaming a point of interest

471
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,200
by operating a flicker next to the point

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
of interest

473
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,320
and testing the influence of the flicker

474
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,679
on the spectrum

475
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,039
of the intercepted bitcoin signal

476
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
the transmission and the traffic is

477
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
encrypted because we are using

478
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,559
unencrypted

479
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,120
metadata okay so let me show you the

480
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,840
videos from two experiments that we did

481
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
the first experiment was

482
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
we did that we did was in order to

483
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,960
detect the spine drone

484
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
when the victim is static and located

485
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,559
inside the

486
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,720
house and the second experiment that we

487
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
did was uh in order to detect

488
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
spine gear drone when the victim is

489
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
actually on the move when

490
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
he is driving

491
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,360
now the first movie shows smart film

492
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,720
that attached to

493
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
the window of the living room and you

494
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,880
can see that we are using the smart film

495
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,600
as flicker

496
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
this is the first flickering episode

497
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,480
and there's a second flickering episode

498
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,160
that you can see now

499
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,600
and in this case there's a the victim is

500
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
actually dragging its car and there's a

501
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
siren

502
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
that is about to be operated you can see

503
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,840
it in here

504
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,480
okay so let's examine the results and

505
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
you can see that when

506
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
the siren was turned on you can see how

507
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,520
the magnitude

508
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,320
is actually become dominant around the

509
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,559
watermark frequency

510
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,679
and you can see the two how the two um

511
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,130
flickering episodes

512
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,329
[Music]

513
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,120
the the first experiment that we did are

514
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
actually dominant

515
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,480
when you are observing the specific

516
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,799
frequency okay so we actually

517
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,880
tested how good is our

518
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,600
systems in terms of in terms of positive

519
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,320
rate

520
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,280
uh how what is what is the rate of the

521
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
false alarms

522
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,440
and we found that we are able to detect

523
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,120
a spying drone with in two to three

524
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,360
seconds with very good accuracy and

525
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,120
very low false positive rate as you can

526
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
see in the graphs below

527
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,760
so as i mentioned we can detect spine

528
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
drone in two to three seconds with high

529
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,080
qc

530
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,080
okay now the first stage is actually uh

531
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
we want to we know we were able to

532
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
classify as suspicious have you

533
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
transmission as fpv channel and we know

534
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,240
that this

535
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
uh radio transmission is used to spy

536
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,559
after a victim

537
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,640
and now we want to locate the spine

538
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,679
grown in space using

539
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,360
actually have and the way that we did

540
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,080
that we do it is spouse first we place

541
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
the drone in front of the led board

542
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,360
and we change the angle between the led

543
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
board and the drone

544
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,159
and we found that the magnitude around

545
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
the water multi frequency changes as a

546
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,960
function of the angle

547
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,200
so we created a function that predicts

548
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
the angle between

549
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,840
a drone into flickers where each flicker

550
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,480
operates at a different see this is to

551
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,559
the right you can see the uh

552
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,880
the function and this is based on the

553
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,600
ratio of the magnitudes of the two

554
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
frequencies

555
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
and we computed one function to predict

556
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
the horizontal angle and

557
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
another function to compute the vertical

558
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
angle

559
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,880
and by using somehow the same approach

560
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,520
uh we created a function to predict the

561
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
distance the radius between a flicker

562
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,159
and a drone based on the magnitude of

563
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
the one

564
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
so in order to locate uh to locate the

565
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
spine drum in space

566
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,640
uh so basically we apply the following

567
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
stages given an intersected big signal

568
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,640
we calculate the following

569
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,280
data free and radius and data and fee

570
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,240
are we

571
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
compute them using the function to

572
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,760
detect the angle and the radius is

573
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,880
computed using the function and we

574
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,440
predict the location of the spine drone

575
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,159
from uh using the spherical coordinate

576
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
known formulas you can see them in here

577
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
and we wanted to test how good our

578
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,280
prediction is

579
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
so we conducted another experiment we

580
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
took the led board

581
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,440
and placed

582
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
and we fly the drone to

583
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,039
very different location in order to

584
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
conduct a spying

585
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,720
against the balcony and

586
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
we try to measure how good how accurate

587
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,679
is our model in terms of locating the

588
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,720
drone

589
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,400
and we found that we can estimate the

590
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
location of a spine drone

591
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,880
with an arrow of up to three and a half

592
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,960
meters

593
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,679
for each axis again in two seconds using

594
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,279
four strips of led

595
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,960
without using any expensive radar

596
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,799
without using any video camera without

597
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,400
using lidar without using

598
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
microphone array only just by using a

599
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
laptop and four led strips

600
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,919
okay um the last thing that i want us to

601
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,640
discuss is how this entire method can be

602
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,159
applied

603
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,600
in an invisible manner so the pilot of

604
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,240
the drone won't

605
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,159
suspect that someone is trying to

606
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,159
detect that the drone is used for spine

607
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,840
and in order to apply the flicker and

608
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
visibly uh invisibly

609
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,840
three requirements must be satisfied the

610
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,559
first one

611
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,760
is that um it should be undetectable by

612
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
direct observation by the drones

613
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
operator it means that if the drone

614
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,679
the dawn's operator is located nearby

615
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,640
and looks

616
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,919
on the flicker you won't recognize it

617
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,640
directly it should be undetectable by

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
indirect observation

619
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
via the domes controller it means that

620
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
if the pilot of the drone will

621
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,799
try to look on the drone's controller he

622
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,200
won't

623
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
recognize he or she won't recognize that

624
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
the flicker is being

625
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
used and it should also work among the

626
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,799
fbb channel in order to for us to

627
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,000
understand that

628
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,120
the drone is being used for spine and

629
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
the way that we did it is by flickering

630
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,520
between two similar views

631
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,960
and we actually took two use of the same

632
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
color and try

633
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,880
and flicker between them and this is

634
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
undetectable by a direct observation

635
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
because this technique exploits the

636
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
inability of the human eye to

637
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,760
distinguish between two

638
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
almost similar uses it is also as a

639
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
result undetectable by internet

640
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
observation via the

641
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,840
controller and it watermarks

642
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
slide you can see that um

643
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
in the picture to the right that

644
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,279
these are actually the pictures from

645
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,000
similarly used that would change the

646
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
chroma component of the

647
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,080
of the color and you can see that for

648
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,679
the naked eye it looks

649
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,799
similar in the use of this

650
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,080
this small bulb are you uh looks similar

651
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
and you won't probably uh distinguish

652
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,520
that

653
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,158
this is another type of color

654
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,919
now we actually conduct an experiment in

655
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,520
order to understand whether it is

656
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,640
uh whether it's this it can be used

657
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
watermelon

658
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
this time at the end of the day signal

659
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,919
and you can see in here

660
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,440
that unsurprisingly as you

661
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
increase the difference between

662
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,400
the use the magnitude actually um

663
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,520
basically increased and all of these

664
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,520
are as you can see in here are

665
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
detectable to the human eye you won't

666
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
recognize it doesn't flicker if it will

667
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,559
operate

668
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,039
near you okay so i'm

669
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,200
about uh to conclude the uh

670
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,559
this talk and there are three takeaways

671
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,080
that i want you to think of

672
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
and the first one is that spying drones

673
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,640
are turning to a concern

674
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
and the threat of spine drones requires

675
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,760
dedicated solutions to protect society

676
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,080
however such solutions such solutions

677
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,039
currently do not exist

678
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,880
and finally the answer to the question

679
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
of whether a country or a city should

680
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,080
allow a company

681
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,520
to use a drone to deliver its packages

682
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
need to take other aspects beyond the

683
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,919
business aspects into account

684
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,720
and for example the ability to protect

685
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
the privacy

686
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,120
