11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
hi everyone my name is anna maria osola

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
and i am working as a senior police

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,080
officer in guardtime which is an

14

estonian technology company

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
and also as a senior researcher in

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
italian university of technology

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
i'm very happy to be speaking in this

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
conference i

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
had the pleasure to attend to attend

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,720
code blue

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
a couple of years ago in person it was a

22
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,640
great experience

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
it's a pity we have to know uh deliver

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
presentations using the screens but

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
nevertheless thank all the organizers

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
for inviting me here

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119
and for putting together such a neat

28
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,640
event

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
i will today share with you my research

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,360
concerning law enforcement's access to

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
transporter data and i focus on

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
the ongoing initiatives regarding

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,479
regulating

34
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,200
law enforcement's access to data that is

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
located abroad

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
and also talking about the element of

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
the global reach of this regulation

38
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
and how this relates to international

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,519
cooperation

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
this presentation is partly based on an

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,400
article

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
i have written with professor dan

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
sventerson

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,760
and which will be published next year

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
and which has been supported by the

46
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,480
maserik

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
university research project

48
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,400
i will start first by explaining what

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,599
are the current means

50
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,280
for transporter access then i will turn

51
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
to the legal basis of such access and

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
and i will finalize with discussing

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,720
what these proposed

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
regulations mean for international

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
cooperation

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
first of all why do we need to talk

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,879
about transporter access

58
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
at all i think the audience of this

59
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
conference is well aware

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
of the wide use of icts of the

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
increasing number

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,519
of devices we are being used we and our

63
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,560
societies are

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
are using every day this also

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,319
unfortunately

66
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,440
brings along the increase of malicious

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
cyber incidents and

68
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,560
this means that law enforcement when

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,720
investigating

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,599
cyber incidents or any type of incident

71
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,040
actually

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,560
will most probably need also to take

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,440
into account electronic evidence

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,400
in fact european commission in 2018

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
has published a report saying that more

76
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,840
than half

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
of all investigations involve a

78
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,640
cross-border request

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,239
to access electronic evidence

80
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
so this means that modern technologies

81
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,519
are not

82
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,200
only changing the way the bad guys

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
carry out their malicious actions

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
but also modernizing and

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,918
making more effective the use of tools

86
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,959
that law enforcement can employ when

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,279
when

88
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,160
investigating these offenses

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
so it is clear that law enforcement

90
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,520
needs

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,440
um to quickly access the evidence but

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,080
how

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
do you do it when often the evidence is

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,919
located

95
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,120
outside the domestic territory

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
of the law enforcement itself

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
so unfortunately when we look at

98
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
domestic regulations

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,560
about criminal procedures then these are

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
often

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
dating back uh tens of years which means

102
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,479
that they are not really up to date

103
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
and not really taking into account the

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
modern investigation techniques

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
and the current situation where often

106
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
electronic evidence

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
is not located on the territory of the

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
investigative

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
state because this used to be the

110
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
situation before that often most

111
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
the evidence would be stored

112
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,320
domestically

113
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
and before i begin with describing

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
different means

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
that are used today for accessing such

116
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,759
evidence i have here

117
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
two examples of

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
incidents these incidents are well known

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,080
the

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
yahoo data intrusion and the equifax

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
data intrusion

122
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
but what is perhaps not that well known

123
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
is how much money

124
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
yahoo and equifax had to pay

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,880
in damages for its users and for

126
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,000
affected individuals so resulting

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
successful class action settlement in

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,199
the us they had to pay

129
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,360
117 million usd in the case of yahoo

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
and 700 million us dollars

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
in the case of equifax so this really

132
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
means that it's

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
not only a question about law

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
enforcement and about

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
criminals but it's also the question uh

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
of these uh companies

137
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,960
or these states or these government

138
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,000
institutions

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
that are being the victims of such

140
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
incidents so

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
relevant for all of us

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
so then how how can we get the evidence

143
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,000
there are several options for accessing

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,039
evidence that is

145
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,160
located extra territorially the most

146
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
well known of them

147
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
is a mutual legal assistance system

148
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,039
also known as mlats mutual legal

149
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,560
assistance treaties

150
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,599
which are usually bilateral agreements

151
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,160
between

152
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
countries they can be in the form of

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
conventions in the form

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,440
of simple agreements

155
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
and these are binding together than

156
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
different

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
national entities that can cooperate

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,400
then with

159
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,199
other entities from the other countries

160
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,080
in case there is a need for

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,479
extraterritorial

162
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
evidence but the procedure

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
for the mutual legal assistance is often

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
heavily critiqued

165
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,080
why well the uh there is a report from

166
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,599
2012 and think about it that's already

167
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,720
eight years ago

168
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
where the council of europe is saying

169
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
that the mla

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
system or the process is inefficient in

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,960
general and with regard to obtaining

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
digital evidence in particular

173
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
so why what what is wrong with the mla

174
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
system that used to work

175
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,639
so well for many years well

176
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,280
the response is obvious because the

177
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,759
circumstances have

178
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
changed so you don't have any more

179
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
the the situation where often most the

180
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
evidence that you need is located on the

181
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
domestic territory no now it is

182
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,560
located extra territorially and

183
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,080
furthermore often you don't know exactly

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,639
on the territory of which state it is

185
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,319
located

186
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,960
so what are the downsides of the mlab

187
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,759
process

188
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,440
first of all of all time this system

189
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,080
takes time it can take up two months

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
up to six months for the law enforcement

191
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
entity to then actually receive the

192
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,160
information

193
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,840
it has asked for and for my research i

194
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,759
have conducted interviews with

195
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
several experts and i had one expert

196
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
from the estonian minister of justice

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
who was comparing the implant system

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
with a message

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
in a bottle so you send out your message

200
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,599
in a bottle

201
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,360
you don't know when the message is

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
received you don't know

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,560
when or who opens it and you don't know

204
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
whether is a response has been sent

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
or when it would arrive so

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,640
it is really difficult to operate uh

207
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
with the m latin

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,680
with such uncertainties regarding time

209
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
when you live in such a fast-paced world

210
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,320
so we know that with digital evidence

211
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
you can just click a button and the

212
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
evidence is gone

213
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
so if you have to wait for this evidence

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
for six months

215
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
so many things can can happen meanwhile

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
additionally mlats may not be

217
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,399
agreed upon between all the countries so

218
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,320
if you don't have an emblet in place

219
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
you would need to operate for example

220
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
based on on diplomatic relations

221
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
the emblets often as said have been

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
agreed many years ago they are not up to

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
date especially when it comes to

224
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
the procedures and necessary measures

225
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
that are needed

226
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
for today's investigations and of course

227
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,839
the other party may decide not to

228
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,800
cooperate

229
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
so this is a diagram that that

230
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,760
portrays uh the possible

231
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
journey of this mla request from one

232
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
prosecutor

233
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,839
uh to the other prosecutor from the

234
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,800
other state

235
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
so you can see how cumbersome uh this

236
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
journey actually is

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,640
now apart from the amoled system there

238
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
are of course other options

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,800
within the eu there are networks such as

240
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
europol and eurojest

241
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
for larger international affairs you

242
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
could use the help of interpol

243
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,920
some countries have established 27

244
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,399
points of contact networks

245
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
this is for example a requirement for

246
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
some international agreements

247
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,360
and then there is of course also

248
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
informal or formal

249
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,959
cooperation between between law

250
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,760
enforcement

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
agencies but but still

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
there are challenges the foremost

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,120
is speed that we already mentioned

254
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
repeatedly

255
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
and the second one is what i alluded to

256
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
already before

257
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
which is known as the loss of knowledge

258
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
of location

259
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,120
so it is not that we have a loss of

260
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,920
location no the data is still somewhere

261
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,360
but we cannot exactly always

262
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
pinpoint at exactly on the territory of

263
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,399
which state

264
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
the data is currently located and this

265
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
is something that has been a dip

266
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
admitted also for example by google

267
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,720
itself

268
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,800
because with the wide use of cloud

269
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,839
computing

270
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
uh having servers and the network

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
architecture the way it is

272
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,360
often some pieces of data may be located

273
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
in different locations

274
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
at the same time or somewhere where even

275
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
google would not be able to say

276
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
where exactly the data is

277
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,959
so this means that it is increasingly

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,040
difficult to understand where the data

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,440
is

280
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
or where it isn't therefore it is

281
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
increasingly difficult

282
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,399
to choose the right procedure for

283
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,240
accessing this data

284
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
and why is this relevant because

285
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,079
we need to keep in mind how the data was

286
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,320
received whether the procedures

287
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
that are that are currently

288
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
put in that state whether these

289
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
procedures were followed

290
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
correctly and if these were not then

291
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
this evidence can be

292
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
can be said to be inadmissible in court

293
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,600
so it's it's really relevant for the law

294
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
enforcement to have the regular

295
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
uh necessary tools set and to follow

296
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
follow the rules that are being adopted

297
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,720
within their domestic frameworks

298
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,079
so what are the legal basis for for such

299
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,600
such an access and this is

300
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
very very wide and wide topic i will

301
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
offer a very brief

302
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
kind of summary the legal basis for such

303
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
access can be divided

304
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,120
into the international law matters and

305
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
domestic law

306
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
i already mentioned on my last slide

307
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,440
elements of

308
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
domestic law that law enforcement needs

309
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,639
to keep in mind the domestic procedures

310
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,240
and if these are being

311
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,440
breached then the evidence can be

312
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,920
called inadmissible in court so this is

313
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,760
why the domestic law

314
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,480
is really relevant there are many

315
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,440
examples of

316
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
regulation in different countries

317
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,040
different countries have approached this

318
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
differently

319
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
also within the eu we see different

320
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
domestic approaches

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,600
one of the recent notable example of the

322
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
domestic regulation comes from

323
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
the u.s the us cloud act which

324
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
requires the internet service providers

325
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,399
isps

326
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,680
to hand over data to u.s law enforcement

327
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,279
agencies no matter

328
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,560
where the data is stored also

329
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,519
the u.s cloud act foresees bilateral

330
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,800
agreements with

331
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,279
qualifying foreign governments to ensure

332
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,600
there are more clear

333
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
more clear procedures in place between

334
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
different countries

335
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
so but the u.s cloud act is a great

336
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
example of

337
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,360
the shift that i'm talking about so not

338
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
we're not anymore talking about the

339
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,839
state to state

340
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,720
cooperation when it comes to receiving

341
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,279
evidence

342
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,000
located extra territorially this is the

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,199
way it used to be

344
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,279
basing this procedure on the concept of

345
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,240
territoriality

346
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
but there's a shift to the state to isp

347
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
or service provider approach so we are

348
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,199
not anymore talking about

349
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,040
a communication that is strictly between

350
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
states as the main actors

351
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
but we have included here

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
now also the main actor as a service

353
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
provider and this is really a great

354
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,600
rate shift that we see in the regulation

355
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
domestically and this also of course

356
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,839
reflects on the international level

357
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,760
um where there are two two

358
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
things to keep in mind in the context of

359
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
international law

360
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,519
first that such transporter access can

361
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,199
be based on international agreements

362
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,120
that we talked about before

363
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
an example of such an agreement is the

364
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
council of europe's

365
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,639
convention on cyber crime also known as

366
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,800
the budapest convention

367
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
which allows to access

368
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,240
data when the data is located on the

369
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,639
territory of another party

370
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
of course there are many elements and

371
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,959
and certain ambiguities also related to

372
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,240
this regulation but

373
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
it is an example of of how this can be

374
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
done and council of europe is currently

375
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,680
also working

376
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,040
uh with possible amendments uh as as

377
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
their second additional protocol which

378
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
would clear up a couple of things

379
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,600
in this regard and another example of

380
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
an international agreement is is the eu

381
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,000
regulation that i will be talking about

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
in my next

383
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,800
slide because this eu regulation

384
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,199
would form unified rules between

385
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,360
all member states so in that sense it

386
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,720
would would really create a precedent

387
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
and the other element of international

388
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
law that we need to take into

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
account are the basic rules basic

390
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,920
principles

391
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,440
of international law such as sovereignty

392
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,920
so the question arises whether if the

393
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,079
law enforcement of one state

394
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
decides to access digital evidence

395
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
located on the other state

396
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,639
without asking that state first without

397
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,240
notifying that state

398
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,120
whether this could be considered as a

399
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,759
bridge

400
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
of serenity of that state so that's a

401
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,160
very very interesting question

402
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,440
and there is no universal

403
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
consensus in in this regard as we speak

404
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
but i can say that that when we observe

405
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,199
different

406
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,199
international and domestic developments

407
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,800
then we can see that more and more

408
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
states

409
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,279
are accessing such information without

410
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
notifying in advance or without asking

411
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
for the permission

412
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
of the other state in advance

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,800
so what what are the cornerstones of the

414
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
european

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,320
union's proposal the e-evidence

416
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,560
project includes two main proposals

417
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,800
and and here on the slides i have

418
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
outlined the main

419
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,359
main points of these proposals first to

420
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,919
create

421
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,959
a european production order this would

422
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,359
allow a judicial authority in one member

423
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:13,839
state

424
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,039
to request electronic evidence directly

425
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,359
from a service provider offering

426
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
services in the eu

427
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,959
now again it's not asking from the

428
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,760
member state

429
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
but asking directly from the service

430
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
provider what we already talked about

431
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
before

432
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
and important to note here is also that

433
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,919
the service provider does not have to be

434
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
based in the eu but it has to be

435
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,200
offering

436
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,240
its services in the eu this means that

437
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
for example

438
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,080
a japanese service provider based here

439
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,600
in japan

440
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,760
but offering its services to

441
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
within the eu must if this

442
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
proposal is to be adopted must follow

443
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,799
these rules as well

444
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,360
and service providers will be obliged to

445
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
respond within 10 days and within 6

446
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
hours in cases of emergency

447
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,559
this is quite an improvement from the

448
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,799
previous regulation

449
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,679
also the proposal offers a tool for

450
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
preventing data from being deleted

451
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
this is called the european preservation

452
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
order which will allow to preserve

453
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
specific data

454
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
to enable the authority to request this

455
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
information later

456
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
via other means such as mla

457
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
and these proposals and these tools

458
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
would of course include

459
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,000
strong safeguards and remedies

460
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,679
in order to make sure that the basic

461
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,240
rights

462
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,400
are being protected but importantly

463
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
for those service providers who are not

464
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,440
based

465
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
within the eu for example who would be

466
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,559
based

467
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,679
in japan then the new framework

468
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
would oblige the service providers to

469
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,679
designate a legal

470
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,799
representative in the union and

471
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,400
this would ensure that all service

472
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
providers that offer services in the eu

473
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,679
are subject to the same obligations so

474
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,080
that would mean to to harmonize

475
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
the rules towards different

476
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,919
service providers and the wider aim of

477
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,720
this

478
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,760
would be to provide legal cert certainty

479
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,360
to businesses and to service providers

480
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,440
and this would also provide certainties

481
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
of course to the law enforcement

482
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
because law enforcement authorities

483
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
often depend on the good will of service

484
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
providers to provide this information so

485
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
currently the situation

486
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,000
can be quite uncertain when it comes to

487
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
whether law enforcement would actually

488
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
receive that information from the

489
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,039
service provider

490
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,600
if the service provider is a foreign one

491
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,440
it can decide

492
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
currently on its own whether to provide

493
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,799
the data or not unless there is a

494
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,520
special

495
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,720
agreement in place

496
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,919
now um in addition uh

497
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,600
to these proposals that i just discussed

498
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,640
there are also negotiations ongoing

499
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,760
regarding international cooperation

500
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
this include firstly a specific

501
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,440
agreement with the u.s regarding uh

502
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,799
accessing data stored by the

503
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,559
large service providers which are

504
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,799
us-based as we know

505
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
majority of service providers that are

506
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
being popularly used within the eu

507
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,240
are us-based so this is of course very

508
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,360
relevant

509
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
and also regarding the second additional

510
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
protocol of the budapest convention that

511
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
we already

512
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,520
mentioned there are also examples

513
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
of data nationalism or localization

514
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
regulation that are being

515
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,240
discussed in different countries this

516
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,919
means that those different countries

517
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,440
oblige

518
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,240
their service providers to store all the

519
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,280
data

520
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,240
domestically and so this is also off to

521
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,960
debate

522
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
how useful this would be um

523
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
in regard to international cooperation

524
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
this is a very

525
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,120
very interesting topic one thing i must

526
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,400
say that the

527
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,799
discussions at the european union are

528
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,080
currently ongoing

529
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
there is a lot of debate regarding these

530
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,520
issues

531
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
i had i have included some references in

532
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,640
the end of

533
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,159
this presentation about the most

534
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,840
important

535
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,080
arguments and and proposed amendments

536
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,280
and the most important or the most

537
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,080
famous

538
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
amendment in this regard comes from the

539
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,679
member of parliament

540
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,679
sigma who has published a report also

541
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,200
referencing the end of this

542
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
pro in the end of this presentation

543
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,400
which

544
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,760
identifies a number of possible

545
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
weak points in the proposed regulation

546
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
so that there is a lot

547
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,320
a lot of debate ongoing within the eu on

548
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,480
how to move forward with uh with a

549
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,919
possible regulation so

550
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,799
i repeat again it is currently as a

551
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
draft

552
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,600
but clearly we see a global reach of the

553
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
proposal

554
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
as i already discussed we don't have any

555
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,320
more the state to state approach but the

556
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,640
state to service provider approach

557
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
uh the service providers would be

558
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,120
obliged to have a legal representative

559
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,000
within the eu and and most importantly

560
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
we are not focusing on the physical

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,799
location

562
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,960
of the data but rather focusing on how

563
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,760
to access the data

564
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,080
when we talk about the japanese example

565
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
then i think japan is in a special

566
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,320
place because of the successful

567
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,480
cooperation with the eu regarding the

568
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
gdpr

569
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
so i think this can offer a good

570
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,799
grounds for also expedited cooperation

571
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,440
between

572
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,559
the eu and japanese law enforcement

573
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,919
entities and also once successful i

574
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
think the european union

575
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
regulation could serve as possible model

576
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,679
law

577
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
what we can see with gdpr how different

578
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
countries are basing their regulation

579
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
on some of the key principles of the

580
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,919
gdpr and if successful

581
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,200
this e-evidence project could

582
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
could serve the same purposes but what

583
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
what are the challenges and what are the

584
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,520
possibilities for international partners

585
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,559
well first of all i think

586
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
there's there will be a lot of debate

587
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
and discussion about the actual

588
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,039
role of service providers i already

589
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,679
mentioned

590
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,080
a number of obligations that service

591
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,039
providers

592
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
would have if this proposal would be

593
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,360
adopted

594
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,960
but also we must ask

595
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
whether it is really sensible to

596
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,720
increase

597
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,799
the level of service providers to such

598
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,880
great extent

599
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,960
for example in regard to the

600
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,039
responsibility of protecting human

601
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,320
rights

602
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
when they have to decide whether they

603
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,520
will give out

604
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
information to the law enforcement

605
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
entity

606
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,360
this law enforcement entity may be from

607
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,279
the european union and may come within

608
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,120
this well-established and and

609
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,679
hopefully transparent framework but what

610
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,240
if

611
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,559
the request comes from a rogue state

612
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,720
what if it comes with the state

613
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
with whom you don't have such good

614
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,400
cooperation

615
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
should you and on what terms should the

616
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,679
service provider

617
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,480
then provide the information then also

618
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,559
there are questions regarding safeguards

619
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,240
human rights

620
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,010
when it comes to possible

621
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,919
[Music]

622
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,559
question of notification should the

623
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,600
other country

624
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
be notified about such data being

625
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,640
requested

626
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
should it be notified in advance or

627
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,840
should it notified

628
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,600
after the access has taken place

629
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
so this all relates to effective legal

630
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,960
remedies

631
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
then i already mentioned serenity

632
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
possible conflicts of law with

633
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,559
different states which may be the basis

634
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,120
for

635
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,970
possible possible

636
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,679
[Music]

637
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,279
possible challenges when it comes to

638
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
cooperation international cooperation

639
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,279
but hopefully what such regulation will

640
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,240
amount to

641
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
is that the investigations will be more

642
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,360
effective and

643
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
will be fast and in a way it is really

644
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
setting a precedent

645
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
as a new form of cooperation between the

646
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,400
states

647
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,640
and between service providers

648
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,919
so global trends as i have explained

649
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,480
already

650
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,279
in my presentations are that the

651
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
traditional state to state approach

652
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,120
is changing there is a large shift

653
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,799
in the paradigm of international

654
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,400
cooperation the

655
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,600
focus is not that much anymore on the

656
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,080
traditional territoriality principle

657
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,799
but rather the focus is on how to access

658
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
the data

659
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,760
so conclusions

660
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
i think it is clear that states cannot

661
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,039
accept

662
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,960
uh input impunity for criminals this

663
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,520
means

664
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,000
that states regional organizations and

665
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
the global community

666
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
have to come up with a workable solution

667
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,600
for this

668
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
and it is best for everyone if this

669
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,960
solution

670
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,080
is as transparent as possible

671
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
taking into account all the different

672
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,600
challenges and questions we have talked

673
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
about

674
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,559
it is really a time of change we see

675
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,440
much more clarity also

676
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,760
it is slow but it is emerging the

677
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,080
clarity in domestic regulation so

678
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,679
different countries are

679
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,000
updating their domestic laws when it

680
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,279
comes to

681
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,799
transporter access but at the same time

682
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,799
there's a lot of room for interpretation

683
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,240
and a lot of room

684
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,039
for debate for example regarding the

685
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,120
threshold of the breach of serenity

686
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,880
regarding the exception of loss of

687
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,320
location

688
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,799
and as already mentioned before

689
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,080
regarding the role

690
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,159
of service provider in international

691
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,720
cooperation

692
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
one thing that we can also observe is a

693
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,720
certain dissonance

694
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
between the actual straight state

695
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,559
practice what the law enforcement

696
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,760
entities are actually

697
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,960
doing and between the regulation that is

698
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,279
written in their domestic laws

699
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,080
so um to to finalize my presentation

700
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,480
i would say that more transparency

701
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
transparency in domestic

702
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
approaches is absolutely welcome and is

703
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,760
needed

704
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,120
and we also should welcome eu's attempt

705
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,640
in trying to adopt a regulation

706
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,279
that would harmonize the approaches of

707
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,120
all the member states

708
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
and i believe that given that all the

709
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,480
challenges we have discussed about

710
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,240
and i'm sure there are many more that we

711
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,760
didn't have time to

712
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
to target today given that these are

713
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,919
being taken into account i think this

714
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,760
can really improve

715
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,919
law enforcement's ability to fight crime

716
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,480
here are some of the references if you

717
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
are interested in these topics and with

718
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,880
this

719
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,080
i thank you for for listening and i am

720
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,640
ready

721
