1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,309
welcome everyone our topic is about

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:15,160
another kind of duty mode the father

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:21,820
taught our ad and mccoys which we named

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,250
passer it designed for for our candle

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,670
for Pudwill wicket in table and the

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,730
secret world and the seed reproducible

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,429
mobile father and it is that I

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,829
identified I will introduce our member

9
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:39,940
understand we will introduce our

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:42,460
solution for path of fasting including

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,640
the fast strategy and the scratch mantra

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,179
and reduce tragedy and our further plan

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:55,569
and finally we introduce our hunt

14
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:58,809
practice where our Father hi I'm - I

15
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:03,429
work for mate when I have six years of

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:06,640
experience in advanced research now I I

17
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:09,250
focus on research about the order in day

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,130
and variability and I've been working on

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:21,730
using or medical assistants 200 advanced

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:24,729
rates log in ammonia and urea I worked

21
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,150
on the Windows platform for employed and

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,370
I wanna believe hunt and the sandbox

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,890
security analysis and now I'm focusing

24
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:36,510
on the mobile platform including ours

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:41,080
and Android for one bleed hunt and

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,990
research and it is it all remember my

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,679
name is Lila and I have a serious

28
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:56,710
security appearance on ours and micro an

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:58,870
RPG and malware detection okay under the

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:06,550
net part we will introduce our patter

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:08,819
solution in t2 and first of our abou

32
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:13,239
introduces the fighting - in comparison

33
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,200
to our different kind of passing threat

34
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,730
fuzzing

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,420
-

36
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:25,488
and according to different mentions for

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:27,359
example not - was the Trinity which is

38
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:29,640
open source

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,880
Cisco faster in the user mode and the

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:39,839
AFL the basic l3 so AFL which is the

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:44,489
femoris called courage based funding

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:48,200
system and also the tree force are as

43
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:51,709
well collar with these are not kind of

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,480
code corrida based the fuzzing system

45
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,640
towards the kernel and also the fine

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,750
wines are were pather we will compare

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,660
different passings according to

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,940
different dimensions for example as a

49
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,340
platform for the interface called

50
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,549
curators apart

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:15,510
driven by support and the reproduced

52
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:20,519
strategy and the depart party according

53
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,500
the platform as we know Trinity the

54
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,489
typical old fashioned the system call

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,100
father with different variations with

56
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,799
researchers configured as a system call

57
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,829
for might for example supreme in the tab

58
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,829
or the written tab it'll record and thus

59
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:41,340
utilize every log of API contest before

60
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,920
coit researchers could only try to

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,220
reproduce the crash by collecting the

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,819
log whereas since the log review effort

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,459
would be huge and reproduced by log

64
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:58,319
would fail for complex scenarios for

65
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:03,930
example if the API correlation is tight

66
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:07,170
so our the reproduce will depends on so

67
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,680
environment so in these conditions it

68
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:17,370
had to reproduce another kind is the EFL

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:21,539
which is which implies inaudible of a

70
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,500
comparative instruction and generic

71
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,500
method

72
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:33,659
sorry under the tree falls

73
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:36,900
he and itself even or override the code

74
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:42,380
occurred based the thinking of AFL and

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:46,710
it view you could tend it so so fighting

76
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:50,390
targets into the kernel and there's a

77
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,830
friend of mine in suburb Heather some

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:59,390
and actually we design our passer

79
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:03,810
according platform so we will try to

80
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:07,370
wrap our father agent a crowding script

81
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:10,200
which is quite crossing platform and

82
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,770
also about the funding interface

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,250
actually it can't was the youth face you

84
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,080
use mode or the kernel mode both

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,630
currently our pattern is not budget

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,780
called character but in the future plan

87
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,860
we will consider I just cook right and

88
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,890
in our solution and about the

89
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,820
reproduction but the pattern is piece

90
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:39,990
answers Eid as we have mentioned before

91
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:44,090
using using the Sita strategy it can

92
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:50,550
save a lot of reproduced reproduction

93
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:56,729
effort ok this is our host illusion

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:06:00,360
Ginty to our the weakened society is the

95
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,290
most composed by different parts so the

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,160
main part is so fast faster agent the

97
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:11,280
right agent is you can consider it as

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,690
executor in the user mode which we will

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:21,330
try to cause attack in the vase toward

100
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:24,990
user mode or anomaly and the other party

101
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,890
is also quite monitor the current motor

102
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,100
will try to counter the crash or how

103
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,110
information of your target process

104
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,900
according whether your device is the do

105
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,200
bricked or non-jew bricked it has

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,580
different strategy under the other side

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,599
we consist that we

108
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:50,219
we will provide our squid squid syrup

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:52,830
because our fat agent is wrapped by is

110
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:58,220
represented by Python or nodejs

111
00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:02,430
like security language so we can easy to

112
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:06,510
save our fasting strategy our fasting

113
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,960
scenario informative script and we can

114
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:14,159
put this all kind of scenarios as quick

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,989
as script in the server and when the fat

116
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:22,620
agent will you try to run to cause a

117
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:25,560
tacit service interview first loaded so

118
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:31,080
fasting script are fasting scenario from

119
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:37,890
the server and run locally the other

120
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:41,070
party is about a secede because gravity

121
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:44,310
has the either his own or the other

122
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,010
entities introdution so for every kind

123
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,030
of crash issues review get as the

124
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:55,080
corresponding unique and identify the

125
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:57,869
seed so we can see this we can save the

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:03,599
seed all the integral into the seed

127
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:06,510
server for reproduction okay about the

128
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,060
 agent the main function is try

129
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,659
to trigger the fighting interface and

130
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,850
reproduce two crashes the key point in

131
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,880
the framework of our example so active

132
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:23,160
easy our kid our system call the library

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:28,200
we can all rather give kind of framework

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:33,660
in the security because great because it

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:38,039
has no compile compile of this effort so

136
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:41,250
we can keep this kind of a solution plus

137
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:45,319
a crowding platform and also we degrade

138
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:51,720
our seed reproduction strategy in our

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:54,990
father agent on a studies secrete the

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,420
server so secretory is mainly

141
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,760
providing fighting salute updating and

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,310
downloading researchers could configure

143
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
so fast grid towards fighting in the

144
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,750
face or even updates as grouped at

145
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,750
random when the father agent is running

146
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,240
okay so correct monitor is responsible

147
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,910
for detecting so crash event for father

148
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,100
agent actually by design

149
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:25,230
after fat event of examples crystallizer

150
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,010
leakage or information leakage could

151
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,570
also be detected by monitoring for view

152
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,090
of passing target

153
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,060
it could be kernel module for example so

154
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:39,960
axonal acronym driver or the other kind

155
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:43,829
of model in driver or kernel or any user

156
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:47,820
mode modules or processes for example PC

157
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,610
or Mac service demons even the target so

158
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,070
is it easy to break so quite monitor

159
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,110
could be deployed inside of the third

160
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,510
device because we have sufficient

161
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,570
privileges to monitor to target the

162
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,000
process otherwise the current monitor is

163
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,540
deployed outside of the device our host

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,100
and the normally is a cried Martha could

165
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,560
detect the device crash event with for

166
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:21,510
example an tuned protocol where are your

167
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:23,969
USB okay so this server a civil service

168
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,960
meaningful collecting so fighting seed

169
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:33,510
for reproduction because before the

170
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:38,910
target device crashes so may the main

171
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:44,520
some main strategy was for 4c Sidra

172
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:48,060
protecting site you can use one unique

173
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,970
unique and identify the integral into

174
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,930
value for example 4 bytes according to

175
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,830
specific Pazuzu algorithm you can use

176
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,339
this kind of value to generate or

177
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,710
sequence of data which is decided and

178
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,370
the by this kind of seed you can

179
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,370
reproduce

180
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:14,570
you can produce the reproduce that data

181
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,570
exactly

182
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:23,820
okay this is a snapshot of our city so

183
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:29,819
er you can see that it's the left column

184
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:32,940
is our crashed Expedia services which

185
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:37,560
year which is a contoured eyeball and

186
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:40,140
each one and this is so sweet

187
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,189
we have our collected two what is kind

188
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,740
of module here so you can see that after

189
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:51,529
running several minutes we can get a lot

190
00:11:46,740 --> 00:12:01,279
of salt maybe hundreds of Aero crashes

191
00:11:51,529 --> 00:12:01,279
kisses you know it's in server sorry

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:12,660
okay you know the odd part is about the

193
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:14,850
fighting strategy so the first question

194
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,839
is why we fighting in secret and the

195
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:21,030
second is how a parting security engine

196
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,839
onto mobile devices such as ours and

197
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:28,680
Android and also and also we will

198
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:36,330
introduce how we repair the hours or

199
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:39,150
micro milk okay we can see that actually

200
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,670
for fighting agent there are different

201
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,640
kind of implementation for example you

202
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,729
can implement it using the native native

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,880
code such as the C or C++ or Swift or

204
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,570
any other object oriented language

205
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,920
supported by Apple and the other part is

206
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:02,459
about the script such as jazz or person

207
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,860
and a review compares a different kind

208
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,229
of implementation by different

209
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,830
dimensions for example wine sorted kind

210
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:17,670
of padding agent is the private crowding

211
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:20,320
used to crowd use easy to part is the

212
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,160
easy to part two different platform

213
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,820
and why the we can modify the fighting

214
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:32,290
logic in either random or not and

215
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:38,459
whether it needs to compare average and

216
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:41,699
the finally we will choose the riper our

217
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:51,880
fighting framework of ours or Mike

218
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:54,758
informative is great and actually we

219
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,870
have for we have some research about

220
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:03,569
this security wrapper solution on

221
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:06,639
different platform for example so i TV

222
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:09,729
framework of kiwi open source free mocha

223
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,259
for our eyes and the kiwi Python for

224
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:18,839
Android and also the node.js from from

225
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:22,779
for for both iOS and Android and

226
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,170
actually we have also compare these kind

227
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,680
of open source a framework according to

228
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:32,920
different dimensions for example whether

229
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:39,790
this kind of framework needed need more

230
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:43,149
privilege also platform or wine syrup it

231
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,540
will cause effort to pouting different

232
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:53,110
platforms and which platform is the

233
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:57,670
pulse actually this is the snapshot of

234
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:00,220
code pieces which review pending the

235
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:07,029
match message our octopus II framework

236
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:10,029
using Python you can see that it is APR

237
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:13,959
attacking the attack surfaces in

238
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:18,579
promoter of expedient method at the PC

239
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:24,119
Creed connection and occipital handler

240
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,120
and also match messages send and receive

241
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,280
okay this right you guys the basic view

242
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,370
of

243
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,709
so how the attack surfaces attack

244
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,790
surfaces impose you to mode and the

245
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:47,170
kernel mode traditionally and you can

246
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:49,689
see that in the left column so system a

247
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:54,250
PP with hyper-v later how act PC

248
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:57,850
services these are all a user mode with

249
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:01,240
high privilege and this al-qaeda driver

250
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:06,040
access new Colonel and I put which is

251
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:14,850
the bootloader these are in the kernel

252
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:20,410
mode there are there are many reasons to

253
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:24,130
why we did kind of API as attack service

254
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:28,890
for example for system ADP's for

255
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:37,439
examples are Safari Apple Store iTunes

256
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:41,830
because in this kind of system Apple and

257
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,550
for equity services because its root or

258
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:49,240
high privilege and also it could be

259
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:54,569
called from low privilege at all sandbox

260
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:57,220
have abs but al-qaida Trevor because

261
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,880
many of the al-qaeda drivers are tries

262
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,610
to graphical video audio and the other

263
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,030
kind of Jared could be easily called

264
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:11,069
from a certain box and the axon you is

265
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:19,839
the kernel which is a cross-platform

266
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:22,688
impose hours and Mike Mike OS okay

267
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:30,610
the other part is the passing by

268
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:34,810
emulation for a long time fast all hours

269
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:39,060
xpz server is best best on AI device for

270
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:43,440
example iPad or iPhone but in order to

271
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:46,960
increase or codec courage we generally

272
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,720
needed to run a large number of cases

273
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,379
due to the limited performance of the

274
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,309
iDevice our efficiency efficiency is not

275
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:58,449
too high it if we should if

276
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,960
officiousness

277
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:06,519
master being pro only a large number of

278
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:11,019
iDevice will be purchased purchased this

279
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,210
is a bigger cost and foremost a team it

280
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:15,519
should be

281
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,129
should be a big challenge so based on

282
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:22,840
the based on the hours xpz service

283
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:28,360
mattify in actually the instruction set

284
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,789
we body purpose the idea would replace a

285
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,949
large number iDevice with armed service

286
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:40,210
service but uh but at present large arms

287
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:43,360
over its price is very very high so we

288
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:48,190
choose a low cost and device it is

289
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,918
raspberry pi there we use a Raspberry Pi

290
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,779
crecer to construct the arm device

291
00:18:50,919 --> 00:19:00,610
cursor which is almost close to the

292
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:02,889
current mainstream arms summer in factor

293
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,219
there is already a similar open-source

294
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:10,449
project on github turning is a Translate

295
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:14,070
translation layer that allows you to run

296
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:18,009
our modified mac OS paralyzed on linux

297
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:23,439
in its nature it is similar to the

298
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:26,830
window wine project he has implemented a

299
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,419
dynamic them loader that you can load a

300
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:35,889
Mac OS X and runtime system library and

301
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:41,039
framework relation implementation so to

302
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:43,479
enable Mac OS X to drum and so on

303
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,950
unfortunately however it can only

304
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:53,649
support x86 best Metro which runs on Mac

305
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:56,710
OS the next thing we need to do it later

306
00:19:53,649 --> 00:20:00,639
turning support our base metal based on

307
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,550
low cost because we consideration

308
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,780
our goal is to chess chess plain ism to

309
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:10,659
the Sperry PI we call it an empire in

310
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:14,980
order to maintain the name continuity

311
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:20,260
but we just borrow his source and

312
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:22,920
rebuild the coder through the through

313
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:26,620
the transplant we have implemented

314
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:30,370
dynamic dynamic load that can load our

315
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:33,699
six and run time system labor like

316
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:38,969
library and the framily implementations

317
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:42,760
to enable iOS exe to fraction and so a

318
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,420
factor we only need to realize Raspberry

319
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,900
Pi 2

320
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:50,920
atchoo for assistant emulation to

321
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:56,770
emulation by Kumu this is a quick and

322
00:20:50,920 --> 00:21:00,760
easy way with this assistant we further

323
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:05,320
mature or even some frank fragment

324
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:08,730
decoder which become easily any i/o any

325
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,530
iris XP server wrong in a bending

326
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:16,000
independently under our word are in PI

327
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:17,649
and expose all attacked service we can

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,210
use a large number of cases that you

329
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:24,910
file it and the cold courage is

330
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,450
calculated by recording the call stack

331
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,360
and new cases are generated by

332
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:35,140
backtracking after the design of such

333
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,850
low cost Holloway emulator we can run a

334
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:42,970
large number of cases which serve the

335
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:47,620
cost and improve our efficiency and we

336
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:51,370
receive a good filing activities should

337
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,560
be extensible and portable which should

338
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,669
be in redmond by

339
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,190
good teacher design and high collar

340
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:03,760
quality it would reduce your match

341
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:08,190
effort of falling is the project is well

342
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,540
did I improvement the queries researches

343
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:15,850
should shoot the pewter or share large

344
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,240
or scenario POC it were the attacked

345
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:26,860
fighting interface some normal scenario

346
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:29,770
POC would be completed and URI URI is

347
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:33,610
the United test case or for video

348
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:37,660
developers arrays beyond the largest

349
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,580
Corp of securities research the most in

350
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,430
error appears it were the tech interface

351
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,730
you get the moral possibility

352
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:49,330
possibility you should you trigger or

353
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:53,170
ability actually the ever hung hung hand

354
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:56,439
or crash case Oh Doris into the

355
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:59,770
fisheries you're further hunting because

356
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,050
with high possible possibility the ever

357
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:07,270
crashed issue would happen again and

358
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:11,169
again to interrupt your fading we

359
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:15,300
recommend this where this this key food

360
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:19,000
which have caught crash be extractor and

361
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:23,010
another whitelist filter or material for

362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,640
example Forex PC server back how the

363
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:32,340
message ID into perfe is good

364
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,340
beautiful filter for expiry funny

365
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:46,090
next I will introduce some models

366
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:49,840
including crash - strategy and reproduce

367
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:56,620
strategy and we also introduce our

368
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:59,580
future plan to stress in our tools we

369
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,320
all know then passing on our system is

370
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:06,879
painful scene is about asperity

371
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,840
algebraic uncharted device however

372
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,300
luckily they have already some excellent

373
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,629
to sell implements the ideas protocol

374
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:20,669
which can help us to communicate with

375
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:24,870
the ideas such as live mobile device

376
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,940
then we can use AI devices dog to

377
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:32,110
monitor the system law whether an ex PC

378
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:37,950
is crushed or exit what small there are

379
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:40,419
also some one or PT such as kernel box

380
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:45,040
when we trigger them they will create

381
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:48,220
ready like ready Diagnostics information

382
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,700
in the crash reporter folder so we can

383
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:55,900
use the idea is crushed reporter to pull

384
00:24:51,700 --> 00:25:01,530
this information for monitoring funding

385
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:05,320
status however protea break this system

386
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:07,510
we can get more privilege so we can

387
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,139
monitor the funding status on device

388
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,559
directory and use the socket mechanism

389
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:19,330
to communicate between father and

390
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:22,720
monitored by a demon this is the

391
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:25,629
frontiers for our modular strategy for

392
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,690
monitor the target so instead hers and

393
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:33,100
we more we monitor the process causal

394
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:35,380
instead of wow its sub process what's

395
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,199
more we also at the system also is

396
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,559
freeze free signal into our fuzzing

397
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,559
tours

398
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:48,600
next we will introduce the repros

399
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,600
reproduce strategy

400
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:56,889
there are many interference factors to

401
00:25:53,270 --> 00:26:02,260
make crush reproduction hotter including

402
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:06,530
rest condition API kasra correlation and

403
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,990
environment dependency for example if

404
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:12,559
the one bid he is triggered by a series

405
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:17,059
of API switch coding a specific order

406
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:26,270
it's difficult for us to get by which is

407
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:29,120
the first API to Costas issue there are

408
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:32,840
also many measure to reproduce the crash

409
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:37,070
here we list for including log case

410
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:41,480
beyond crash dump and seed mission

411
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,970
before we used seed based on procedural

412
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,380
rhythm number generator with Mason

413
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:52,370
twister algorithm to face the targets so

414
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:55,580
for each particle we can simply save

415
00:26:52,370 --> 00:27:01,280
those seeds in the server and no need to

416
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:04,730
sell any middle status or data object

417
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,760
comparison we can found an reproduced by

418
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:12,650
seed only cost more storage and the

419
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:18,140
speed is first was more it only spent a

420
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:20,390
little effort than other measures this

421
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:23,870
is the implementation for trying to

422
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,799
communicate with servers through socket

423
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:30,908
mechanism we you need for transfer we

424
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:37,610
use it for seed transfer during father

425
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:41,750
fathering we only use the sake to

426
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:46,879
transfer seeds and an admission seed is

427
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:49,970
actually a 64-bit data so network

428
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:55,510
transmission speed is right here not low

429
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,510
compared to disk storage sterilization

430
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:03,370
what's more the system is hosting the

431
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:08,270
outside of running target so we can

432
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:14,020
easily redirect the traffic to any other

433
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:14,020
service server and ensure its stability

434
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:21,649
another haunted for using socket is land

435
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,650
we can deploy multi fuzz agent with

436
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:27,730
different server poles padding server

437
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:36,080
will create different folders to sell

438
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:40,630
corresponding data we recommend you to

439
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:46,149
recall last uncie's for reproduction and

440
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:50,620
and should not be too small or too big

441
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:54,110
because it is too small the root cause

442
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:57,620
root cause is causing target crash will

443
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:01,340
be missed because the early exit delay

444
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:06,350
from root cause trigger to final target

445
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:09,409
crash and should not be too big because

446
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:13,129
the most audiences may not related to

447
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:19,070
the current target crash so it would be

448
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:21,470
time consuming for reproduction English

449
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:25,300
cast we reckon you to recall bigger

450
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:29,690
number bigger number uncie's for example

451
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:34,370
tenses and gives the last and subtract

452
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:37,370
em details logs for example - in this

453
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,040
way the redoubt and emcees make sure you

454
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,850
could reproduce the crash while the last

455
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:47,450
and subcode substrate and details logs

456
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:53,719
can help you to verify the crash as soon

457
00:29:47,450 --> 00:30:00,970
as Papa this picture shows the last

458
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:06,560
census logs next we will talk about our

459
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:09,080
future plan we will into we will

460
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,159
integrate the code coverage feed bank

461
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:16,230
for our browsing to like FL hanging

462
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:20,670
files Konami

463
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:24,000
and this is color and we all know nearly

464
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:28,280
all of ours and Mac OS jars and from

465
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,370
library close sauce and so our dynamic

466
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:35,340
dynamic and the static binary is true

467
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:40,169
mission instrumentation is the only

468
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:43,679
alternative measures were small we also

469
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:50,760
spoiled we were also small the position

470
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:54,300
mode like a affair for those fuzzy

471
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:58,460
interface interfaces which could not

472
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:01,320
Excel to for linking or privilege or

473
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,230
preventing by Scotty party check

474
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:09,300
we plan to attach them and hokey related

475
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:13,020
functions for fuzzy actually list method

476
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,389
have already proved possible by hung

477
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,280
fast

478
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:20,330
what's more in order to improve the

479
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,490
quality of impulse tell her for father

480
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:28,800
symbolic ocean will be introduced

481
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:30,810
together input constraint and they have

482
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,860
been already some excellent open so

483
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:41,010
tools for assess assembly symbolic

484
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:44,699
occlusion such as anger we have

485
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:47,840
mentioned that in pay before imprint his

486
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:52,140
ice ax PC service always need to

487
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,689
interact with other expiry service so we

488
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,240
can simulate other excuses our will to

489
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:01,290
implement and communication with the

490
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,100
targeted species always with darling pay

491
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:09,899
and the files are based on the

492
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:12,870
simulation we mentioned before finally

493
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:17,850
we were to close some hunting practice

494
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:23,149
and tong interface interfaces the tongue

495
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:27,750
in the first is many in connect PC Damon

496
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:30,540
demonsaw is and sandbox rich boku no

497
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:34,410
expectations

498
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:42,490
here are the Zoey's got by along the

499
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:46,360
lunch lunch CTL dumb state command these

500
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:53,380
are so is list with their PID and the

501
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:56,040
exit code this is the details

502
00:32:53,380 --> 00:33:00,270
information of found objects or
