1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,509
Julia Birkhoff ah I'm a policy fellow

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,730
with the European Leadership Network

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:14,730
which is a think tank based in London

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,520
and which covers a broad range of topic

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,680
topics including European and

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,290
transatlantic security as well as the

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,620
relations between Russia and the West so

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,660
I'm very happy and honored to get a

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,820
chance here to speak at this amazing

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,610
conference about nuclear weapons and and

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,590
cyber risks it's may be fair to say at

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,140
the beginning that I'm not having a

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,239
specific cyber background instead my

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,530
field of interest is rather nuclear arms

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,169
control disarmament and

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,590
non-proliferation as well as NATO and

17
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,440
European security so the reason why I

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,480
want to talk to you about cyber risks

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,940
risks for nuclear weapon systems today

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,300
is that this is a highly under address

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,610
topic in the scientific as well as in

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,769
the public and another political sphere

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,989
whereby they I think there's a clear

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,270
evidence that cyber will become a key

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,700
aspect when it when we think about

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,048
nuclear deterrence and strategic

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,810
stability in the future so I assume that

28
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,780
most of you might not be familiar with

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,820
nuclear deterrence and global stockpiles

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,369
and NATO arrangements and that's why I

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,770
want to start with some very basic about

32
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,170
nuclear weapons and then stockpiles

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,090
second part of my presentation will give

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,830
you an idea of what do we actually

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,409
understand as a cyber threat to nuclear

36
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,539
weapon systems the third part I will

37
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,570
walk you through some examples of cyber

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,020
attacks that directly or indirectly

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,020
related to nuclear weapon systems the

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,408
third part I will speak briefly about

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,840
national awarenesses and here the US and

42
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,909
France will be examples and the last

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,130
part will be dedicated to some policy

44
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,619
recommendations on how we could enhance

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,030
cybersecurity and resilience in the

46
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:08,579
future now let's have a look at some

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,038
basic knowledge about nuclear weapons as

48
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:13,200
you can see in this slide there are four

49
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,269
categories of state

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,060
possess nuclear weapons themselves or

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,330
who host them on their soil the first

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,550
group is two so-called p5 states these

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,430
are the members of the UN Security

54
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,040
Council the US Russia China France and

55
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,150
the United Kingdom who legitimately

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,269
possess nuclear weapons under the

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,730
non-proliferation treaty or NPT the NPT

58
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:41,250
is an almost global treaty that allows

59
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,179
only for these five states to to possess

60
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,430
nuclear weapons

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,950
the second group includes three states

62
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,080
that never joined the NPT but run their

63
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,078
own nuclear weapons programs bring

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,390
programs which is India Pakistan and

65
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,310
Israel I put Israel in italics because

66
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,170
it never publicly confirmed it has

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,540
nuclear weapons but it's quite clear

68
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,328
that Israel has an arsenal the third

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,090
country is some is a country that made

70
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,819
headlines globally during the last month

71
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,420
in particular which is North Korea the

72
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,839
country joint a NPT in 1985 and

73
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,760
unilaterally withdrew in 2003 in order

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,010
to develop its own nuclear weapons

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,530
program and since there was no formal

76
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,380
procedure to to withdraw from the NPT

77
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,620
the DPRK is regarded as being in preach

78
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,930
of the treaty and last but not least a

79
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,910
very interesting interesting group of

80
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,130
states that do not possess nuclear

81
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,760
weapons themselves but Hirst in total

82
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,280
about 200 to 250 US nuclear weapons on

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,069
the soil due to the so called Native

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,590
NATO nuclear sharing arrangement which

85
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:50,310
is basically a form of deterrence

86
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:54,120
against Russia and this is caught this

87
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,680
is interesting because these weapons do

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,019
not really belong to the countries they

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,079
just host them which is Germany Italy

90
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:06,630
Belgium the Netherlands and Turkey so in

91
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,670
the next slide you can see how many

92
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,668
warheads each of the nuclear weapon

93
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,130
states holds by now except for the NATO

94
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,410
nuclear sharing countries the total

95
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,620
number is about 15,000 nuclear weapons

96
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,380
worldwide approximately 90% of them are

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,520
in the hands of the US and Russia both

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,699
of them have about 6500 nuclear weapons

99
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,000
in China have about 300 India and

100
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,780
Pakistan between 130 and hundred 40 the

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,870
UK a bit more than 200 Israel about 80

102
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,789
and North Korea is said to have about 50

103
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,289
nuclear weapons so to better understand

104
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,750
where there could be a threat coming

105
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:52,110
from the cyber nuclear Nexus we should

106
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,090
first understand what actually what

107
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,440
actually is a nuclear weapons system and

108
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,359
what what are its components so when I

109
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,990
hear people talking about nuclear

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,419
weapons bearden politics or in the media

111
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,150
or even in the academic field they

112
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,620
sometimes only refer to one part of the

113
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,960
nuclear weapon system which is the

114
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,909
nuclear weapon or the warhead itself so

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,090
you can see this on the left side of the

116
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:22,469
slide I put there a small w88 term

117
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:26,068
thermonuclear warhead as an example or

118
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,659
they just refer to the nuclear warhead

119
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,849
and its delivery system which is

120
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,500
basically aircraft ballistic and cruise

121
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,050
missiles and drones maybe you heard

122
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,539
about President Putin talking about

123
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,020
developing a nuclear-armed underwater

124
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:43,440
drone but the nuclear weapons system

125
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,690
itself includes far more there is for

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,759
example the nuclear planning in case of

127
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,669
NATO it's for example the nuclear

128
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,440
planning group where all NATO states

129
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,539
participate except for France they are

130
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,699
early warning system which is usually a

131
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,639
2-fold system made up of Rada and

132
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,680
satellites then we have of course the

133
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,569
command and control centers we have

134
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,969
various communication channels and

135
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:08,669
platforms like aircraft carriers and

136
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:12,000
submarines reen's which you can see on

137
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:14,580
the top right side so this is of course

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
a very simplified overview because there

139
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,490
are for example a variety of different

140
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,169
types of missiles and aircraft etc which

141
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:27,000
I did not include in my presentation

142
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:33,120
because that would take us too far so

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,130
now coming to the question what actually

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,540
poses a threat to nuclear weapon systems

145
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,670
maybe you've heard this famous quote by

146
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,580
Donald Rumsfeld in 2002 where he

147
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:46,190
basically said sometimes we don't know

148
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,260
what we don't know and that's exactly

149
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,450
what should make us absolutely nervous

150
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:54,620
about nuclear cyber incidents that we

151
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,810
don't know what we don't know so when we

152
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,910
want to understand the threat we have to

153
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,460
look at different aspects so the first

154
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,590
question is who are the potential actors

155
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,900
who might be interested in carrying out

156
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,900
a cyber attack against any nuclear

157
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,060
weapon systems there are researchers who

158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,340
stick to the point that when you want to

159
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,230
cause a huge physical damage to your

160
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,140
nuclear weapons system you need to have

161
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,420
vast resources you need to have capable

162
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,909
personnel and of course to know that so

163
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,280
it's easier for States to carry out

164
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,370
these types of a text and for

165
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,099
individuals or non-state actor groups

166
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,170
others think that non active groups or

167
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,210
non-state actor groups like terrorist

168
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,430
groups or maybe organized crime groups

169
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,930
might be more interested because they

170
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,890
have nothing to lose in terms of

171
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:45,110
reputation but if we look for example at

172
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,560
a Stuxnet attack which was probably

173
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,990
designed by the US and Israel to attack

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,050
Iranian nuclear facilities or for

175
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,000
example at us who send warnings to the

176
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,920
DPRK that it could infiltrate its

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,150
nuclear weapon system then we see that

178
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,890
national actors do it in in fact have a

179
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,280
clear interest in carrying out cyber

180
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:10,159
attacks as well at least in theory so

181
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,219
second what types of attacks do exist

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,810
friendly speaking there's not a clear

183
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,840
definition of cyber attacks in a nucleus

184
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,360
fear so like in any other field it could

185
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,799
range from a sick simple help hacking to

186
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,360
nuisance cyber espionage infiltration

187
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,480
infiltration sabotage jamming and

188
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,190
spoofing to physical damage and on the

189
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,349
top of the letter nuclear escalation we

190
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,200
also have to differentiate between an

191
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,180
enabling and disabling attack so an

192
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,700
enabling attack means that a nuclear

193
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,160
weapon might be launched inadvertently

194
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,650
as a result of a false warning for

195
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,360
example on the other hand a disabling

196
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,189
attack would hinder the launch of a

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,959
nuclear weapon and

198
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,209
two possible targets of a cyberattack

199
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,000
and we will speak about this in a minute

200
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,550
is any part of the command and control

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,029
and communication structure referred to

202
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,459
as either C 2 or C 3 whether you you

203
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,290
take in communication or not as well as

204
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:14,209
any state within the nuclear supply

205
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:16,819
chain including power grids so the next

206
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,920
crucial question is what are the

207
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:20,509
possible implications for strategic

208
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,670
stability between nation states

209
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:24,230
especially when we keep in mind that at

210
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,229
least a year transatlantic community

211
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,269
finds itself in kind of a renewed Cold

212
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,310
War situation and key nuclear arms

213
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,870
control treaties and agreements are

214
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,109
about to fade away thinking only about

215
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,879
Iran deal and the INF treaty and maybe

216
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,389
the New START treaty as well and in

217
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,339
future so even in a less tense situation

218
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:46,040
than we face now the very possibility of

219
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,839
a cyber attack could undermine mutual

220
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,329
trust and understanding and also

221
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,009
progress in arms control globally it

222
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,810
could also undermined a trust in your

223
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,579
own nuclear weapon system because you

224
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,279
you can never be sure it hasn't been

225
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:00,649
compromised yet it could also contribute

226
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,959
to lowering the threshold for escalation

227
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,089
of course and here we have the serious

228
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,209
program of the attribution of a

229
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,850
cyberattack like in any other field but

230
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:14,689
despite of all this when we look at

231
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:18,319
nuclear deterrents as a concept as long

232
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:20,540
as they're on well the implications are

233
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:22,969
that grave in the short or midterm on

234
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,189
nuclear deterrence as a concept which

235
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,500
means that as long as there is not a

236
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:30,199
definite trend towards amaya cyber

237
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,689
attacks nuclear deterrence as the

238
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:35,719
primary security guarantee for nation

239
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:38,480
states will not be undermined noble

240
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,880
state starts you to immediately disarm

241
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,519
because they think there could be cyber

242
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,180
attacks in the future but still as I

243
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,129
mentioned above there will be possibly a

244
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,229
harmful effect on mutual trust and

245
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,779
understanding and nuclear deterrence

246
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,170
might get less foreseeable and metal and

247
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:59,360
possibly less controllable so that means

248
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,029
we couldn't keep on relying on historic

249
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,020
knowledge about nuclear deterrence and

250
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,970
how it works in the best case

251
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,460
ideal setting but in state states we'll

252
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:17,140
always have to include cyber in their

253
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:18,730
national planning in the future so with

254
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,130
the next two slides I would like to give

255
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,710
you an idea of where the nuclear comma

256
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,320
command control and communication

257
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,020
systems as well as the nuclear supply

258
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,200
chain are vulnerable to a possible cyber

259
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,970
attack and please keep in mind what a

260
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,630
what I meant that I mentioned there's a

261
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,790
variety of possible types of attacks so

262
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,510
this will never be an exhaustive list of

263
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,310
course but rather the attempt to make

264
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,770
the threat more understandable for you

265
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,250
and to give you some more concrete

266
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:54,370
examples so you can see the read errors

267
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,110
in the slide each of them symbolizes a

268
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,290
cyber attack or maybe a malware

269
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,150
infiltration the boxes and the symbols

270
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,459
are different parts of the nuclear

271
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,590
weapons system as we already know it

272
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,240
from the slide at the beginning another

273
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,240
question is what what could happen

274
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,790
possibly something that could be done

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,400
rather easily is that communication

276
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,980
between key actors is being disrupted or

277
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,620
disabled for example communication

278
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,480
between senior military leaders in the

279
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,040
command and control centers could be

280
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,020
disrupted or between a national command

281
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,630
and control and its counterpart in

282
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,060
Allied countries this applies mostly to

283
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,480
to NATO countries the whole nuclear

284
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,829
planning structure could be compromised

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,310
for example if they don't get vital

286
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,620
information about their own system or

287
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,650
about for example about incoming threat

288
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,110
from from adversaries and communication

289
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:53,170
channels with delivery systems and

290
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,120
platforms could be disrupted as well so

291
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,760
another scenario is that there is a

292
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,710
false warning of attack thanks to cyber

293
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,880
spoofing this is very crucial that's why

294
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,470
I put it in red if for example the right

295
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,380
a sense of warning to the command and

296
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,810
control that there's a missile flying

297
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,570
over to a country they might be not

298
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,250
enough time to wait for sufficient

299
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:20,560
additional data coming from satellites

300
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,800
so this could force a state to to answer

301
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,569
by launching a nuclear what what the

302
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,859
state thinks is a nuclear second strike

303
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:32,560
but in fact is a nuclear first truck

304
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,690
next scenario is that a security system

305
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,119
which keeps warheads missiles aircraft

306
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,160
etc safe and secure get compromised

307
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,010
think about a possible theft of a

308
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,079
warhead and of course an attack does not

309
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,240
have to be carried out remotely but

310
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,780
could also come from an insider whether

311
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,760
he does that deliberately or not and one

312
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,980
last very frightening scenario is that

313
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,280
another state or maybe a state-sponsored

314
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,160
group gets access to an adversary's

315
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,079
nuclear weapon systems and gets control

316
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,180
over their nuclear weapons and

317
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,550
authorizes a launch remotely so the

318
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,280
other sensitive area is the whole

319
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,530
nuclear weapons supply chain the supply

320
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,709
chain could be infiltrated at any stage

321
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,839
a potential attacker will always strive

322
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,330
to find a weakest link in the supply

323
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,180
chain so you can see the different

324
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,700
phases again very simplified to make it

325
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,280
less complex in the slide the supply

326
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,190
chain can be compromised at a very early

327
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,680
stage namely the system architectures

328
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,600
and the design process for example a

329
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,390
computer chip could get compromised so

330
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,490
that hackers could later exfiltrate data

331
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,400
from the chip while the chip itself

332
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,960
seems to function normally so computer

333
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,939
chips are indeed a very interesting

334
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,740
example in this in this case because

335
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,110
most of the countries do not produce

336
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,240
them themselves on the National Defense

337
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,270
unit but instead purchased them from the

338
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,710
global markets that's that's highly

339
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,780
crucial here attacks on manufacturers

340
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,540
and private firms can potentially

341
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:10,449
include efforts to steal data to corrupt

342
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,540
data to sabotage equipment and to

343
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,910
disable networks and although attacks

344
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,670
like the Stuxnet attack and wanna cry

345
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,800
ransom wear are to date very rare

346
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,459
examples of successful and serious

347
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,689
attacks the complexities and

348
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,690
interdependencies within a supply chain

349
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,740
are on the rise which in fact means that

350
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,620
risks are multiplying

351
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,899
constantly and on the level of state-run

352
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,420
nuclear weapons programs if we're in the

353
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,490
next stage remote interference plays an

354
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,339
important role but also insider threat

355
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,140
threats as we as we saw in the last

356
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,230
slide either they are deliberately

357
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,540
carried out or not and a further

358
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,600
critical stage is the process of

359
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:59,060
maintenance upgrades and modernization

360
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,610
because of course nuclear weapons have

361
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,310
to be captain as modern assays as safe

362
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,440
and secure as they could but at the same

363
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,329
time the more sophisticated a system

364
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,940
gets the more vulnerable it is to

365
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,800
attacks so we always think we make them

366
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,360
more safe and more secure once we

367
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,750
modernize them but at the same time it

368
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,700
carries huge risks for us and of course

369
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,700
the power grid could also be infiltrated

370
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:31,160
so maybe you still think that a cyber

371
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,130
attack on nuclear or nuclear related

372
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,800
systems are a bit too fictional so to

373
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:43,670
dispel your doubts a bit let me give you

374
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:45,800
some examples the first one is that

375
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,370
computer scream of a nuclear watch

376
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,620
officer say in the US indicates that one

377
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,290
or more Russian intercontinental

378
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,140
ballistic missiles are about to hit any

379
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,420
target in the United States so how could

380
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,209
the officer be sure that this is not

381
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,629
just cyber spoofing and more importantly

382
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,800
how will this respond hope will

383
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:10,459
dispersant respond taking into account

384
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,500
the very short time for a decision so

385
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:15,589
something similar happened maybe you

386
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,140
remember that back in 1983 when a random

387
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:22,520
Soviet officer was confronted with five

388
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:25,100
or more US ICBMs flying over to Russia

389
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,079
and he decided not to authorize a

390
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,600
counter attack and of course this was

391
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,460
just in a computer era at that time but

392
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,530
it's just it's pretty conceivable that a

393
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,940
similar effect could be caused

394
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:41,389
deliberately by a cyber attack another

395
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,460
scenario is that military officials are

396
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,480
not able to communicate with their

397
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,360
personal

398
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,880
trolling the nuclear weapons during an

399
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,159
international crisis so what would they

400
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,890
think had happened and how will they

401
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,850
respond so again the question is that

402
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:02,059
plausible there was a similar incident

403
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,629
back in 2010 when American launch

404
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:08,690
control officers have lost for the whole

405
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,570
time of 45 minutes communication with a

406
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:15,020
squadron of 50 nuclear tipped ICBMs in

407
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,210
Wyoming so this too was the result of a

408
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,280
technical malfunction but here again

409
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,870
it's possible that a corresponding

410
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,399
effect could be caused deliberately by a

411
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,830
cyberattack and also in general if

412
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,350
officials discover malware on a nuclear

413
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,540
critical system and they suspect that

414
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,790
this was just a tip of the well the

415
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,280
cyber iceberg how will they react what

416
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,860
would they think and this is the reason

417
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,580
why the u.s. National Nuclear Security

418
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,979
Administration stated two years ago the

419
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,990
trend toward a non domestic supply chain

420
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,990
four components of nuclear weapons and

421
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:53,440
related systems may pose risks to these

422
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,330
weapons and systems so this indicates

423
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:02,510
very clearly that they are aware of the

424
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:05,689
risk at least in the u.s. so do you

425
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,730
still have doubts if so please look at a

426
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,419
picture I think you will clearly

427
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:13,910
remember - that was a computer error a

428
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:16,130
few months ago and that shocked have I

429
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,500
during the very height of the North

430
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,320
Korean crisis when Hawaiians thought a

431
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:26,870
ballistic missile was flying over - to

432
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,520
them so in the third part of my

433
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,340
presentation I will talk about some

434
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,980
cyber attacks on directly or indirectly

435
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,320
nuclear related systems that happened in

436
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,340
the past years and again that's not an

437
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,290
exhaustive list it's just a a couple of

438
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,770
examples that might be interesting for

439
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:48,260
you so I will start with what New York

440
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,690
Times columnist David Sanger described

441
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,240
as the most sophisticated cyber weapon

442
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,820
ever developed and this was the Stuxnet

443
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,770
worm attack which emerged in 2010 and

444
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,399
targeted some 15 Iranian nuclear

445
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,760
facility

446
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,610
he's including the Natanz that's one of

447
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,070
the key Iranian and nuclear facilities

448
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:10,669
you can see a satellite picture on the

449
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,770
bottom right side from 2003 Stuxnet

450
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,110
infiltrated numerous computer systems

451
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,110
targeting the windows-based step7

452
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:21,139
software and it was highly invasive and

453
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:24,290
what it made it so so destructive was

454
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:28,040
just its ability to replicate itself and

455
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:31,040
as a consequent about more than 980 year

456
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,620
uranium enriching centrifuge in Iran

457
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,980
started destroying themselves so the

458
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,760
designers are still being unknown

459
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,120
officially but there's a strong

460
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,190
indication that this was a warm attack

461
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,439
designed by the US and Israel who both

462
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:50,870
had an interest in halting Iran's

463
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,270
clandestine nuclear weapons program so I

464
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,010
mentioned earlier in my presentation

465
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,680
that private sector companies pose a

466
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,500
risk because they could become the weak

467
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,170
link in a supply chain a number of cyber

468
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,420
attacks were carried out against private

469
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,340
private firms during the last years and

470
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,250
some of them were made public which is

471
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,870
not which is not so usable because

472
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,080
normally tech firms are not so

473
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:19,090
interested in making these things public

474
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:22,250
because of the fear of reputational loss

475
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:25,189
but we know of some attacks including

476
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,330
against General Motors Boeing and

477
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,730
Lockheed Martin

478
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,520
so Lockheed Martin is an interesting

479
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,200
example it fell victim to a cyber attack

480
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,770
back in 2011

481
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,360
apparently conducted by a Chinese

482
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:41,720
businessmen and Lockheed Martin

483
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,600
developed for example the f-35 lightning

484
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,790
ii and f16 aircraft it sells

485
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,850
anti-ballistic missile defense systems

486
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:52,220
it provides unmanned and autonomous

487
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:57,469
systems missiles submarines rudder

488
00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:00,290
sensors etc so to take the f-35 35

489
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,570
aircraft as an example it is not nuclear

490
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,030
capable yet but there are plans to

491
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,520
develop a nuclear capable f-35 in the

492
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,010
future which might be purchased by by

493
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,240
European states that host American

494
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,240
nuclear weapons as well

495
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:20,330
another example being asked whether

496
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:22,129
there has been an ease I'm not coming

497
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,779
back to you to Lockheed Martin they were

498
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,179
asked whether there has been any serious

499
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:28,850
damage following the attack and Lockheed

500
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,440
Martin just stated shortly after the

501
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,230
attack was made public that their

502
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,659
systems remain secure that no customer

503
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,580
program or employee personal data has

504
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:40,450
been compromised but from my perspective

505
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,370
we could never be sure that this is true

506
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,409
so another concerning issue - fighter

507
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,299
aircraft is the statement that German

508
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,490
defense minister was a LOF on a lion

509
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:52,370
mate during the Munich Security

510
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,889
Conference this year and she said while

511
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,299
it may be hard to use a missile - to

512
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:59,269
actually shoot down a Eurofighter

513
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:01,700
Typhoon which is by the way an aircraft

514
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:04,399
developed by Germany Italy Spain and the

515
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,879
UK and she said it is relatively easy to

516
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:10,100
bring one down through a simple hacking

517
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:13,279
the Eurofighter Typhoon again is not

518
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,199
nuclear capable yet but a new Europe

519
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,750
fighter model which will be developed

520
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,879
jointly by Germany and France could be

521
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,559
and a question here remains as to

522
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:22,549
whether this model will be safe and

523
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,529
secure

524
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:30,350
regarding cyberattacks so my third slide

525
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:34,700
on examples for cyber vulnerabilities

526
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:36,949
and attacks on specific systems is about

527
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,419
UK's nuclear weapons system called

528
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,990
Trident and the terminal high altitude

529
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:44,990
area defense system called Tod so you

530
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,600
might know there are concerns of whether

531
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,990
UK's nuclear deterrent which fully

532
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,269
relies on for vanguard-class submarines

533
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,220
could be highly vulnerable to a may a

534
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:58,940
hacking attack so each of these

535
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,429
submarines carries a trident to see

536
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,039
launched ballistic missiles and up to 40

537
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,169
warheads and one reason for concern is

538
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:08,210
that a submarine command systems updated

539
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,490
version is based upon a version of

540
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,039
Windows XP which has been installed on

541
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,070
all active royal class Royal Navy

542
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,470
submarine classes and we know XP as you

543
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,090
certainly know was the operating system

544
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,120
which was targeted by the wanna cry

545
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,299
ransomware in May 2017 that also

546
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,820
disrupted cards after Nash

547
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,649
Health Service and other companies

548
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,789
worldwide for example it halted

549
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:35,918
protection at a Honda Copland and Japan

550
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:37,869
so for certain time systems like Trident

551
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,940
we're perceived as being fully safe and

552
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:42,668
secure because submarines are air gapped

553
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,249
once they've submerged but it's not true

554
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:48,159
for two simple reasons first the

555
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:50,169
submarine is of course not always below

556
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,210
the surface and and breaches could

557
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,639
happen during maintenance once the

558
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,639
submarine is stocked and second air

559
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:59,649
gapping could easily overcome through an

560
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,600
infected USB throat drive for example

561
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:04,359
like it happened with the Natanz nuclear

562
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,219
facility which was which was air gap

563
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:10,570
during the time when the Stuxnet attack

564
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:13,029
happened now if you look at the bottom

565
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,269
left side of the slide you can see the

566
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:19,210
tart system which is a u.s. developed

567
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:20,830
anti-ballistic missile system developed

568
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,799
by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Space

569
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,960
Systems company and currently deployed

570
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:30,070
in Guam and South Korea

571
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,619
so in 2017 the u.s. security firm fire I

572
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,230
announced that a beliefs heart has been

573
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,480
hacked by a state-sponsored Chinese

574
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:40,059
group so a spy

575
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,379
stay a spokesperson with the South

576
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,350
Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs

577
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:46,209
confirmed that it has indeed been an

578
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,730
attempted cyber attack on their systems

579
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,679
originating from China but I wouldn't

580
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:56,559
confirm that Todd was targeted in

581
00:25:50,679 --> 00:26:00,039
particular and recently I just noticed

582
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,960
something that was that did not happen

583
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:06,220
last night but it was revealed last

584
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:11,139
night which was the data of French

585
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:13,659
construction company called in I don't

586
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:17,289
know how it how it's pronounced has been

587
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:19,210
stolen and apparently about 11,000 data

588
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,940
files have been stolen from that company

589
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:30,429
which builds for example a nuclear power

590
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:35,019
plants and prisons so I will go through

591
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:36,580
the next slides very quickly due to time

592
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:38,710
reason so the next two slides are

593
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,350
trustee awareness for cyber threats for

594
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:45,100
to national perspective and I took US

595
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:48,668
and France as examples here because in

596
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,260
the u.s. they are very aware of the

597
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:52,630
cyber threat for their nuclear weapon

598
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,700
systems they are quite impaired about

599
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,039
the nuclear weapons and about their

600
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,399
concerns per se and I put together just

601
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,980
a couple of notes for quotes from public

602
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:05,408
sources the first is from the retired

603
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,750
general robert kayla who was the

604
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:09,669
commander of the u.s. stretch comm which

605
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,419
is responsible for the nuclear weapons

606
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:16,450
and he said being asked by the Senate

607
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:18,370
Armed Services Committee in 2013 we are

608
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,399
very concerned with the potential of

609
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,620
size of a cyber related attack on our

610
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:27,100
nuclear command and control and on a

611
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,918
weapon systems themselves and as a

612
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,559
result in 2017 a task force on cyber

613
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,840
deterrence made a recommendation to

614
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,690
contact an annual assessment of the

615
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,879
cyber resilience of the US nuclear

616
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,669
deterrent including all essential

617
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,429
nuclear thinline components which means

618
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:50,799
nc3 platforms delivery systems and

619
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:52,659
warheads and also in April 2017 the Air

620
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,200
Force general John Hayden who is now the

621
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:58,450
commander of the u.s. strat comm said I

622
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,640
see a top tier cyber threat being Russia

623
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,919
and China in particular because they

624
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,470
have the ability to threaten the

625
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,419
existence of this nation so you can see

626
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,610
there is a very clear understanding that

627
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:13,779
cyber could become a major risk to the

628
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,279
nuclear weapon system in the u.s. now in

629
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:17,649
France the situation is a bit different

630
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:22,090
and that's why I put this as the second

631
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:24,639
example as I as I know from a few French

632
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,039
researchers and officials there is no

633
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,220
public debate and even the recent cyber

634
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,860
strategy from 28 he does not address the

635
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,250
cyber nuclear Nexus directly rather

636
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,229
indirectly but as far as I learn despite

637
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,140
that there is no political and public

638
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:44,260
debate military staff and government

639
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,169
officials on the top levels are indeed

640
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,120
aware of the threat but in France like

641
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:52,330
you probably know the general attitude

642
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,330
is not to talk to

643
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,699
about nuclear weapons in in general and

644
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,559
so it is the case with the

645
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:04,000
vulnerabilities but indeed France faced

646
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:06,549
also some crucial cyberattacks the first

647
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,340
one was in 2009 where the marine

648
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,620
Nacional was exposed to to a cyber

649
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,070
attack which was called the configure

650
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,080
warm and it struck important systems

651
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,000
preventing operative units to to

652
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,460
download their flight plans because

653
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,250
databases were infected and another

654
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,769
example is that a French nuclear company

655
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:34,840
called Aviva has been targeted by a

656
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:38,710
cyber espionage campaign back in 2011 so

657
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:41,860
now - - coming coming to the last part

658
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,720
of my presentation and talking about

659
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,969
what what can be done to enhance

660
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,159
security and resilience within crucial

661
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,470
parts of the nuclear weapon system like

662
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,960
the nc3 and the supply chain I want to

663
00:29:50,470 --> 00:30:00,639
look at some policy recommendations in

664
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:03,639
this last section so given the

665
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:06,428
complexity of the threat and taking into

666
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:08,289
account that quite often we don't know

667
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,870
what we don't know as we heard earlier

668
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:13,649
we have to carefully look at some key

669
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:17,229
aspects before developing any measures

670
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:19,600
so first as long as we know that nuclear

671
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,210
weapons exist as and as long as they

672
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,519
serve as the primary security guarantees

673
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,950
of some states and alliances like NATO

674
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,480
the very threat of a major cyber attack

675
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,059
can never be ruled out

676
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,130
and because systems tend to be

677
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,710
modernized and get increasingly

678
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,600
sophisticated and complex they tend to

679
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,720
be more vulnerable in the future

680
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,269
and second the threat of a cyber attack

681
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,460
against any nuclear weapon system is

682
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,500
always global it's it's never just at

683
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,539
the national perspective and therefore

684
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,000
any effective measure has to be taken on

685
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:55,690
a bilateral or even on a multilateral

686
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,909
basis and third cross sector exchange

687
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,370
and sharing of information is of crucial

688
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:02,860
importance this includes government's

689
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:05,739
the military leaders the private sector

690
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,169
but also academia think tanks in

691
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,630
national institution like the UN and

692
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,340
civil society because civil society

693
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:17,260
could bring the topic to their

694
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:20,290
respective governments now looking at a

695
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:23,620
couple of concrete steps and here again

696
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,809
this is just some recommendations some

697
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:31,629
possible messer measures and not an

698
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:34,178
exhaustive list first I think especially

699
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:37,929
when we look at NATO as an alliance we

700
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:39,820
need to develop a common few and first

701
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,220
interpretation of what actually is the

702
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,830
threat and we need to formulate an

703
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:48,210
appropriate political or military

704
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:51,460
response visa be a possible cyberattack

705
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,260
nation's national national States Percy

706
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,750
must develop a narrative why

707
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,090
cybersecurity is crucial for their

708
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,890
nuclear weapons systems and they should

709
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,020
refrain from thinking that a mayor

710
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,920
attack on their nuclear weapons system

711
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:08,590
is not possible and we need to have

712
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,500
something like a permanent cyber nuclear

713
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,510
task force which is made up of senior

714
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,660
military leaders government officials

715
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:20,170
and top level experts coming either from

716
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:22,720
or both from the nuclear policy and from

717
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:25,030
the cybersecurity side to to share

718
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,000
information to exchange views and to

719
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:30,879
develop as practice models and of course

720
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,250
as we face a major crisis now we need to

721
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,610
have bilateral measures between the US

722
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,620
and Russia because for because evidently

723
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,510
they are the biggest nuclear weapons

724
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,189
processors we need to keep open

725
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,620
communications channels are

726
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,840
re-established them we need to seek for

727
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,120
mutual understanding and an exchange of

728
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,659
views on cyber related nuclear threats

729
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,219
here and also more this is done very 8

730
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,900
that that's a very sensitive and

731
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,490
difficult area but we need more

732
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,160
transparency on cyber vulnerabilities

733
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,140
and nuclear weapon systems in general so

734
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,580
this is for example important when we

735
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,450
look at a NATO nuclear sharing

736
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:10,240
arrangements in Europe and on u.s.

737
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,850
nuclear modernization plants and to to

738
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,309
illuminate this a bit I put in another

739
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,709
slide slide about a NATO nuclear sharing

740
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:19,629
in Europe because here you can see

741
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,429
clearly that we have three distinct

742
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,460
entities first you have the nature

743
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:27,610
command and control we're 29 countries

744
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:30,220
have a say then we have US nuclear

745
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:34,090
weapons and five European countries and

746
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:37,149
you can see I put in this little picture

747
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,459
of the the modernization plan of the b61

748
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:42,610
bomb so in the future we will have to be

749
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:46,600
61 12 model which is basically a

750
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:48,639
combination of for existing b61 bombs

751
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,639
and this will be a very sophisticated

752
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,909
and complex model so as we already know

753
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,640
the more complex the system get the more

754
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:59,919
vulnerable it is and last we have

755
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,380
national aircraft and for European

756
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,179
states which is Germany Belgium the

757
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:10,990
Netherlands and Italy turkey doesn't

758
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:14,668
possess dual capable aircraft so coming

759
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:17,500
to some very final recommendations

760
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,569
private firms we heard that this is a

761
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,609
very crucial factors must provide

762
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,560
information to their respective national

763
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:26,080
authorities and also to research

764
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,270
institution about possible hacks and

765
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,060
vulnerabilities in order to to improve

766
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:33,460
supply chain security and resilience in

767
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:36,369
the future we absolutely need you to

768
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:40,030
establish better education and training

769
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:42,460
for military staff at any level and

770
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:45,089
since I'm coming from the academic side

771
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,339
I think that more master's and PhD

772
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:50,500
programs should focus on a cyber nuclear

773
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:53,320
Nexus because we certainly lack of

774
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,149
knowledge here especially among younger

775
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,030
people and we need a better exchange

776
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:00,430
between university research and military

777
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,550
institutions and finally we need to

778
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:05,799
establish additional program projects

779
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:10,630
and programs with an institution like

780
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:13,030
the u & u CBRN Centers of Excellence and

781
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:17,680
like and new institutional structures

782
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:19,810
focusing on a cyber nuclear threat so if

783
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,960
you are further interested in a topic

784
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:25,930
and unfortunately there are to date few

785
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,320
researchers who focus exactly on that I

786
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:31,109
can recommend this

787
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,940
excellent publications and refer to the

788
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,650
first one for example is a dear

789
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,920
colleague of mine and she has done

790
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,450
incredible research in this area and

791
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:44,130
also the Chatham House and the anti

792
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:46,980
publications are worth reading so last

793
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,100
but not least thank you for for your

794
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,390
attention and there's no Q&A session due

795
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,589
to time limits but if you want to to

796
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,390
talk about this please feel free to

797
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:01,620
approach me and we can talk about this

798
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:06,529
on a bilateral basis thank you

799
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,529
[Applause]
