1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:15,419
Hey Ohio's like math watashi wa 300's

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:20,100
watashi wa Michiko correctly masta and

3
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:22,650
that's all the Japanese I know thank you

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,070
very much for being here I'm very

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,470
excited here in Japan this is my second

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,840
time here it's an amazing country and

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,110
amazing culture and this is my first

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,540
time in this stage I am very excited

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:40,350
today we're going to talk about trading

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,629
technologies as I said before I'm from

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,060
Mexico I work for the company I owe

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:49,320
active what I do research and consulting

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,710
and my financial background is soft out

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,720
and I also bridgid this with

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,670
cybersecurity because I'm interested in

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,320
both topics and this is the presentation

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,760
of today this is the agenda I will give

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,339
you a basic introduction on the

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,670
financial markets on trading software

20
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,990
and then the core of the talk Bordner

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,940
abilities that I found followed by

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,399
responsible disclosure and other

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,350
interesting stuff such as for their

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,920
research that I will suggest you and

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,009
some conclusions and recommendations

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,200
alright this is how Wall Street and the

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,220
rest of the stock exchanges looked like

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:37,170
a couple of decades ago we passed from

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,110
this to this more computers less people

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,630
because is this faster is cheaper

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,830
however there are some risks involved

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:50,310
right now whenever a company needs

33
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,110
funding needs money they can go either

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,350
with private investors or they can go to

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,110
the stock market and they are traded

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,548
with different as different symbols we

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,850
can see here Apple Amazon Visa Ferrari

38
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,640
etc now these companies are traded in

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,099
stock exchanges that are like routers

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,369
like switches you can buy and sell

41
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,780
securities let's say stocks it

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:21,569
yes and many other financial instruments

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,940
it's important to distinguish the

44
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:27,958
differences between stock exchanges and

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,670
common banking networks in common

46
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,840
banking Network we have a centralized

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,659
entity right the financial institution

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,540
and in the exchange markets we have a

49
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,840
distributed ledger so there is registry

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,170
of who sold what and to whom who owns

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,340
what securities how many stocks are

52
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,920
people sought from here to here to here

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,349
having say that it's important to know

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,290
that the valuable information as well as

55
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,328
the attack surface and the betters are

56
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,120
different from banking applications

57
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,980
there are from the same sector but we

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,609
will see some slightly differences

59
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,730
between these now let's talk about

60
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,450
trading trading software with your

61
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,328
trading software you can buy securities

62
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:21,179
you can buy stocks ETFs and many other

63
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:23,639
instruments you can monitor your cash

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,750
balances how much money do you have how

65
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,000
much money do you lend to the broker and

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,709
also you can monitor your performance

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,200
how well you're doing on the stock

68
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:38,040
exchange how much money you're earning

69
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,959
or losing plus you can do market

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,179
research create alerts have real-time

71
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,099
news and broadcast and many other things

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,049
advanced charting etc hence the

73
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,260
sensitive data that I show you before

74
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,419
must be secret and must be known only by

75
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,319
you by the owner of your things

76
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:04,230
I wouldn't like other people to know how

77
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,030
much money I have invested right how

78
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,060
many positions I have on Tesla how many

79
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,810
positions I have on on Amazon etc now

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,620
let's see some of the most a famous

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:20,250
applications in the US and in Latin

82
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:23,729
America some of the big names are for

83
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,950
example TD Ameritrade Charles Schwab the

84
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,349
who finance as well the who finance is

85
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,620
to be in the past only for

86
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,960
market research only for market data but

87
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,930
nowadays you can link your brokerage

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,969
account into Yahoo Finance so you can

89
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,300
keep monitoring your performance in

90
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,580
these applications and you can see big

91
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,840
numbers in here many users using these

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:52,320
applications coinbase for

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,150
cryptocurrencies markets.com Bloomberg

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,730
terminal which is very expensive is a

95
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,679
paid terminal and a paid service it's

96
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,780
very expensive

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,390
this is very famous in Spain and in

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,969
Latin America and you can see millions

99
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,849
and hundreds of thousands of people

100
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:15,120
using these applications oh and uh for

101
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:18,950
foreign exchange etc now my research

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,690
what I did what I did basically is a

103
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,820
statistical analysis this is not nothing

104
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,580
new this is not not something

105
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,930
cybersecurity Budhu this is something we

106
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:35,520
all know already and great it is a basic

107
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,130
analysis on some of the most used and

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,250
well-known trading software that

109
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:45,780
includes 16 desktop apps 34 mobile apps

110
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:50,240
and three websites that encompasses this

111
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:53,520
list of 40 brokers there are many

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,900
well-known brokers such as finance

113
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:03,390
BitFenix Bloomberg charge swap conveys

114
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:08,549
is signal etrade ETX capital fidelity

115
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:11,010
first-rate the Mexican stock market iq

116
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,470
option cracking Merrill edge which is a

117
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,680
mix between Merrill Lynch and the Bank

118
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,680
of America

119
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:24,960
Wanda plus 500 probably hood squat rated

120
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:28,140
Emory rate and Yahoo Finance I didn't

121
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,739
taste any of the Japanese or Asian

122
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,419
brokers that's a homework for you guys

123
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,050
after you see some screenshots at Rice

124
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,240
I'll show you a I didn't touch any of

125
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,850
the software from from this part of the

126
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,349
world so I'm not sure how good or how

127
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,449
bad

128
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:49,409
let's say Tokyo Stock Exchange and

129
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:52,740
whatnot right all right my analysis I

130
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:58,259
used a Windows 7 and a Windows 10

131
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:01,169
computer a iOS on an iPhone 6 and the

132
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:05,699
Android emulator and what I checked on

133
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:08,039
all these applications was were these

134
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,529
security controls which are basic

135
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,620
controls or this is only the tip of the

136
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:15,779
iceberg only basic controls switches how

137
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,270
good is the Authenticator authentication

138
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:23,069
do the applique do the application

139
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:26,008
support to FA for example are there they

140
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:29,039
is storing my information encrypted in

141
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,589
the phone or in the computer basic

142
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,930
things like that around a website the

143
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:38,099
common stuff cross-site scripting

144
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:41,819
clickjacking security headers encryption

145
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:46,229
password policies automatic log out and

146
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:48,120
lock out root detections for mobile etc

147
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,300
as you can see this is very basic right

148
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:55,649
now

149
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:58,409
the result unfortunately in this part of

150
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,009
the finance industry we are still in

151
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:04,349
diapers

152
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:06,959
there is a long way to go to have mature

153
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,240
technologies in this area if you compare

154
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,039
these results against banking

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,770
applications you can see a big

156
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,649
difference and honestly I don't know why

157
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,899
it's happening I don't know why these

158
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:21,240
applications are less secure than the

159
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,599
retail banking apps even if they are

160
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,349
from the same financial institution no

161
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:31,080
idea in the following content the

162
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:33,990
screenshots and demos we will see a

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,630
strong evidence of why we need to

164
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,669
improve this ok

165
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:46,079
the biggest concern encryption

166
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:47,910
encryption in communications 64 percent

167
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,939
of the desktop applications they have

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,569
either partial or full unencrypted

169
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:55,649
communications what is the risk of this

170
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:57,599
imagine the recent attacker in the same

171
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,150
coffee shop

172
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,690
from what the trader is the attacker

173
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,790
could intercept and modify data let's

174
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,220
imagine a basic example of an attack

175
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,870
changed the prices the bid and ask

176
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:16,020
prices of a security so the trader would

177
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,140
be buying or selling based on misleading

178
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,710
on from information or the classic stuff

179
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,240
you know sniffing your information the

180
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,220
attacker would be able to see how much

181
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,130
money you have invested how much money

182
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,430
you are buying or selling from certain

183
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:36,060
securities most of the requests come

184
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:39,060
come in the HTTP form and there are

185
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,750
other many other protocols for the

186
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,560
financial industry such as fixed and of

187
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:51,860
course their proprietary software right

188
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:56,010
let's see this an app this is basic HTTP

189
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,860
you can see here create order from your

190
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:05,130
account with this pair of securities how

191
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:08,340
much money etc this is plaintext this is

192
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:11,490
another application this application

193
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:17,670
which is a desktop application sent to a

194
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:22,500
third-party provider their own API login

195
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:24,839
tokens so anyone like me or you can take

196
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,380
this URL put it in your browser and

197
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,870
hijack the session of the broker that's

198
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,790
easy right this is nothing sophisticated

199
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,180
there is nobody doing it it's just a

200
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:41,370
basic Wireshark screen capturing packets

201
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:45,300
this one is interesting this is a signal

202
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:49,310
a signal is a signal provider as you

203
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:52,319
know the guys who have the information

204
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,689
as quick as possible or the guys who do

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,910
the best profit from it the best trades

206
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:01,140
as soon as you go into the market the

207
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,990
more profit you get this company push

208
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,180
you signals to your market obligation

209
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,790
and it's a paid service you pay for

210
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,229
information right they give you an

211
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,849
initial name and a password

212
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,690
but in this application which is the

213
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,550
broker which is the server a TCP server

214
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,920
you can see my username and my password

215
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,949
in clear-text

216
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:27,030
interestingly I could so I could see the

217
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,430
copyright from 99 how is that possible

218
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,610
that 10 20 years later we are still

219
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,260
using software from the from 99 can you

220
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,170
imagine that I think the legacy software

221
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,480
of course I went to the ACC to see some

222
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,370
archives etc and I found out that this

223
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,690
company was acquired by another company

224
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,880
and probably this is why they are

225
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,510
carrying this very old software without

226
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,260
security this is another application FX

227
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:57,630
pro for foreign exchange you have your

228
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,170
price connection and your trade endpoint

229
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,170
and in the endpoint you have the port

230
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,219
with SSL but if you prefer you can use

231
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,290
plain text why not

232
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:14,450
let's see a demonstration video on

233
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:18,420
Interactive Brokers I bought which is a

234
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:22,260
is a robot assistant so you can send

235
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,089
orders to this robot and the information

236
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,160
goes over fix which is financial

237
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,160
information exchange protocol

238
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:47,420
this is the application price of Netflix

239
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:50,509
I sent a comment the application

240
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:55,339
detected my voice and send me the price

241
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:57,999
of Netflix buy 100 shares of Netflix at

242
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,999
market price

243
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:17,560
submit order finally I I buy the

244
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:21,540
security the rest of the application

245
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:24,219
goes encrypted over HTTPS is secure

246
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,370
except from these new features this is

247
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:34,750
another problem small features that are

248
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:39,100
not secured this is where shark you can

249
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:45,040
see the basic fix decoder and when I

250
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:52,360
follow the TCP stream you can clearly

251
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:55,120
see the user input these so if I ask for

252
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,060
my you know my positions how much money

253
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,780
do I have my balances etc everything is

254
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,410
here

255
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:05,500
partially unencrypted so let's be

256
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,630
careful with things like this your

257
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,240
application could be very secure but if

258
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:16,560
you're not protecting small pieces like

259
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:25,000
this then who knows

260
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:27,880
ok here my positions clear text this

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,940
application is interesting they have

262
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,380
this SSL button at the login screen

263
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,850
disabled by default by the way and we

264
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,630
have two problems here but the first

265
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,750
problem is we all know what SSL means

266
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:47,710
right we are tech-savvy we understand

267
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,570
that but what about the finance years

268
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,690
what about people who have no idea what

269
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,760
SSL means they might think ok if this is

270
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,010
by default disable and I have no idea

271
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,860
what it is of course I won't touch it I

272
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:04,660
want to trade I don't care what SSL is

273
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:08,620
right so the second problem is even when

274
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,490
when SSL is enabled the application is

275
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,490
secure the communication is encrypted

276
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:18,769
however there is a log file with all my

277
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:23,439
balances with all the positions etc

278
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:26,779
that is being sent in clear-text

279
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:28,998
all this is in clear text all you need

280
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:30,829
is to capture this packet over HTTP and

281
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:34,220
you can see all the information but your

282
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:38,628
balances your positions etc now let's

283
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:42,019
see this one this is a watchlist clear

284
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:44,209
text everywhere this is another one this

285
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:47,059
is similar to the previous one where all

286
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:50,388
the communication is secured over HTTPS

287
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:54,649
but one developer forgot to remove a

288
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:57,679
duplicate request over HTTP one request

289
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:01,549
was enough to capture the session token

290
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:05,360
and only this value is all you need to

291
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:07,509
hijack the session now another

292
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,439
interesting problem is denial of service

293
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,389
availability is one of the most

294
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:14,629
important assets when it comes to

295
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:18,410
trading if your application is not ready

296
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:21,199
you could lose trading opportunities

297
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:25,519
right you need to have your application

298
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:28,969
right in time to submit orders but there

299
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,399
are problems that we are is still

300
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,619
committing from the 90s this is very

301
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:38,089
nineties when it comes to TCP sockets

302
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:41,179
many applications they are not limiting

303
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:44,629
the number of connections on the TCP

304
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:46,970
servers what you can do is just create

305
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:50,720
many connections and you will exhaust

306
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,549
the memory and other resources let's see

307
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,490
a couple of demos the first one will be

308
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:59,749
TD Ameritrade thinkorswim

309
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:04,899
the tcp orders server that change the

310
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:04,899
different security problems we'll see

311
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:13,240
okay

312
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:17,159
this is the application I go to the

313
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:22,299
configuration and you can see the TCP

314
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:27,819
orders port number so whenever I connect

315
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:31,059
I get this error come and not recognize

316
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:33,940
is their own protocol right so what I

317
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:39,009
did I've reversed the application which

318
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:42,519
is with a java application and i started

319
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:45,789
to follow that error message and when I

320
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:53,619
found a syntax error message I continue

321
00:17:45,789 --> 00:18:00,309
until I found the parser so you can see

322
00:17:53,619 --> 00:18:04,689
clearly some some of the grammar how the

323
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:11,678
syntax is parse it and in the end I was

324
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:15,820
able able to to create a ballot message

325
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,230
for this so you can send orders now the

326
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,320
problem is there is no limit of

327
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:24,929
connections so I created this small

328
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,249
program that I call order pop-up attack

329
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,769
because whenever there is an order sent

330
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:32,860
there is a pop-up and the application is

331
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:35,909
frozen until that pop-up is click OK or

332
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,908
cancel right

333
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:46,529
this is the trainer using the

334
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:51,509
application and whenever I execute the

335
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:55,830
attack you can see the orders here they

336
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:59,929
pop up and the trader can cannot do

337
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:04,049
anything until you close that pop-up

338
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:05,879
secondly for some reason this small

339
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,039
attack triggered and null pointer

340
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:13,439
dereference in the application it's

341
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:20,190
crashed now so basically the application

342
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:25,349
rendered useless now after I stop the

343
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:28,979
attack you can see that when this

344
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:32,939
application crashed the error could be

345
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:36,809
sent to the developers and the third

346
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:41,159
problem is that in this report there is

347
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:44,309
a screenshot of my main application the

348
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,649
screen zero and the third problem is

349
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:50,129
this could be a privacy concern because

350
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:53,070
in this screenshot I'm showing how much

351
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:55,978
money do I have etcetera and could be

352
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,539
sent to the developers do developers

353
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:59,700
really need to know how much money do I

354
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:07,619
have in my account to fix a null pointer

355
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:11,159
dereference I don't think so now a

356
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:15,539
different another example of a denial of

357
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:20,609
services is signal we have the TCP

358
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:23,090
servers here listening this is a basic

359
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:27,449
HTML file a malicious file that will

360
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,209
load every very often and send another

361
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,669
request to the localhost so imagine a

362
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:37,070
phishing attack sent to the trader the

363
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:40,409
trader clicks on the malicious link and

364
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,549
do you really know what's happening

365
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:45,690
while you're reading this

366
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:48,379
well you're trading applications is

367
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,379
going to crash

368
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,810
so after the application crashes there

369
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,469
is no more signal and the rest of the

370
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:59,860
application is connected to this signal

371
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,110
provider or are gone

372
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,939
you cannot trade anymore the plug-in

373
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,879
disconnected this is basic concept of

374
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,430
denial of service right so you're not

375
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,590
sure to believe if you have to buy or to

376
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:23,650
sell securities because your application

377
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:27,070
is gone some basic memory leak what

378
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,750
should be done basic things control the

379
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,919
maximum number of connections set

380
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:36,670
timeout and the throw pulled seconds or

381
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,770
minutes between orders now let's move on

382
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,350
to another interesting thing that is not

383
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:46,150
a book it's not a burner abilities it's

384
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:48,580
a feature for real there are trading

385
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,670
languages supported in the most of civic

386
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,699
sophisticated tools that allow you to

387
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,830
create to develop your own expert

388
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,410
advisors which are trading robots your

389
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,820
own indicators and more advanced at

390
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:07,180
trading right the problem is that many

391
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,210
of these languages are on the top of

392
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:14,500
other languages such as C++ C sharp

393
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:18,640
Pascal and as you know some allow DLL

394
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:24,010
import right in some of these

395
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,470
applications they allow the import some

396
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:30,510
others restrict that some others warn

397
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:34,740
you about the DLL import they tell you a

398
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:37,360
this could be dangerous but

399
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,780
interestingly when you go to the

400
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,929
internet internet and look for tutorials

401
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,280
on how to implement trading robots all

402
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,430
the people wants money all the people

403
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,440
wants to get rich overnight

404
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,750
you see these tutorials step by step

405
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,680
click here click next install the robot

406
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:59,290
click the DLL imports and again we

407
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,090
understand the risk of this but people

408
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,470
finance here who have no idea what that

409
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,780
DLL is

410
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,690
well if the tutorial is telling me to

411
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:11,080
enable this I will

412
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:13,150
the risks are common execution malicious

413
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,159
plug-ins from the internet there are

414
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,220
thousands of them in forums in trading

415
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,950
forums for different platforms

416
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,780
this is a basic calc not EXCI or let's

417
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,400
see a more sophisticated demo a more

418
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,649
realistic demo this is not think

419
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,010
sophisticated honestly this is something

420
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,440
basic you will see this is a backdoor

421
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,950
for meta trader which is one of the most

422
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:40,330
famous platforms these guys as an eg

423
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:47,590
moku indicator we just far as I remember

424
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:51,970
this is a Japanese indicator so we have

425
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:54,970
here my graphs and this is the

426
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,980
development language this is the

427
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,750
indicator that I created this is

428
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:04,780
Ichimoku cloud here i importing the

429
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:13,270
Ichimoku cloud library shell shell 3 to

430
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:18,460
the DLL on initialization I will draw

431
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:21,910
the cloud executing these commands third

432
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:25,680
util will download these which is a

433
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,680
base64 program

434
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:45,880
okay then I will decode the cloud and

435
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:49,470
finally I will execute or draw the Det

436
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,590
McLeod after I compile the plug-in I

437
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:58,150
have my graph here I have my indicators

438
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:03,760
I will put this eg moku indicator into

439
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:08,050
this graph I drag it here this is the

440
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:12,460
configuration and the dependencies allow

441
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:17,639
the other imports if I click OK you can

442
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,640
see the cloud but what's happening

443
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:30,399
behind I connect and reserve basic back

444
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:34,540
door in this indicator so as you could

445
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,980
see there was a warning but this was the

446
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:47,100
only application that showed me that

447
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:53,160
warning now let's move on to more

448
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,159
interesting stuff passwords on encrypted

449
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,720
in 21% of the moral apps and desktop

450
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,220
apps the password was a storeroom

451
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,060
encrypted there are different ways to

452
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:06,310
extract this information right either

453
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,990
from the file system or the login

454
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:12,190
console in Android with other way low

455
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:14,980
cut or in iOS just like again checking

456
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,620
the console locks and the realtek

457
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,930
scenario would be whenever you have the

458
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:23,199
password you login into the trading

459
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:27,790
application on the on web do you link a

460
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:31,150
new bank account you sell all the stocks

461
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:33,670
do you transfer the fiat money and you

462
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,820
remove the link that's easy right we

463
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:40,990
have another related problem here

464
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,550
whenever you add a bank account the

465
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,120
applications asks you to put your

466
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,020
password not two-factor authentication

467
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,790
so what is the purpose

468
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,910
if you have the puzzle ready you can add

469
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:55,690
a new bank account and in many cases

470
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,090
when the application supports two-factor

471
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,550
authentication they do not ask for that

472
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:04,949
when you add a bank account I think it's

473
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:08,350
important to add this extra step in here

474
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,990
let's see ETX capital we have two

475
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,820
problems here first they are sending the

476
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,180
passwords in clear-text into the log

477
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:18,610
file and the second problem is you never

478
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:22,180
put sensitive information in a gate

479
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,250
parameter because as you know infinite

480
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:30,610
parameters are the story in locks in

481
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:35,290
proxies etc let's see this one user

482
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:39,699
password plaintext here so that means

483
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:42,250
that a developer explicitly put this

484
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,890
information here they know that this is

485
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,720
stored in clear text let's see another

486
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,890
one

487
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,560
whenever you change the password in this

488
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:57,360
one the new password is stored in log

489
00:27:50,560 --> 00:28:03,250
files this is another one clear text

490
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:07,270
base64 is not encryption still they are

491
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:14,380
encrypting strongly the password here to

492
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:15,850
work for coinbase not the password but

493
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,340
when you enable two-factor

494
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,389
authentication they extract not not

495
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,449
two-factor authentication

496
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,360
sorry the pin to unlock the application

497
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:29,800
well this pin is in plaintext we have

498
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:34,479
another application here and another one

499
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:37,120
I reported this one in 2017 this is a

500
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,980
clear text password I changed the

501
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,060
password to one two three four five six

502
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:45,790
eight months later this year i retested

503
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,710
the application and yes certainly they

504
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,720
have fixed this vulnerability here the

505
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,230
password is encrypted but in another

506
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,990
file whenever you enable two-factor

507
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,640
authentication to be more secure for

508
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,130
some reason they are opening again the

509
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,560
previous window they are storing to step

510
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,090
out pass

511
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:08,050
you're fixing one side and you're

512
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:12,189
leaving another door open now related to

513
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:15,220
password trading data imagine a

514
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,720
malicious user obtaining how much money

515
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,070
do you have invested I don't know I

516
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,840
don't know there could be endless

517
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,929
possibilities right that I'm malicious

518
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,300
guy can do knowing that you're a rich

519
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:29,710
person or or I don't know right

520
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,260
all this information should be known

521
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,640
only by you your positions your personal

522
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,610
data your watchlist

523
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,340
the balances the portfolio imagine the

524
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,620
seasoned investors that are quoting

525
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:45,820
symbols because they know something they

526
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:48,879
are experts right if you see that

527
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,439
certain people is a this guy who is

528
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,810
doing a lot of money on trading it's

529
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,910
looking often for this and this symbol

530
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,700
that means something's probably he's

531
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,590
waiting to buy stocks in the next days

532
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,760
or in the next minute so this should be

533
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:06,010
secret this is sensitive still we are

534
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,490
finding all this information in

535
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:12,250
clear-text Shiseido for example which is

536
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,740
a Japanese company right by the way this

537
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,290
is one of my favorite stocks I I have a

538
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:25,720
few of them a few stocks it's a really

539
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:27,580
good company Yahoo Finance do you have

540
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,860
everything in a JSON file yahoo finance

541
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:34,149
and we work together and they'll fix it

542
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:40,740
another one personal information

543
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:40,740
balances symbols everywhere my address

544
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,610
credit card information my name to your

545
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:58,770
text everywhere orders with a fancy

546
00:30:48,610 --> 00:31:01,379
ascii art in a log file symbols prices

547
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,590
etc

548
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:10,260
now related to password weak password

549
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:15,780
policies we can see brokers just plus

550
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:18,629
500 or Metatrader that they allow users

551
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,360
to have one two three four five as

552
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:24,299
password and there are some others that

553
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,850
they do not allow you to have complex

554
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:30,150
passwords just this one the password you

555
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,199
enter is too long please choose a

556
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:36,299
shorter password less than 12 characters

557
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,890
why is that seriously is that a

558
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,889
limitation in the database or what

559
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,379
authentication problems most web

560
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,970
applications implement two-factor

561
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,860
authentication but it's not enabled by

562
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,980
default in my opinion they should

563
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:56,000
encourage they should try to enforce try

564
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,070
to push people to wait please enable 2fa

565
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,100
at least for adding a new bank account

566
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:05,330
for example or to sell or to buy a

567
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,740
certain amount of money on the market

568
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,090
most desktop applications of course they

569
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,880
do not implement two-factor

570
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:16,500
authentication even when the version for

571
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,120
web is implemented and most mobile

572
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,710
phones nowadays they support the

573
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:26,510
fingerprint reader however one quarter

574
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:30,570
of the applications 25% do not implement

575
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:33,809
fingerprint authentication another

576
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:36,600
prevalent problem try so session is

577
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:38,610
still valid in server side after logout

578
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,100
this is a very common problem and I saw

579
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,918
this in big names which has a trade swap

580
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,350
fidelity Yahoo Finance you click the

581
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,350
logout button your browser appears that

582
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,209
you're logged out but the session that I

583
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:56,370
authenticate you authenticate yourself

584
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:59,309
with the server is still valid I'm

585
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:02,239
locked out from Yahoo Finance and this

586
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:05,010
is a previously captured request I

587
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,370
resent it with burp and I got

588
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:12,299
information with the trade same thing

589
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:14,729
with charge Schwab same thing the

590
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:18,250
session cookie was still valid

591
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:21,250
and that's easy to fix I think another

592
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,809
thing HTTP headers nowadays every

593
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,250
guideline everything tells you a use

594
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:29,200
these basic sets of headers this is

595
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:33,009
something from from the kindergarten we

596
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,620
all know that still 50% of the

597
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:40,950
applications do not implement the basic

598
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:44,049
flags and 70% for cookies and 70% of

599
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,850
them do not implement the other ones

600
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:49,918
which has a strict Transport Security or

601
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:52,658
CSP or x-frame options and whatnot

602
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,120
another interesting thing privacy mode I

603
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:57,340
can shoulder surfing attacks some

604
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,039
applications implemented before and

605
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,809
after enabling the privacy mode Yahoo

606
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,809
Finance enabled it but most of the

607
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:09,009
applications don't I'm going to go

608
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:12,389
faster I'm running out of time recorded

609
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:15,040
secrets developers love to leave traces

610
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:16,869
for example Merrill edge is a good one

611
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,040
you can see that the application is

612
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:23,470
obfuscated nevertheless the rest of the

613
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,679
applications are not enforcing it

614
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:30,730
properly you can see when third party

615
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,918
service providers passwords and in many

616
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:37,030
applications they leave traces of their

617
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:42,250
internal environment internal course

618
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:45,790
names private keys host names internal

619
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:49,060
IP addresses etc when it comes to

620
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:51,849
desktop applications we have no idea

621
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:55,629
what the exploitation make mitigations

622
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:58,480
are none of the applications most of the

623
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:01,810
modules they do not have a SLR dip or

624
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,579
cannery implemented here everything is

625
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,319
false

626
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:09,609
even from the DLLs or excel files that

627
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:11,910
listen on on TCP sockets the same for

628
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,910
Linux

629
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:22,270
certificate validation 32% do not

630
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:25,349
validate and if they do they ask you and

631
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:29,470
they allow you to accept the certificate

632
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:31,300
group detection almost 80% do not detect

633
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,419
it and the ones who detect it they just

634
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,359
warn you about the risks but you can use

635
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,800
their application the classic ones

636
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,359
cross-site scripting for web

637
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,339
applications and this is only a bit of

638
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,690
all the stuff I found on different

639
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:51,849
applications you can go here to read the

640
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,670
wall the white paper you can see there

641
00:35:51,849 --> 00:36:00,750
are more statistics more screenshots and

642
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:03,369
more problems more vulnerabilities now

643
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:06,730
another problem a high-level program

644
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:12,339
this responsible disclosure we reported

645
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:17,010
this to 20 brokers in September last

646
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:20,740
year and this year this big list and

647
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:25,900
only a few of them replied our email

648
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:30,609
with the reported vulnerabilities some

649
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:34,780
of them told us that the contact email

650
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:38,529
which is a basic contact at company comm

651
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:41,560
is unmonitored this is a big problem

652
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,240
because when you are reporting security

653
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,279
vulnerabilities not only on trading

654
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,560
platforms trend in anything if you do

655
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,480
not monitor these kind of emails you can

656
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,490
lose things like this right this is a

657
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,300
this is an old problem here there is not

658
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:58,180
a right channel to address security

659
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:01,420
issues the big guys are the ones that

660
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,779
work closer to us so we can we could

661
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,670
help together to fix their issues the

662
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,500
big names you know TD Ameritrade who

663
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:12,849
have the whole finance Interactive

664
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:17,170
Brokers they replied or emails one or

665
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:22,690
two days after we sent a report and you

666
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:24,550
can clearly see this correlation between

667
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,550
the amount of money they invest in cyber

668
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,740
security and how they protect their cost

669
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,740
right you can see this the smallest

670
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,899
brokers they never they never receive

671
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:38,140
the email I'm sure they mail is there

672
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:40,330
somewhere they're lost and then they on

673
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,270
the digital debrief but they never they

674
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,790
never saw a report only the big names

675
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,040
they they invest more in cybersecurity

676
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:54,279
they they want to protect their customer

677
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:56,050
base now a I have other ideas but I

678
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,720
didn't have time to develop this ideas

679
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,970
so this is some ideas I had

680
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,930
so probably any of you want to expand

681
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,730
this area social trading risks nowadays

682
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,470
everything is connected on social media

683
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:12,190
on Twitter on Instagram even the stock

684
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:14,230
markets the NYC NASDAQ etc they are

685
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,080
sharing Instagram stories they're on

686
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:20,500
social media every day they're teaching

687
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:25,509
people what what is an IPO who is a new

688
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:27,190
IPO of the day etc and there are many

689
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,790
platforms that are implementing things

690
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:33,880
like copycat trading like following

691
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:37,210
traders like in Twitter so if a trader

692
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,470
is doing well you can copycat their

693
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:44,050
trade with your own money of course and

694
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:47,200
I think it's a nice interesting topic

695
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:50,770
for example in addition to fundamentals

696
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,710
and technicals analysis tools there is

697
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:58,450
something called sentiment analysis

698
00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:00,790
which is basically a measure of the

699
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,770
acceptance or rejection of certain

700
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,560
stocks by people for example this is my

701
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,660
platform this is V Ameritrade you have

702
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,610
the fundamentals and the the rest of the

703
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,310
information of the company here Nintendo

704
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,930
but if you go to social signals you can

705
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:17,350
see the social indicator here the

706
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:19,660
sentiment that means that 70 percent 73

707
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:23,049
percent of the people is talking

708
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,990
positively of such a stock and they are

709
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,800
talking more on pokémon a Nintendo and

710
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:32,140
the earth selecting certain tweets

711
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,920
selected so my idea is I don't know

712
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:38,049
where where it's coming from this

713
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,900
information is that an appliance doing

714
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,270
sentiment analysis or is just

715
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,600
a room with five guys looking on Twitter

716
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:51,340
I have no idea I try to bypass this you

717
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:53,710
know putting some fake information on

718
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,710
Twitter and it was not picked up in here

719
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,880
it never it never appeared so I think

720
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,220
this is an interesting topic because

721
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,760
with that if there is a flaw in that is

722
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:08,350
a way to bypass this you can influence

723
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,180
in the market data right another risk is

724
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,230
trading on misleading information for

725
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,819
example fake news

726
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:19,240
how would are we by selecting this fake

727
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:22,300
information wouldn't that be cool to

728
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,310
have your training application to in

729
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,090
your news feed to say eh

730
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,940
hold on warning this could be fake like

731
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:34,420
do not trade on these information

732
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:37,000
analyze twice before you do trade or

733
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:40,980
things like this confusion do you

734
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,900
remember the PGP flow this or last year

735
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,530
so funny listen there was there is a

736
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:52,060
company PIMCO love stock clause that

737
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:54,490
their stock symbol the ticker is PGP so

738
00:40:52,060 --> 00:41:00,790
when it came to social media attention

739
00:40:54,490 --> 00:41:03,339
PGP security flaw the price plunged of

740
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,890
this company and it has nothing to do

741
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,780
with with the PGP encryption software it

742
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:11,220
was a different thing but the stock

743
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,510
market reacts in a different way

744
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:17,319
five minutes later the people realize

745
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:20,770
hey hold on this is not my PGP let's buy

746
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:25,830
again and a lot of people did money here

747
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:29,830
on the beer there and bull market

748
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:33,790
another forty research today at all I

749
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:36,670
talk you about basic protocols HTTP and

750
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:39,940
fix but there are many protocols in the

751
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:43,120
different exchanges you can see the big

752
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,390
list have they been forced have they

753
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:50,850
been checked in terms of security I

754
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:54,000
don't know the regulator's they are

755
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:56,220
still giving basic guidance

756
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,859
even rating organizations you can see

757
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,709
they rate the different traders with the

758
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:04,259
stars the fees the platforms the the

759
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:08,010
education the research how easy is to

760
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,680
use I don't see a column for security

761
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,560
and I honestly there should be one here

762
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,899
at least you know the reviewers checking

763
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,849
if the application support to FA or

764
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,740
complex passwords basic things like that

765
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:24,990
and put some stars on it some accolades

766
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:27,259
recommendation for end-users enable all

767
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:31,040
the security mechanisms in your platform

768
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:33,240
for reference analyze your platforms

769
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,990
implement secure design and programming

770
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,109
and let third-party companies auditors

771
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,689
to audit your applications because it's

772
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:46,609
different the results are different with

773
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:50,089
people thinking outside of the box

774
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:53,910
conclusions trading applications are

775
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:56,819
less secure than banking apps for some

776
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:59,190
reason I don't know why yet cryptic

777
00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:01,319
changes have more security controls than

778
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:03,480
the average I think it's because of the

779
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,819
exposure on the internet on the Bitcoin

780
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,530
Bitcoin hype right all the people want

781
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:11,099
to hack the exchanges and get rich

782
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:13,020
overnight etc come for it for it for the

783
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:17,670
same reason they are implementing more

784
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,319
security and brokers nipple improve not

785
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,270
only there are trading applications the

786
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:24,270
front-end applications they also need to

787
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,130
secure the backend software the

788
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,319
protocols the software they implement I

789
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,180
have heard horror story from different

790
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,000
people working in the financial sector

791
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:37,940
that tells me the kind of software they

792
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,940
use back office in back office and

793
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:46,929
arigato gozai master thank you so much

794
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,929
[Applause]
