00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,179
hello everybody my name is Chaim Ben

2
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,560
sock choicelessly

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:18,900
my name is Hochul yeah I'm very old to

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,700
be a presentation here today our code

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,799
blue

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:27,150
we are morale analyst from Korea as a

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,660
secret research my main focus is the

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,140
secret instance death occurs in South

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,230
Korea interest rate some of the straight

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,489
actor step effect Korea targets other

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,589
countries as well including Japan the

12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,739
research into the straight correction

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,770
between Korea and Japan is one let let

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:56,819
me to stand here for the presentation

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:59,090
today first let's have a look at the

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,100
relationship between Korea and Japan

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,159
Korea and Japan is very close and

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,750
distanced the distance from Seoul Korea

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:13,020
is around 1,000 kilometers and it takes

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,619
about two hours maximum three hours by

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,920
frame the distance from to them which is

22
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,159
the city at the southern coast of Korea

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,770
and Sistema which is the island of Japan

24
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:31,460
is less than 100 kilometers the two

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,158
countries are not only close in distance

26
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,949
but have similarities in language the

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,250
language structure a clause regarding

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,150
world order angel similar pronunciation

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,970
of the word of Chinese origin it sound

30
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,939
similar to the point that I feel like I

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,780
can't understand some Japanese but you

32
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,779
know I really don't but it is much

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,020
easier for both countries to run the

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,700
ranges of each other

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,149
compared to learning on European

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,670
languages such as English for Koreans

37
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:14,010
and Japanese English is very difficult

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,519
language now let's have a brief look at

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,130
the

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,850
story of home computers in Korea in

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,370
Korea

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,480
their first blow for home computers

43
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,050
started in 1983 when the government

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,010
decided to introduce computer education

45
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,740
but at the time computers were expensive

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:38,190
and their post was too high for the

47
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,890
everything income of Korean family most

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,620
of the home computers sold by Korean

49
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:48,570
companies were based on the trumpeters

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,540
from US and UK and Japan or were clones

51
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,750
there were even some Japanese product

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:00,079
products made by companies like a shop

53
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,080
who sold their product directly in Korea

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:12,210
however by end of 1980s only Apple 2 and

55
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:16,320
MSX and IBM PC clones are wrapped in the

56
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:19,709
market from 1980 their computers were

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,859
unified into IBM PC come close for

58
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:28,140
models what I understand that mother's

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:32,700
such as an assist pc-9801 many pictured

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,920
until 2000 in Japan the first

61
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,250
comfortable spawned in Korea was the

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,160
brain virus Korean for most devoted a

63
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,510
program to detect and remove the virus

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,510
and one of them was vaccine now each

65
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,420
year back century also known as we 3

66
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,100
which is an advanced program still being

67
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,049
diverted by Anna my colleague also

68
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,459
created or antivirus program during the

69
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,340
high school all side note the comedy was

70
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,030
created in Korea was called the domani

71
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,900
yet is nominally a virus which was made

72
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:16,290
in 1990 dominating miss O'Neil in

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,760
Japanese and this word was used commonly

74
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:24,240
by my grandparents generation in Korea

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,729
you can see the dominant business there

76
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,890
is the point differences difference

77
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,979
between the IT in

78
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:35,610
in Korea and Japan but there are also

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,550
Pro there are also similarities such as

80
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,220
having a word processing program for the

81
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,760
countries or how the use of a domestic

82
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,280
service is partner however it is also

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,570
true that the two countries do not have

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,200
machi relevance to each other regarding

85
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,390
security and now the there is some

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,440
additional in warmth which several

87
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,370
duplicating pictures security threats

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,980
depending on the country

89
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,470
Benghazi and culture there is a

90
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,740
difference difference between malware

91
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:14,310
battle in Korea in Japan there are the

92
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,910
top 10 most stupid in Korea and Japan in

93
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:22,770
the same period and the list is based on

94
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:26,280
unless detection name but the two

95
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:30,930
countries have been to I began to have

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,719
some security issues in comma 1 Mario

97
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,010
developer who have been doing internet

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,190
banking information in Korea since 2011

99
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:44,340
started attacking Japan in 2014 this was

100
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,130
work I realized for the first time that

101
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:52,340
don't threat actors at the King Korea

102
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:55,980
worth attacking targets in Japan as well

103
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,700
there have also been cases where malware

104
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,700
creditors in South America attacks banks

105
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:06,120
and neighboring countries and they found

106
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:09,450
in relatively easy to access targets in

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,900
those regions because they used Spanish

108
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,719
this Mario developer was targeting two

109
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,659
countries at the same time where the

110
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,160
ranges and interpreting environment are

111
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:26,130
different and it was also interested to

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,280
find Chinese world in the malware found

113
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:33,060
in Korea which were developed it or

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,609
still into a banking information of

115
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,700
course we cannot blame any single

116
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,120
country to be responsible even once a

117
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,180
Korean criminals were suspected to be

118
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,060
behind the attack this is because there

119
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,360
there were actually cases where the

120
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:56,460
Koreans were called requesting or GRT

121
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,430
Chinese hacker the damage causes

122
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,560
violence on world in Korea was literally

123
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,010
low until 2014

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,370
but everything changes since 20 ppl

125
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:12,030
critter akka founded in 2015

126
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,610
somebody is the pure language is it not

127
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,960
only supported Korean for distributed

128
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,690
bar well throat well the old IT related

129
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,080
community website in Korea krutov also

130
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,960
supported Japanese it is common these

131
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,469
days to have display of ransom note in

132
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,780
various languages but it was rare from

133
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:38,660
my relatives supported any languages

134
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,659
languages other than English back then

135
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:52,990
for epitaxy we can see there were there

136
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,780
are more exempt of cases that involved

137
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,290
the two countries some straight actors

138
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:06,669
only operate in Korea or in Japan but

139
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:09,070
many of them target both countries first

140
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,500
I would like to talk to you about

141
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,380
destroyed actors that are active in

142
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,680
Korea many unknown entities have

143
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,380
continued to you of her career since 28

144
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,140
and this is an overview of straight

145
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,350
actors currently active this is only

146
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,289
April threat actors del attacked August

147
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:32,979
and does not include those involved in

148
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:35,740
online games internet banking and koi -

149
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:39,550
of course there are other groups that

150
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,220
have not been responded and I am

151
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:46,180
planning to add the recruits here if

152
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:48,880
there are more discovered the other

153
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,640
group is well known to be a subgroup of

154
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,620
the Rogers group and has been active

155
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,140
only in Korea since 20 a 2002 a even

156
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,460
before the first report of the Rogers

157
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:06,520
group appeared in 29 its target since 28

158
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,580
include the Korean military the past

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:13,720
companies and political organizations

160
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,690
but it adidas private companies in 2016

161
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,990
in the interest interest of the finest

162
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,990
game

163
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,480
the second group this group is called

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,200
Rogers or hidden Cobra I believe that

165
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,830
this girl code hidden Cobra is Earth's

166
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,260
released a little to Sony Pictures have

167
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:38,380
mister this group mainly uses email as a

168
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,950
method of infection L also uses the

169
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,340
method of infiltration and hacking or

170
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,410
web hosting company it has used attacks

171
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,200
which is poised various

172
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:54,219
zero-day vulnerabilities this group has

173
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,950
also Gaston government agencies major

174
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,150
companies and ice-t companies of Korea

175
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,520
and East

176
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,970
targeting the finance sector and

177
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,990
critical exchanges it is all staggered

178
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:10,390
countries understand South Korea

179
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,380
usually these two groups together are

180
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:17,080
called Rogers group however I personally

181
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,870
think that we need to separate them now

182
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,390
because they have different targets and

183
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,850
he brought attack measured and by Wells

184
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,400
I will also continue studying the

185
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,700
relationship and the process between

186
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:33,339
these two groups I talked about these

187
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,130
groups at Cahokia and by splitting

188
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,080
conference this year my slide can be

189
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,110
found on the Internet

190
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,350
we can see the sum of the spread groups

191
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:50,140
we touched upon today attacking Japan as

192
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:53,830
well or as well as Korea I spoke I spoke

193
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,740
was described by Kaspersky Lab in 2013

194
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,380
according to their report the main

195
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,110
attack targets are government agencies

196
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,380
and the defense industry in Korea in

197
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:09,130
Japan currently this model is not being

198
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:12,130
reported in Korea I was able to find

199
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,220
additional variant step is not mentioned

200
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:19,360
in the report from the sample report by

201
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:24,420
our client this iceberg and the period

202
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,420
continue unique philippi information I

203
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,330
spoke Elzy variant supports comments

204
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:35,160
institution using same did exe file

205
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:39,610
unload and download and street picture

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:42,790
who I spoke ng parents so c2 address are

207
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:48,760
similar to the website address that are

208
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:51,279
used in Korea very similar in October

209
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,430
2017 unless released the report on

210
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,640
operation will be scale operation PD

211
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,349
biscuit is also known as hot beat apt

212
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,930
and operation Olga

213
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:06,280
this group has been active in Korea for

214
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,920
around 10 years since 20 2009 although

215
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,990
they are mainly targets military

216
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,209
institutions and defense industry

217
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:18,500
they also attack other industries such

218
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:21,890
as ice tea and manufacturing this berry

219
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:28,060
threat group or tactic or heavy industry

220
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:32,180
company in Japan in 2011 their manuals

221
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:37,189
include strings such as business Biasi

222
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:39,979
and biology the search server addressed

223
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:43,550
and proton Rose existed by bar where are

224
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,370
usually completed by decoding the

225
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,870
including strings we can find the port

226
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:53,060
numbers and the CNC address a Japanese

227
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,730
journalist affair are two networks under

228
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,000
covered under attack of business this

229
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,950
year so and I arrived in Japan yesterday

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,840
I met him to express my gratitude and

231
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,350
disgusted about how we can collaborate

232
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,020
collaborate in the future it was all

233
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:15,170
text to you this blog that I was able to

234
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,689
run below about this the gross

235
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:21,849
additional attacks on their own

236
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:24,950
organization in Korea now here are some

237
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,560
changes on the bar well there were no

238
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:31,130
included string indeed in the malware

239
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,489
code discovered discovered from 2011 to

240
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,880
2012 for this alleged strain were

241
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,380
encrypted in the bar well because this

242
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,730
curve the prom 2013 to 2014 from 2015 to

243
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:49,970
2017 expl was the most widely used Maori

244
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:54,460
and Patty Spitler watch also used in

245
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:58,340
this year on new drop Alberto was used

246
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,300
the red eyes group is also known as FD

247
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,880
37

248
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,449
teams are one to one group one two three

249
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,730
vapor and stock dropped and so on

250
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,850
concern means winners in Korean the

251
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,420
second trend planet of the solar system

252
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:17,570
this group mainly uses the effect method

253
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,930
of sending an email that includes barrel

254
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,300
to each target this group is proud their

255
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,750
Hong Kong handle for the whiskey's and

256
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,719
although we fresh spray apparently

257
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:33,970
and listen Tori a text on Android

258
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,069
smartphone apps have been discovered the

259
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,370
major attacks target of this group are

260
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:42,550
Koreans humanoid activity activities and

261
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,370
North Korean defectors they even used

262
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,050
documents related to the military

263
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:50,740
protects according to you

264
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:55,660
hi I they also attacked Vietnam Japan

265
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:58,329
and the Middle East uh apparel is the

266
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,389
report on this group in spring this year

267
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:08,170
there is also an English program have a

268
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:10,990
lead if we were interested in 2014 Maria

269
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,589
was distributed to Japan Rose Korean

270
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,050
software the attack used their method of

271
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:19,839
tempering with on update files from

272
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:23,639
impacting their targets and similar

273
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,639
infection result was used in Korea in

274
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,639
2011

275
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,529
now let's have a look at some of the

276
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:44,540
major impaction method used in Korea

277
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:47,720
threat actors use various impatient

278
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,349
patterns product attacks first spear

279
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,319
fishing hair is mainly use macros and a

280
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,619
stompy stompy is Korea's Hong Kong

281
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:00,979
Hangul water processing program they -

282
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:03,949
is propel abilities in ActiveX which is

283
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,489
still widely used in South Korea as well

284
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:10,910
as vulnerabilities in IT management

285
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:13,369
systems let's treat take carry out

286
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,488
supply chain attacks usually by

287
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:21,920
tempering we get on installation or

288
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:25,249
update parts the attacks and purity is

289
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,099
good pipe disguise at document price to

290
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:31,369
attract the target these spear phishing

291
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,239
attacks are the most basic but still a

292
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:38,299
very useful method the lease piant of

293
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:41,239
email ultra would look at the icon and

294
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:45,739
file extension and easily mistake East

295
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:48,829
as a that multiply and open yet it said

296
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:54,259
that this method was also used in Russia

297
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:56,479
scale hacking incident in Japan another

298
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,910
common method of attack is using a

299
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,569
document file in stand up on a scooter

300
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,449
pie document file a text message carries

301
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:07,869
out usually by including malicious code

302
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,600
in the document file or multiple

303
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:14,569
document file to exploit vulnerabilities

304
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:18,349
but recently there are cases of sending

305
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:20,959
URL only instant of attachment and there

306
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:23,599
are all scare cases where the effect

307
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,679
processed and the normal document pi and

308
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:31,580
then only when there is open opens and

309
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:36,500
deployed thus the attacks and another

310
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:39,559
document that contains malware macros

311
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,889
macros used attacks that have never been

312
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:45,860
on the rise in recent recent years here

313
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:47,928
is an example of the macros attacks

314
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,780
well this parent offers an attachment

315
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:54,530
the business in ever contents is

316
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:57,320
displayed however this method he had

317
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,540
lost access right because the lease

318
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,809
parent could already see the document

319
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:07,340
documents clearly so the users who will

320
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:11,690
rest in crying to announce macro brought

321
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:16,449
around the 2017 attacks the body of the

322
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:19,070
document was in that Korea by Korea

323
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:22,190
increasing their chances that the

324
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,928
recipient in EV the macros awesome macro

325
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,480
started running the lease parent

326
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:31,760
sometimes with the seal robots arm

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,970
message the attacks also act using the

328
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,480
watering hole method in these muscles

329
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:42,140
the attackers they had website that

330
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,419
their intended targets are likely to be

331
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,120
in at the best end is point of

332
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,480
vulnerability of the web site in Korea

333
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,689
at across mostly take advantage of the

334
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,419
active exponent abilities activity as is

335
00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:00,020
still widely used in Korea this screen

336
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:04,760
has made many ActiveX destroyed maybe

337
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:07,879
nine is poised this effects is effective

338
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,179
because there are many website that

339
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:16,429
still use the old version of active

340
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:19,429
attacks this image shows the system

341
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:21,559
configuration used commonly by companies

342
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,500
and institution in Korea

343
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:26,330
normally internal computers cannot be

344
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,120
accessed from the outside

345
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,129
due to the security policy the IT

346
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,889
management system communication

347
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,140
communicates with each client to affect

348
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,940
the rest ease and signal antivirus

349
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:43,070
signatures and deploy security patches

that is the collective externally this

354
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,890
way the effect gains control of the

internal IT management system and

356
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,479
impacted all connected

00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:09,169
deploy pictures to this with malware

359
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:12,289
after a IT management system cannot be

365
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:29,629
such brutal speak fault of a system in

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:32,690
the reasoning state to project on high

mainly built around 10 years ago with

00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:52,759
matras concerned about the security down

372
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:57,049
today this is pro it involves sending a

analyzed the updated scheme the most

399
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:23,390
difficult difficult attacks to detect is

400
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:26,870
when a software development company is

401
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:30,560
active in this case sauce price or build

402
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:32,959
process compromised and eventually sub

403

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,010
distributed companies or organizations

that are already using a subdomain

406
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,290
ratified the superior as truth worth

407
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,290
software and even if what April

408
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,830
suspicious behaved is detected it is

409
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:55,399
likely to be overlooked it in some cases

410
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:59,409
main trace companies hectic and also

411
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,410
used for heck attacks

412
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:18,720
okay hastily in the present day

413
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:21,510
I know there are abroad five 500,000

414
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,780
Koreans living in Japan among these

415
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:28,290
there is organization as a union that

416
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:32,129
was caused by Korea residence in Japan

417
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:35,270
with close ties to North Korea in South

418
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:38,220
Korea it is a commonly called jeongyeon

419
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:43,500
access to the chung dong-young website

420
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:47,400
is rotted in south korea so it was only

421
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,640
those induced article that I found out

422
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,450
about the security issue on the union

423
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,000
with compaines this the article reported

424
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,670
all hacking of the campus and their

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
distribution of bar well beginning in

426
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:10,200
every 2017 to campbell implement

427
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,080
information about the instant i found a

428
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,140
report published by entity security and

429
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,470
use the machine translator translator to

430
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,990
lead aired in korean the report included

431
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,510
malware hash values and you are a

432
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,090
information i would write the you take

433
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,700
this opportunity to thank entity

434
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,649
security for publishing such as a great

435
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:37,950
default alga dramas this mary is the

436
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:40,760
download interesting enough this mario

437
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:45,090
was already collected by our lab in

438
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:48,150
February 2017 and the hacking of the

439
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:51,240
Tony our website occur with two most

440
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:54,270
after their collation of malware the

441
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,510
first their hacking incident did not use

442
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,000
the racist malware but use the Maria del

443
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:04,590
was already used the people was a little

444
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:11,940
unusual this is a backhoe the code is

445
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:14,970
similar to download in August 2017 to

446
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,810
unlap smart defense system is called the

447
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,530
util that expire for first they are try

448
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,129
to

449
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:27,930
attitude identical see to stop of this

450
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:30,390
insult the city server can be shared by

451
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:34,200
different attackers but the piling is

452
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:40,140
likely created by same group utilidad Fe

453
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:43,500
and util dot exe by the same group as

454
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,510
Pullum is identical to that of one used

455
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,940
by the Mario in the attacks on the

456
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:54,360
chung-yong website in April 2017 the

457
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:58,200
util that expired found in August 2017

458
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,350
Wario download that downloads price but

459
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,540
the code was different to their download

460
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:06,659
used the product on your website attack

461
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:11,520
but the downloaded pies could not be

462
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:14,760
verified from unless collation of

463
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,520
samples I found the pure by rails that

464
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,640
were similar to the one disputed through

465
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,780
the chun-yan website these similar

466
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,540
barriers exist Japanese website but this

467
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,420
IP address belong to the craft service

468
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:36,090
provide which shows that United States

469
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:40,190
as the several hosts in some cases so

470
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:44,340
let's put the information together l

471
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:47,390
every in 2017 tremulous website was

472
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,399
hacked it and Maria was distributed

473
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:53,640
according to our because the impression

474
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,960
of this Maria was reported in Japan

475
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:01,320
Korea and Vietnam on the same see to the

476
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:10,650
you till that X pile was distributed in

477
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:13,320
almost 2017 LLP protease imperiling 2017

478
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,900
mario similar to the download is which

479
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,110
distributed from the chun-yan website

480
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,190
was dissipated from another North

481
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,740
korea-related website this is what

482
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:32,419
interested me so far all the websites

483
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:35,090
that were a kid and you know disputed

484
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:39,350
from a lot of North Korean little

485
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:43,279
website it is seems like the attack

486
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:45,668
targets those building the website such

487
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:50,330
as North Korean researchers and

488
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:52,460
journalists we also found additional bar

489
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,399
well that is very likely to be

490
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,399
associated this appearance is disguised

491
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:02,539
as a real tech part all pylons are

492
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:06,139
similar i'll made before drawing 2017 do

493
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:11,950
not have any p.m. pictures but price

494
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:15,529
made from host 2017 have an TPM features

495
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:18,499
it has done at vm functions and cannot

496
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:22,309
be run in analyst programs who are on

497
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:27,489
watch or virtual environment when Logan

498
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:27,489
that expired has on injection function

499
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:34,509
first are all disguised as real tank

500
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:37,219
audio ready to file and have identical

501
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:39,950

504
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:53,269
service name is also disguised as a real

505
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:55,639
tag or the audio related service this

506
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:58,220
pile had coded for partial inverted

507
00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:02,809
detection the wearer's have the same

508
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:06,859
code the anti-villain code includes

509
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:09,799
almost all EDM techniques italy based on

510
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:14,389
kita you can find the source code and is

511
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:18,289
URL it checks every prime minister the

512
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:21,350
indented part is being executed by the

513
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:27,249
author and download the file from

514
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:30,529
outside and its duties here the rest of

515
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:33,259
the download part is encrypted by

516
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:36,739
decoding the first you can see though

517
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:39,320
the pilot paris is created under the

518
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:42,859
past but the downloaded part could not

519
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,220
be verified as we have seen the effects

520
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:49,460
on their website started in Japan

521
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,809
inflicted damage on target in Jeff Korea

522
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:56,990
Anders is related to Korea surely this

523
00:29:53,809 --> 00:30:00,080
is not the only case I believe that

524
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:07,220
there are many bro instance where the

525
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:10,549
two countries are being as we discuss

526
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:14,450
disco seed security issues in Korea and

527
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:17,600
Japan are related we have now summarized

528
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,779
important security issues in Korea I

529
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,969
hope the information about the present

530
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:26,740
situation in Korea is used purple

531
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:30,350
security research in Japan

532
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,840
pessimal many countries experiencing

533
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:36,158
damage from pain somewhere attacks and

534
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:39,500
it is the same for South Korea it seems

535
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,980
Mario developers are selling ransom oil

536
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:47,230
as the service and distributors by this

537
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:50,360
service poor description some resume

538
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:53,570
specifically targeting Korea and France

539
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,600
may only work on the Korean version of

Windows or Mario is downloaded your

541
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,769
website the prod price may be dropped it

542
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:08,209
when corrected from Korean IP or foreign

543
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:10,909
IPS lesson lesson where developers they

544
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,210
have also launches the attacks on unlit

545
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:19,429
products that interfere with their

546
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:21,769
previous there was a random attack on

547
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:27,679
Korean web hosting service provided in

548
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:30,320
June 2017 the attack infiltrated their

549
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,139
internal system of the web hosting

550
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,610
company and included the power within

551
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:41,769
the 153 servers using the Erebus newest

552
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:45,049
ransomware this attack affects around

553
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:48,620
5500 website and the service provided

554
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:50,330
paid over 1 billion US dollar investor

555
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,668
in return

556
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,220
tell received or recover program from

557
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:59,179
the ransomware crater but couldn't

558
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,110
recover all their data and in November

559
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:02,840
all the

560
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:08,149
rinax ran some wheels the heat to both

561
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:11,299
service providers in September this year

562
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:14,059
our unknown attack broke into the web

563
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,429
develop develop company during the

564
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:20,090
Chuseok she so is Korean Thanksgiving

565
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:23,029
holidays and encrypted all over each

00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:28,059
Christ data there the attack is also

567
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:28,059
known to have used Linux land somewhere

568
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:35,899
thread actors use several techniques to

569
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:39,018
bypass the secret friends and users at a

570
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:41,750
time mainly three techniques were used

571
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:47,299
creating big star big pyres using a

572
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:50,090
rotor and Palace fixed size is method

573
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:52,908
that were generated on fire of 50

574
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,789
megabyte or greater when a party's to us

575
00:32:52,909 --> 00:33:00,230
you can bypass the sender box that does

576
00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:03,590
not expect on at OPA so advanced

577
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:06,559
products to never cast users to so made

578
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,918
largely unknown past due to the Pokemon

579
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,158
slowdown in CODIS and the past since

580
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:17,120
increases the size overly prone spice

581
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:23,059
but attack can simply increase the file

582
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:28,939
size even more somewhere was over 100

583
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:32,450
megabyte there are two Road method the

584

Mario is in the road is earth or in

585
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:38,480
loose in direct the actual Mario data

586
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:41,720
from outside in the pronunciation the

587
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:46,250
Mario is not generated into a Python is

q2 excuted already in the memory in the

589
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:54,830
case you can analyze the bar well as

590
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:56,178
long as you analyze the rotor in the

591
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,730

595
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,520
suspicious pile was gathering the during

the investigating

597
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,670
generally only the scooter pies that

598

601
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,690
in many cases those part would have

602
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,850
already disappeared without the

603
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:33,159
encrypted data part you cannot

604
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,159
understand the specific function

violence is my well does not exist as a

when the sister would

614
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:18,320
operation server we have looked a threat

615
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,630
actors aim at Korea and Japan likely how

616
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,390
the cross distrust between the two

617
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:27,110
countries they are common targets

618
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,839
possums red actors there is instance

619
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:33,610
like the case studied mentioned today

620
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:36,230
were the attacks in Japan affects Korea

621
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,930
therefore the Security office and

622
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:42,140
analysts in their two countries should

623
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:46,819
pay attention to their security issues

624
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:50,359
that are happening in Korea in Japan how

625
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:53,600
screwed with the past as ourselves from

626
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,150
the threat aimed at us the essay is

627
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,940
cooperation we must share information

628
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:02,450
about the major attacks octane measured

629
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:05,180
Mario used Scelzi and Mario technics in

630
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,669
the post countries and maybe is going to

631
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,330
share such information within our

632
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:14,300
business circles in Japan I hope we can

633
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:17,090
work together on these issues and also

634
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:20,030
prom on close relationship between

635
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:25,280
security industries and researchers of

636
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:28,040
Korea and Japan thanks for your

637

attention I hope you have you all have

638
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,900
first time a code blue and they also

639
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,900
have a wandering time that working with

640
