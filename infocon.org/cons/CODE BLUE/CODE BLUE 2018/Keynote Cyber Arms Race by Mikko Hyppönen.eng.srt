1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,080
thank you very much for the introduction

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,099
and thanks to all of you for joining us

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:20,040
today here at code blue

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:24,250
my name is Miko and I hunt hackers

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,930
that's my job that's been my job most of

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:31,720
my life and when I say hackers I mean

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,219
the bad hackers the evil hackers the

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:40,449
criminals the people who write the

9
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:46,059
malware who run the botnets who sent the

10
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:46,570
spam and that's been my job for 27 years

11
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:52,419
now

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:55,499
I joined f-secure in 1991 and during

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,699
these 27 years we've gone through

14
00:00:55,499 --> 00:01:03,850
revolutions technological revolutions

15
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:07,420
first in the shape of internet becoming

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:13,710
commonplace and right now in the shape

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:17,590
of the IOT revolution being underway

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,899
eventually we might even see the third

19
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,140
major technological revolution during

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,480
one lifetime which would be artificial

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:31,570
intelligence it's gonna still take some

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:33,160
time for us to see real wide or AI but

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,759
it might just happen during one lifetime

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:43,690
so internet revolution IOT revolution

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:47,710
and AI revolution now I remember when I

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:51,729
set up the first website for f-secure it

27
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,580
was in April 1994 f-secure is

28
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:57,760
headquartered in Helsinki Finland and I

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,330
remember that in Finland there were 16

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,580
websites before our website our website

31
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:08,590
was website number 17

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:13,659
that's how early days it was but I still

33
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,810
remember how obvious it looked that this

34
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:18,440
will become a

35
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,569
huge thing worldwide web was going to

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,760
change the world and that's exactly what

37
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:30,019
happened and if you remember how it felt

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,540
like when internet was new when the web

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:39,560
was new it felt quite different from

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:43,459
today we thought that the Internet is

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,550
gonna change the world for the better we

42
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:50,450
felt that the internet was some kind of

43
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:54,739
utopia we have this new thing which is

44
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:57,170
gonna change the world everybody will be

45
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:01,489
there anybody can be in contact with

46
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:05,109
anyone else on the planet one world no

47
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:09,349
borders no distances no geography

48
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:11,180
utopium and as everybody can be in

49
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:16,399
contact with anyone else this is gonna

50
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:19,910
make crises and conflict easier to solve

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:25,280
that's what we thought he felt like a

52
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:28,480
dream unfortunately in many ways that

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,739
dream has now turned into a nightmare

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,620
from a dream to a nightmare

55
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:44,000
as we now know that Internet is being

56
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:48,170
used to contact mass sized crimes it's

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,269
being used to wage war it's being used

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:55,910
to spy on us and it's being used to do

59
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,810
blanket surveillance on citizens all

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:03,950
over the world

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:06,920
from a dream to a nightmare yes of

62
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:11,170
course Internet has brought us many

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,899
benefits but I don't think anybody saw

64
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:18,620
all these downsides it would bring as

65
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,798
well the fact that Internet can easily

66
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,200
be used to shape people's opinions it

67
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,340
can be used to change the outcome of

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,039
elections

69
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,109
and indeed it's being used by organized

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,480
crime gangs to make millions and

71
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:39,620
millions with their attacks from a dream

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,620
to a nightmare

73
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:48,560
we fight different kinds of enemies when

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,340
we are trying to protect our systems

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:57,300
there are criminals trying to make money

76
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,760
there are intelligence agencies trying

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,160
to spy on companies and countries there

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,450
are militaries who are waging war on the

79
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,200
internet but the most common problem

80
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:13,380
indeed is the money making criminal and

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,770
money making criminals are pretty

82
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:20,400
democratic in their attacks what I mean

83
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:23,099
by that is that these guys don't really

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,609
care who you are or where you are as

85
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:31,380
long as they make their money so for

86
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:35,820
example if a credit card gang trying to

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,800
steal credit cards as long as they are

88
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,919
able to steal credit cards they don't

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,810
really care if the victim is in Japan or

90
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,760
in the United States or in Germany it

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,280
doesn't matter they don't care if the

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,680
credit card is from a private person or

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,229
is from a company it doesn't matter it's

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,350
a credit card so these are very

95
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,650
democratic attacks they target everybody

96
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,450
everywhere they don't care who you are

97
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,840
which is quite different from targeted

98
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:10,530
attacks such as espionage attacks which

99
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:17,719
are very narrowly targeted to specific

100
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:21,989
targets but criminals have a problem

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,600
while it's fairly easy to gain access to

102
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,880
large amounts of credit card numbers or

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,820
large amounts of bank accounts the

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,630
problem they have is how to move that

105
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:38,099
money in the real world without getting

106
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:40,210
caught so in effect how to convert a

107
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:43,050
large collection of stolen credit card

108
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,888
into a Ferrari without getting caught

109
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:50,740
and this is surprisingly hard this is

110
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:53,100
hard because the money conversion and

111
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,800
money laundering is the choking point

112
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,229
this is how we can limit the benefits

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,750
that online criminals are getting from

114
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,150
their crimes it's fairly easy for them

115
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,250
to create large amounts of victims and

116
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,620
gain access to valuable data but it's

117
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,039
fairly hard for them to get the value

118
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,120
out of that without getting caught

119
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,500
it's the choking point and we should

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,090
choke these criminals as hard as we can

121
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:24,849
by limiting their access to money

122
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:27,969
laundering systems now we do know some

123
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:31,120
mechanisms that they use to try to move

124
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:34,930
the money to the real world let me play

125
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,680
you a security camera footage from Spain

126
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:43,150
in an operation run by the carbonic gang

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:47,169
take a look at the ATM suddenly it spits

128
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:52,388
out money pretty nice I like ATMs like

129
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:55,659
this this guy is a money mule his job is

130
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,699
to be there and order money from the

131
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,610
system he's using his phone to order

132
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,740
more money out of the ATM machine

133
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,590
he even has a back with him so he can

134
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,159
fill it with money this is how these

135
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:11,440
guys were trying to move their profits

136
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:15,009
from the online world to the real world

137
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,349
but there are limits to how much money

138
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,500
you can make like this how much money is

139
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,690
there in one ATM maybe a few tens of

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,490
thousands of dollars or Euros in this

141
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,490
case euros because this is in Spain

142
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,159
that's a lot of money but it's no

143
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:38,140
Ferrari and this is the reason why we

144
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:41,260
are now seeing a very clear trend in the

145
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,949
attacks that criminals are making we are

146
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,860
seeing more and more attacks which are

147
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:52,860
targeting these new cryptocurrency based

148
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,860
systems instead of traditional targets

149
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,990
why is this happening it's happening

150
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:05,030
because money is now data money has

151
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:09,220
become data and just like real world

152
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:12,980
criminals love cash online criminals

153
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:16,730
love Bitcoin and aetherium and Manero

154
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:20,720
and zette cash and litecoin and all

155
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,150
these different cryptocurrencies which

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,520
of course doesn't mean that these

157
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:30,170
cryptocurrencies would be bad they're

158
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:33,250
not just like cash isn't bad most of us

159
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,510
have cash in our pockets right now

160
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,750
exactly the same thing applies to

161
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,689
cryptocurrencies cash is a tool

162
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:46,120
cryptocurrencies are tools they can be

163
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,120
used for good they can be used for bad

164
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:56,050
but these benefits that criminals see in

165
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:59,360
cryptocurrencies are very clear for them

166
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,420
so we are now seeing more and more cases

167
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,450
where the very same cyber criminals

168
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,979
which used to be targeting online banks

169
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,420
or online shops are now targeting

170
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,400
cryptocurrency exchanges or

171
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:18,829
cryptocurrency wallets and the reason is

172
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,939
that if they gain access to

173
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:25,010
cryptocurrencies then their profits are

174
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,690
already laundered they're already

175
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:31,490
anonymized they are already untrackable

176
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,000
so they can't go and buy their Ferrari

177
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,140
with bitcoins without getting caught

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,880
when you look at this from the point of

179
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,300
view of of the criminals it makes

180
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,480
perfect sense so we are seeing a trend

181
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,120
in which attackers who used to be

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,850
targeting traditional cybercrime targets

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,770
are now doing more of the attacks where

184
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:57,110
they target cryptocurrency systems and

185
00:10:51,770 --> 00:11:00,439
for most of us this is good news because

186
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,190
most of us work in defending traditional

187
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,080
companies so the more these criminals

188
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,620
are moving from targeting traditional

189
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,279
company

190
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,440
such as online stores or banks into

191
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,630
targeting cryptocurrency system that's

192
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,210
better for us it's bad for you if you

193
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,790
are trying to secure a cryptocurrency

194
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:27,920
exchange but it's good for you if you're

195
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:31,520
not so the underlying technology in most

196
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,189
cryptocurrency systems is blockchain and

197
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,910
blockchain is a public ledger of

198
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,950
transactions that's all it is public

199
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,140
ledger of transactions anything you put

200
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:46,930
in the blockchain it's going to be

201
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:49,580
unchangeable forever and public forever

202
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,170
well in most block chains for example

203
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,870
the Bitcoin blockchain is like this

204
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:59,529
anything you put in there it's gonna be

205
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:02,360
unchangeable and public forever and

206
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:05,870
blockchain is a real and genuine

207
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,540
innovation do you know how you can tell

208
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,260
that some innovation is a major

209
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:14,000
innovation you can tell when the

210
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,900
innovation is explained to you and it

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,510
seems obvious like blockchain a public

212
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,030
ledger of transactions huh that's it

213
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,850
yeah that's it that seems pretty obvious

214
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,500
yes it does but it wasn't obvious ten

215
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:34,310
years ago when it was invented by

216
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:38,690
Satoshi Nakamoto but one question I get

217
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:42,310
regularly about the public nature of

218
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:45,530
blockchain is that if it indeed is

219
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:48,729
public how come we can't find the

220
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,439
criminals and that's a great question

221
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:54,220
because indeed indeed every transaction

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,160
in the both Bitcoin blockchain is public

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:02,779
you can go home today and download the

224
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,120
whole Bitcoin blockchain and that one

225
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,029
file will contain every single

226
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,450
transaction ever done in Bitcoin from

227
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:13,790
the first transaction in 2008 it's all

228
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,550
there in one single file so how hard

229
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,839
would it be to follow the movements of

230
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,319
money in this blockchain since

231
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,829
everything is public

232
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:29,769
well let's take a look this here

233
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:31,930
visualizes one Bitcoin wallet the circle

234
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,570
at the centre of the screen visualizes

235
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,829
the address in which victims of the

236
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:46,290
Petya ransomware Trojan were sending

237
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:46,290
their ransoms to ransom payments on the

238
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:56,229
26th of July last year we saw that the

239
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,839
gang behind petia started moving money

240
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,610
from the original wallet they moved to

241
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,670
the bitcoins from the original wallet to

242
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:06,009
six new words and you can see the size

243
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,790
of the transaction visualized by the

244
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:11,860
size of the circle and it is easy to see

245
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,360
you just download the Bitcoin blockchain

246
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,819
and look at transactions you can see

247
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,250
them doing these transactions so how

248
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:20,949
hard would it be to follow these

249
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,740
transactions further until they move the

250
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:28,979
money through an exchange to the real

251
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:33,130
world 2 euros or dollars or rubles well

252
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:37,029
this was the 26th of July on the next

253
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:43,089
day they moved the money from these six

254
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:47,079
wallets to these wallets and this went

255
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:49,630
on for several days and then they

256
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,979
started moving money from the Bitcoin

257
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,750
blockchain to the Monaro

258
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,040
blockchain and that's where we lose

259
00:14:52,750 --> 00:15:03,459
track we have no idea where the money

260
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:05,199
went online criminals love crypto

261
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,930
currencies just like real world

262
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,139
criminals love cash because they're

263
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:15,849
anonymous there untrackable easy to

264
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:19,089
launder and this is the reason why we've

265
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,910
seen this massive amount of ransomware

266
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,250
trojans here's a road map for ransomware

267
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,199
trojan families and the road map has

268
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,810
become so large it doesn't even fit on a

269
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,990
single slide anymore

270
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,790
we are tracking hundreds of different

271
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,650
ransomware trojans out there

272
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,589
and more are being generated all the

273
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:42,910
time cryptocurrencies are the

274
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:46,210
explanation for this explosion we had

275
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,189
ransomware trojans before Bitcoin but

276
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:52,360
they never became a big problem now they

277
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:55,930
are a massive problem we're also seeing

278
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,380
a lot of scams where online scammers are

279
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,380
trying to fool people to lose their

280
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,650
crypto currencies for example scams

281
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,170
where they pose as celebrities like Elon

282
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:12,160
Musk here Elon Musk is giving away free

283
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,810
money free ethereum just send him a tiny

284
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,510
amount of money and he will send you

285
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,170
back ten times more and of course he

286
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,790
won't because that's not Ilyn musk if

287
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,189
you look at the Twitter handle that's

288
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:31,660
Elon Musk with three L's so does anybody

289
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,960
fall for this well the transactions are

290
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,490
public we can look at the ethereum

291
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,680
address in the ethereum blockchain in

292
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,020
this case that address has received two

293
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,060
hundred and eighty three ether which

294
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,140
translates to two hundred thousand US

295
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:52,750
dollars so yeah people do fall for this

296
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:55,270
and different people are being used to

297
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,980
send these scam messages typically on

298
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,430
Twitter

299
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,430
I've been used here's a tweet which I

300
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,310
didn't send in which I'm giving away

301
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,460
free Bitcoin free ethereum and free

302
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,310
litecoin 1000 bitcoins that's a lot of

303
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,810
money that's around six million dollars

304
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:18,369
fifteen thousand aetherium that's

305
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,260
roughly the same I know that's not me

306
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,520
because my Twitter handle is not a

307
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,520
revoir e43

308
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:36,950
and then we see regularily actual thefts

309
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:42,350
especially v targeting cryptocurrency

310
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:44,810
wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges all

311
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,000
these cryptocurrency exchanges have been

312
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:54,440
hacked and this makes a lot of sense

313
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,240
from the attackers point of view when

314
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,580
attackers want to make a lot of money

315
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,650
they have to target an organization

316
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,850
which has a lot of money for example a

317
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:07,130
bank banks have billions if you can

318
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:11,379
break into a bank you can steal billions

319
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:13,820
but it's hard to break into a bank why

320
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,640
because banks have been around for

321
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,830
decades or even hundreds of years they

322
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,820
have thousands or tens of thousands of

323
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:26,570
employees their security team has dozens

324
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:31,000
of people they've been doing security

325
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,000
for decades it's a hard target

326
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:39,740
however these exchanges many of them

327
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,610
control billions of dollars it seems

328
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,350
crazy but it's true the amount of

329
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,629
cryptocurrencies they have in their

330
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,620
accounts can translate the billions of

331
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:54,560
US dollars but these companies have not

332
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,780
been around for decades they do not have

333
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,629
thousands of employees they don't have

334
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,590
dozens of security people these are

335
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:06,950
startups the whole company might have 20

336
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:09,020
people this is an easy target when you

337
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,440
compare it to a bank but the amount of

338
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,230
money you can steal is roughly the same

339
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,930
as hacking into a bank this is why

340
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,930
exchanges are being targeted

341
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:30,090
and such attacks where exchanges are

342
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:34,620
being targeted or not only done by

343
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:39,209
criminals in some cases they are being

344
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:42,600
done by government especially North

345
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:45,180
Korea has a track record of trying to

346
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,629
break into cryptocurrency exchanges to

347
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:52,850
steal cryptocurrencies North Korea was

348
00:19:48,630 --> 00:20:01,400
also behind the one a cry attack from

349
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:06,439
2017 and that's highly highly unusual

350
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:10,590
highly unusual to see that a government

351
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:15,930
would be willing to go so low that they

352
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:18,090
are ready to steal from others it seems

353
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,580
incredible that there is a country on

354
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,550
this planet which is willing to create

355
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,149
and deploy ransomware trojans to try to

356
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:32,430
fix their budget deficit but that's what

357
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:35,000
we've seen and this makes the attacks

358
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:38,010
that we've seen from North Korea unique

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,370
when you look at governmental attacks in

360
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:48,600
general they're almost always either

361
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:50,850
spying or waging war the only exception

362
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,080
is North Korea North Korea is the only

363
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:57,510
country which has been using

364
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:04,320
governmental attacks to steal money so

365
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:05,460
it's typically spying or waging war we

366
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,360
often see the word

367
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:12,030
cyber war being used in headlines when

368
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,189
governments are doing attacks against

369
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:18,320
each other and almost always when you

370
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:25,020
read the word cyber war from a newspaper

371
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:27,590
it actually isn't cyber war because the

372
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,660
most typical attacks that governments do

373
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:34,879
are done by their intelligence agencies

374
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,880
to do espionage or spying

375
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:42,630
and espionage isn't war

376
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:45,990
spying isn't war espionage is espionage

377
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,919
spying is spying and if something isn't

378
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:52,380
war

379
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:56,159
we shouldn't be calling it war because

380
00:21:52,380 --> 00:22:03,870
words matter and we need the word cyber

381
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:07,230
war for real cyber war now I don't

382
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:11,070
believe that we will ever see a cyber

383
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,840
war between two countries where all the

384
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,990
fighting would only be done in

385
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,809
cyberspace or in the online world

386
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:22,889
because from my point of view cyber is

387
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:26,039
just another domain for war if you look

388
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:29,428
at the kind of wars we were fighting 500

389
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:31,590
years ago we only had land war because

390
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,130
the only weapons we had were like swords

391
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:38,250
and bow and arrow but eventually we had

392
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:42,120
good enough boats that we could expand

393
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:45,360
the war from land to sea so we got sea

394
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,489
war but the invention of sea war didn't

395
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,750
take away land war we were now fighting

396
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:55,320
wars on both land and sea then we got

397
00:22:51,750 --> 00:23:00,929
planes air war then we got satellites

398
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:03,149
space war and now cyber space war so

399
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:05,700
these are new domains and when there is

400
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:08,939
a conflict or war between two countries

401
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:17,510
it's typically being fought in all of

402
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:23,370
these domains exactly in the same manner

403
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:26,669
spying is expanding to new domains cyber

404
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:30,658
domain spying is collecting information

405
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:32,639
and information has changed information

406
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,279
used to be something like that it used

407
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:37,860
to be physical so if you want to steal

408
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,019
this information you have to come to

409
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,990
this information to steal this piece of

410
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:47,250
paper or to copy this piece of paper and

411
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,690
as you know today information is virtual

412
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,360
information

413
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,660
on our computers it in our networks and

414
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:59,159
you don't have to go anywhere to steal

415
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,780
that information so a couple of years

416
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:05,430
ago I was giving an interview for a

417
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:08,129
newspaper about cyber spying and the

418
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:12,180
quote I gave to the journalist was that

419
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:15,090
spying has moved from the real world to

420
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,550
the online world and it is what they

421
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,560
printed in the newspaper

422
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,840
Mikko opponent says that spying has

423
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:26,870
moved from the real world to the online

424
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:29,399
world the next day my phone rings a

425
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,219
friend of mine who works at an

426
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,340
intelligence agency calls me up and he

427
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,190
tells me that you know Meachem you're

428
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,679
wrong

429
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,230
spying has not moved from the real world

430
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,330
to the online world spying has expanded

431
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,670
from the real world to the online world

432
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,620
the real world spies haven't got

433
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,720
anywhere they're still there they're

434
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,899
still doing their work in the real world

435
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,350
but now there's new kind of spying

436
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,780
happening in the online world and I

437
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,449
totally believe him because at f-secure

438
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,480
we track things happening on the

439
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:09,060
Internet we have no idea what real world

440
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,080
spies are doing we don't follow that

441
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:15,120
stuff so to us it looked like spying had

442
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,460
moved from the real world to the online

443
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,399
world when in reality it had only

444
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,400
expanded through the online world

445
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,730
so what would be an example of a

446
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:34,650
conflict or war between two countries

447
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:39,860
which would be fought in all of these

448
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:44,580
domains land sea air space and

449
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:47,669
cyberspace well for example the conflict

450
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,490
between Russia and Ukraine Russia and

451
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:53,420
Ukraine have been at war for five years

452
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:57,050
now during that war we've seen multiple

453
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:03,690
cyber attacks done with cyber weapons

454
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:07,820
from Russia targeting Ukraine and it's

455
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,980
no wonder that government and especially

456
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:17,419
militaries are interested in offensive

457
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,420
use of cyber power this is no surprise

458
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:25,490
governments love cyber weapons why

459
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:30,840
because cyber weapons are effective

460
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:33,600
affordable and deniable effective

461
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,060
affordable deniable that's a pretty good

462
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,340
combination in a weapon when you have a

463
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,000
weapon which is effective it gets the

464
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,169
job done

465
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,790
it's affordable it's cheap and it's

466
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:50,390
deniable you can deny that it wasn't you

467
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:55,860
and especially the deniability part is

468
00:26:50,390 --> 00:27:01,190
very strong in cyberattacks when you do

469
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:05,310
a real-world attack like sending a a

470
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:08,820
fighter jets to another country it's

471
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:12,240
kind of hard to deny but when you do the

472
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:16,020
same thing with a cyber attack

473
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,800
you can keep denying it forever a great

474
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:23,370
example is Stuxnet from 2010 the Stuxnet

475
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,530
case is very well known we all know who

476
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,939
did it it was the government of United

477
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:33,830
States and Israel targeting the nuclear

478
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,730
enrichment systems of Iran however

479
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,550
governments of the United States and

480
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,870
Israel sorry government of United States

481
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:44,520
and Israel are still denying this

482
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:48,479
they're still denying that they're

483
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:56,610
behind it and we can't prove it because

484
00:27:48,480 --> 00:28:01,110
cyber weapons are deniable so we've got

485
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:05,010
a good example of real-world usage of a

486
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:09,270
cyber weapon in a cyber war last summer

487
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:14,370
summer of 2017 with the petia or not

488
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:17,940
petia attack this was a cyber weapon

489
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:21,360
which claimed to be a ransomware trojan

490
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:25,950
it wasn't it was a destructive trojan

491
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:30,240
which was designed to halt the society

492
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:32,310
of one country Ukraine it looked like a

493
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,990
ransomware Trojan but it wasn't even if

494
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:38,690
you paid the ransom you wouldn't get

495
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:41,640
your files back so how were the Russians

496
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:45,980
targeting one country how was the

497
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:49,680
targeting done well to target just

498
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:53,310
Ukraine they used an attack against the

499
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:56,700
Ukrainian software company the russians

500
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,639
hacked into a company manufacturing this

501
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:04,040
piece of software a bookkeeping software

502
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,960
a bookkeeping software called m.e dock

503
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,030
the software is made by a company in

504
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,730
Kiev in Ukraine the capital of Ukraine

505
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:15,330
and this software is only used in

506
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:18,030
Ukraine it only runs in Ukrainian

507
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:20,850
language it can be used to do

508
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:24,540
bookkeeping and very importantly it can

509
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:26,429
be used to file taxes through the

510
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,399
Ukrainian government this is the de

511
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,550
facto way how Ukrainian companies file

512
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,820
their taxes every year to the Ukrainian

513
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:39,120
text or authorities all Ukrainian

514
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,419
companies run this so the Russian

515
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,350
attacker is hacked into this company and

516
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:50,250
they hacked their update servers and

517
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,919
then on the 29th of June 2017 they sent

518
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,190
out

519
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,790
an extra update to every customer and

520
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:02,360
that update was petia if you were

521
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:06,230
running ma dock on the 29th of June you

522
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,629
got infected and once one machine was

523
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:12,670
infected in your network then petia

524
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:15,980
started stealing access tokens and

525
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:18,020
credentials to spread further in the

526
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,860
network and in many cases it gained

527
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:23,570
access to admin credentials even domain

528
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,050
admin credentials meaning it spreads

529
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,050
like wildfire

530
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:34,010
the end result in Ukraine were

531
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:37,459
devastating majority of Ukrainian

532
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,810
companies were hit they lost massive

533
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,520
amount of data the whole society

534
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:48,790
suffered however this is not the story

535
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:52,310
we heard in the summer of 2017

536
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:55,580
instead we heard a story about Western

537
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:58,129
companies fighting

538
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,189
petia all over the world companies from

539
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:05,330
Europe companies from North America from

540
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:08,950
South America from Asia and these

541
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,949
companies had nothing to do with Ukraine

542
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:17,120
construction material companies food

543
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:20,720
companies or companies like Maersk which

544
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,510
ships containers all over the world

545
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,010
these companies from Denmark it has

546
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:31,100
nothing to do with Ukraine

547
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:32,480
why did masks get hit well even though

548
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,560
this company has nothing to do with

549
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,080
Ukraine they do business in Ukraine

550
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,760
every fifth container on the planet is

551
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,030
shipped by this company many of them

552
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,370
being shipped to Ukraine which means

553
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:48,980
this company has to file taxes in

554
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:51,260
Ukraine and if you have to file taxes

555
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,080
the way you do it is by running a me

556
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,330
dock

557
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,040
so the 29th of June masks got an

558
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,320
internal infection into their network

559
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,320
through the Emma dock update

560
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:12,529
the infection spread like wildfire and

561
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:14,879
over wrote 40,000 laptops 40,000 laptops

562
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:18,659
but that's not the worst part

563
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:23,549
it also overwrite overrode 4000 servers

564
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:28,919
and the problem when you lose 4,000

565
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:31,139
servers instantly is that it is hard to

566
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,840
fix because those servers are in data

567
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:37,559
centers around the world and once they

568
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,439
get infected by petia those machines are

569
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,440
no longer running Windows now they are

570
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,279
running petia which means you can't

571
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,519
remotely fix them

572
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:52,619
you can't remotely manage them anymore

573
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:54,960
you have to physically go on location so

574
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:57,418
during the petty outbreak many companies

575
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,269
were sending consultants on planes to

576
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:03,389
data centers around the world carrying

577
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:07,849
Windows boot cd-roms in their backpacks

578
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:07,849
to go and rebuild servers from scratch

579
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:14,099
but that's not the worst part either

580
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:16,649
in addition of losing 40,000

581
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:21,599
workstations and 4,000 servers they also

582
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:26,189
lost their 80s their Active Directory

583
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:32,399
servers this company had 151 ad servers

584
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:35,729
all over the world ad servers contain

585
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,629
the user information usernames logins

586
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:42,330
passwords credentials and the

587
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:47,099
authorization info what kind of rights

588
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:48,689
does this user have this company had

589
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,369
hundred and fifty one 80s

590
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,450
all over the world and they did not have

591
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:56,009
a backup of this data I mean why would

592
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,710
you need a backup you already have

593
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:00,809
hundred and fifty one backups these

594
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,999
servers are constantly synchronizing the

595
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:06,570
information with each other and

596
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:10,740
certainly you're not gonna lose all 151

597
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:13,139
a DS at the same time except

598
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,790
that's exactly what happened when petia

599
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,820
started spreading it over brought all of

600
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:21,540
their a DS and now they no longer had a

601
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:23,850
network even if you would rebuild a

602
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,980
laptop that laptop would have no network

603
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,350
that it could login to because there was

604
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,619
no network anymore since all ATS were

605
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,618
lost

606
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:36,810
although when they started investigating

607
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,210
the case they realized that they had

608
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:43,500
hundred and fifty-one ATS and of those

609
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:45,480
they could confirm that 150 were

610
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,710
overwritten and then there was one ad

611
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,690
that they couldn't find eventually they

612
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:55,399
figure it out

613
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:58,770
the missing ad was in Africa in Ghana

614
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:01,230
turns out that the data center in Ghana

615
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,560
had a power outage during the petty

616
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:07,940
outbreak so then they made a very

617
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,820
careful phone call to Ghana Africa

618
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:14,430
availing the IT staff there not to plug

619
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,800
in the server and then they send someone

620
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,960
physically to go and collect it this is

621
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:27,540
how they rebuilt their network they got

622
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:31,220
lucky so what was the mistake what was

623
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,220
the mistake that these companies made

624
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:37,680
they had to run this software there is

625
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,299
no option if you want to do business in

626
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,310
Ukraine you have to file taxes in

627
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,540
Ukraine if you want to file taxes in

628
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,970
Ukraine you have to run this software

629
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:49,740
the default setting in the software was

630
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:51,899
automatic updates enabled and if these

631
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,649
companies would have come to me before

632
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,980
Padilla and asked my opinion that is

633
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:01,080
this a good idea is it a good idea to

634
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,109
leave the default setting of automatic

635
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:07,350
updates enabled I would have tell them

636
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:09,450
yes because this is what we have been

637
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,580
telling companies for 10 years patch

638
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,980
your systems update your systems

639
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,890
automatic updates will give you better

640
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:21,440
security well in this case it was the

641
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:23,190
updates which burned these companies

642
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,670
nobody expects

643
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:33,780
to get hacked just because they run a

644
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:37,250
bookkeeping software so we're these

645
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:41,849
Western companies just collateral damage

646
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:43,980
lost is an accident that the attack

647
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:47,160
which was trying to target only Ukraine

648
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:53,040
also created massive problems outside of

649
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:57,420
Ukraine the size of this problem is huge

650
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,029
I believe that Petya was the single most

651
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:05,000
expensive computer security incident in

652
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:08,369
history I believe this cost more money

653
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,010
than anything more money than any other

654
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:14,160
malware outbreak more money than any

655
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:20,460
hack ever more money than any data leak

656
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:23,430
ever and this happened last year so

657
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,000
maybe these companies out companies

658
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:31,919
outside of Ukraine were just collateral

659
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,950
damage or maybe maybe the Russians were

660
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,740
trying to send a message and the message

661
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:41,540
is don't do business in Ukraine if you

662
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,540
do business in Ukraine we will hurt you

663
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:53,099
we don't know which one it is nobody

664
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:57,299
expects to get hacked because they run

665
00:37:53,099 --> 00:38:02,490
bookkeeping software nobody expects to

666
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:07,619
have a data bridge but it is what we

667
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:11,220
should be expecting and right now it

668
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,290
takes an awfully long time for companies

669
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,089
to detect that they have a bridge unless

670
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,190
the bridge is something drastic like

671
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:20,490
petia which you of course will notice

672
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,520
right away we know this because we run

673
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:28,919
Incident Response Teams

674
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:32,040
at f-secure and whenever we get a phone

675
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:36,579
call to our incident response team it's

676
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:42,219
almost always somebody who's calling

677
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:45,459
and he's having a panic attack like we

678
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:49,059
were just hacked can you come right away

679
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:51,339
and our guys rush over start

680
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:54,880
investigating the hack only to realize

681
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:59,739
that yes the company was hacked but it

682
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,599
was hacked last year they only noticed

683
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,459
it now but they were hacked last year

684
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,380
and there was no urgency our guys could

685
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:09,669
have come next week and it would have

686
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:12,969
been exactly the same on average it

687
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:21,059
takes 200 days for companies to realize

688
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:23,920
that they've had a bridge two months ago

689
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:27,789
we heard about the Ticketmaster bridge

690
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,859
in which 40,000 people lost their credit

691
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:32,859
card numbers as they were buying tickets

692
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:39,519
to different events from Ticketmaster

693
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:42,429
calm how did this happen well it

694
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:45,848
happened because Ticketmaster had

695
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:46,859
installed a chatbot on every page on

696
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,779
their website

697
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:51,189
you know these chat windows that pop up

698
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:53,949
from the right corner of the browser

699
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:56,678
when you go to a website where there's

700
00:39:53,949 --> 00:40:00,719
some helpful individual asking that how

701
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:03,880
can I help you well that pop-up window

702
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:08,380
is effectively a couple of lines of

703
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,119
JavaScript in this case the service was

704
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,890
actually purchased from a third-party

705
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:17,589
company a company called in benta then

706
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:20,348
inventor cut hacked and the attackers

707
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:22,929
changed the JavaScript which was loaded

708
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:25,650
on every page of Ticketmaster and when I

709
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:29,529
say every page I mean every page

710
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:31,509
including the pages where users check

711
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:34,689
out their tickets and including the

712
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:38,380
pages where customers type in the credit

713
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:40,299
card numbers so now the JavaScript was

714
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:44,369
reprogrammed to steal the credit card

715
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:44,369
numbers as users were typing it in

716
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:51,660
nobody expects to get hacked because of

717
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,660
a chat

718
00:40:52,260 --> 00:41:01,569
or if we look at once one of the largest

719
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:04,450
credit-card theft in history five years

720
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:06,550
ago we saw the case with target one of

721
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,520
the largest retail chains in the United

722
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,920
States they didn't lose forty thousand

723
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,050
credit cards they lost 40 million credit

724
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,020
cards 40 million credit card numbers

725
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:20,890
which were stolen over months and months

726
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:24,640
as customers were paying for their

727
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:27,270
purchases at the cashier desks in Target

728
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,190
shops they lost their credit card number

729
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:35,349
because the credit card terminals had

730
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:40,150
been modified by an attacker how did the

731
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:43,240
attacker get in well the attackers got

732
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:46,900
in through the ventilation system and

733
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:49,058
when I say ventilation I don't mean Tom

734
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,550
Cruise or Bruce Willis crawling in

735
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:54,160
through the ventilation pipes what I

736
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:57,250
mean is that the attackers hacked the

737
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,930
computers running the ventilation and

738
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:04,480
refrigeration systems used by target

739
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:07,319
because ventilation systems today in

740
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,349
every building are being controlled by

741
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:14,290
ICS boxes industrial control system

742
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:17,770
effectively light up servers which don't

743
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,650
look like Linux servers once the

744
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,809
attackers got into the ventilation

745
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,660
computers they were able to move from

746
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:28,329
there the core routing network of target

747
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:32,700
from there to the financial network and

748
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,700
from there to the credit-card terminals

749
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,970
nobody expects to get hacked through the

750
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,770
ventilation systems but this is what

751
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:49,959
happened and the larger your network the

752
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:54,040
harder it is to keep attackers out how

753
00:42:49,960 --> 00:43:00,700
many of the fortune 500 companies are

754
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:01,859
hacked right now answer 500 every single

755
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,759
one of them

756
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:08,700
why well if you are a fortune 500

757
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:11,519
company you have at least hundred

758
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,499
thousand workstations and if you have

759
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,410
hundred thousand workstations to have a

760
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:18,569
bridge guaranteed somewhere in the

761
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,629
network it might be something small it

762
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:25,680
might be a single infected laptop in an

763
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:28,499
airport lounge but that's a bridge so

764
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,450
the larger your network the more likely

765
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:32,450
it is that you have a bridge right now

766
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:43,289
and it's no longer enough to only

767
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:45,479
protect our computers I'm a computer

768
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:48,299
security guy I've been a computer

769
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:52,979
security guy all my life and I used to

770
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:56,160
think that my job is to secure computers

771
00:43:52,979 --> 00:44:00,029
I'm a computer security guy I secure

772
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:05,160
computers well you know what everything

773
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:08,759
is becoming a computer our societies run

774
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,640
on computers lights are on in this room

775
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:14,400
thanks to computers the breakfast you

776
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,969
had was most likely at least partially

777
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:23,009
made in a food processing plant which is

778
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:25,619
being run by computers so when you work

779
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:28,799
in computer security your job is not

780
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:32,729
it's not to secure computers your job is

781
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,680
to secure the society our job is to

782
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:37,769
secure the society because the whole

783
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:41,239
society our societies run on computers

784
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:44,038
and that's a pretty big responsibility

785
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:48,119
to be put on a bunch of geeks and nerds

786
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:54,660
like us but that's what we've got that's

787
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:57,119
what we have to do and we are seeing

788
00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:00,529
more and more attacks which are

789
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:04,499
targeting these new kinds of devices

790
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:08,119
devices like that over the last five

791
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:10,379
years we've found an ever-increasing

792
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,589
number of botnets

793
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,780
which only infect things that are not

794
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:17,700
computers these botnets don't in

795
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:23,510
Computers at all the only in fact

796
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:26,069
connected devices or IOT devices

797
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:33,570
probably the most famous of them is

798
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:37,350
Mirai from late 2016 Mirai which as you

799
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:39,900
know it's Japanese means the future this

800
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:44,240
is the future of malware as well malware

801
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,240
which is no longer infecting computers

802
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,370
and I remember when Mira I was going

803
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,509
around when the first Mirai outbreak

804
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:57,859
started the botnet was used to launch a

805
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:02,640
massively large denial of service attack

806
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,100
against the second largest domain name

807
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,440
service provider on the planet

808
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:10,049
effectively hurting the whole internet

809
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,190
internet didn't work very well on the

810
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:16,980
first days of the Mirai outbreak so we

811
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,360
were scanning the internet trying to

812
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,880
figure out where all the infected

813
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,250
machines were and what the machines were

814
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,230
because they were not computers some of

815
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:29,370
them were kitchen appliances many of

816
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:32,700
them were security cameras and I

817
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:35,370
remember I called this one law firm that

818
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:38,370
we fingerprinted as having an attack

819
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:42,560
coming from their network I actually

820
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:44,279
called them up on the phone hello hello

821
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,110
this is Nick

822
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,450
nice to meet you do you have a

823
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:54,510
mitsubishi heat pump installed in your

824
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:58,230
office yes we do it's right there on the

825
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:01,670
wall is it working yeah it's working

826
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:06,150
fine we believe that your heat pump is

827
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:09,210
infected by a bot and your heat pump is

828
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:11,490
right now launching an attack against

829
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:15,780
the second-largest name service provider

830
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:21,319
on the Internet do you know what he

831
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:21,320
answered he said uh-huh

832
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:29,810
and then he said oh yeah cool he thought

833
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:35,509
it was cool that their heat pump was

834
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:37,759
part of a global botany so Mirai was not

835
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,010
the wake-up call that we needed for

836
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,510
people to start to pay attention to IOT

837
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:48,080
security people are not too worried

838
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,460
about their connected devices and this

839
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,279
is because they think about the wrong

840
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:56,330
problem so for example if somebody buys

841
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,580
a smart refrigerator in their kitchen

842
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:01,040
refrigerator which is on the internet

843
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,560
which means when they are shopping they

844
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,950
can actually look inside their fridge

845
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,480
and see what's missing and they're not

846
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,899
worried about those getting hacked cuz

847
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,730
it's a fridge yes I have an

848
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,970
internet-connected fridge I don't care

849
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:21,440
if somebody hacks it it's just a fridge

850
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:23,299
well the attackers out there are not

851
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,160
going to hack your fridge to gain access

852
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,580
to your fridge they're hacking your

853
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:33,290
fridge to gain access to the network

854
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:35,569
behind the fridge IOT devices in most

855
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:38,840
networks are the weakest link in the

856
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:42,740
network this applies both to homes and

857
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:45,020
to companies they go through the weakest

858
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:49,810
link which is an IOT device to gain

859
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,810
access to the network behind the device

860
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,850
this means that one day you might wake

861
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,560
up to realize that every single computer

862
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,140
in your home has been encrypted by a

863
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,130
random Trojan and the attackers got in

864
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:06,080
through your smart doorbell this would

865
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:11,410
be the wake-up call that would make

866
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:13,580
people pay attention on IOT securing

867
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,950
note that hasn't happened yet

868
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:22,009
we haven't seen the real wake-up call

869
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:26,629
yet and the problem with IOT security is

870
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:28,970
that especially for home appliances

871
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,850
price is the most important selling

872
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:34,980
point when you go shopping for a washing

873
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:39,279
machine you're looking at price

874
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:41,110
you're not looking at security features

875
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,540
you're not asking questions about what

876
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,130
kind of a firewall does this washing

877
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,800
machine have No

878
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:51,640
you're asking about price and if that's

879
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:54,550
true that means that vendors creating

880
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,830
these new smart devices can't afford to

881
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,960
invest in security because if they

882
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,700
invest in security the only thing it

883
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,550
does is that it makes their product more

884
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,830
expensive than competitors products and

885
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:13,170
the features they get are features that

886
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:13,170
nobody's asking for they're sort of

887
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:18,790
automatically creating an environment

888
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:24,040
where IOT security sucks

889
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:26,890
an IOT security does suck do you know

890
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,920
how mirror I was spreading he was

891
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:33,910
spreading over telnet you heard me right

892
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,270
telnet nobody uses telnet we've stopped

893
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,690
using telnet in our computers 20 years

894
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:42,030
ago

895
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:46,150
why because telnet is horribly insecure

896
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:48,460
but for some reason apparently we have

897
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,440
to go back and repeat the same mistakes

898
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,200
that we've already fixed in our

899
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:56,200
computers these new IOT devices are

900
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:01,500
repeating the mistakes that we already

901
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:05,350
fixed and this matters because today all

902
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,990
companies are software companies every

903
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:10,569
company is a software company your

904
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:13,540
company is a software company it doesn't

905
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:17,440
matter what you do you're a software

906
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:19,300
company anyway because today the

907
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,480
difference between successful and

908
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:27,400
unsuccessful companies is how good the

909
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,290
company is in digitalization every

910
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,020
company is a software company for

911
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:35,740
example car companies car companies are

912
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:38,280
software companies because what our cars

913
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:43,270
cars our data centers on four wheels

914
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:47,020
that's what they are and for years and

915
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:48,480
years we've been teaching companies to

916
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,259
secure their network like

917
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:55,050
they would be building a safe when

918
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:58,380
you're building a safe you put in really

919
00:51:55,050 --> 00:52:00,630
thick walls and thick door and a good

920
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,560
luck and you try to keep everybody out

921
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,560
all the time

922
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,280
this is what we were preaching secure

923
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:12,480
your network like you would be building

924
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,510
a safe put a strong firewall put some

925
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,030
proxies in there put some filters put

926
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:20,780
some intrusion prevention mechanisms try

927
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:24,840
to keep everybody out all the time and

928
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:27,810
if you build a safe like this if you

929
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,240
build a safe with thick doors thick

930
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:34,320
walls and a good look then you don't

931
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,850
need a motion detector inside the safe

932
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,950
like why would you put a motion detector

933
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:40,080
inside the safe nobody's going to be

934
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:46,259
getting in you don't need a motion

935
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:48,690
detector inside the safe but what if the

936
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,359
attacker figures out a way to get in

937
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,910
that you didn't think about like I don't

938
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,980
know coming in through the ceiling in

939
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,980
that case it actually would be very very

940
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,510
nice to have a motion detector inside to

941
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:06,000
said even though you think you'll never

942
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:08,940
need it so yeah you have to assume that

943
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,010
your safeguards will fail and nobody

944
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,220
likes to do that nobody likes to assume

945
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:16,440
a failure but that's exactly what we

946
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:24,180
should be doing we should be assuming

947
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:26,900
bridge in the networked environment the

948
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:30,750
motion detectors inside your network

949
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:33,750
would be building a picture with sensors

950
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,730
on what's your network looking like and

951
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:38,670
what does normal traffic look like in

952
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:40,920
your network and then when you know what

953
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:46,170
normal looks like then you can start

954
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:49,320
looking for things that are abnormal and

955
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:52,040
these kind of solutions work I know

956
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:55,770
because we we have solutions like this

957
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,140
it's slow work in the beginning we would

958
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:02,070
deploy sensors across the network of a

959
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:03,480
client initially we wouldn't be able to

960
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,390
do anything useful he would just collect

961
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,480
information but after a couple of weeks

962
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:16,230
we have a picture of what normal looks

963
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:18,360
like it doesn't always work though we

964
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:21,900
had one client recently where we

965
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:24,330
detected something that we were

966
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,700
confirmed that we were convinced

967
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:31,020
ourselves that now the company had been

968
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:33,149
hacked because what we saw was that one

969
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:36,180
workstation suddenly woke up at 4:00

970
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,970
a.m. in the morning and started sending

971
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:42,120
gigabytes of data to a static IP address

972
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:44,220
in mainland China so we called up the

973
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,319
company and we reported that we believe

974
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,790
you've been breached and they

975
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,300
investigated the case and then they

976
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:54,900
called us back two days later and they

977
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,420
told us that we were wrong this was a

978
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,270
false alarm

979
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,620
there was no breach they weren't hacked

980
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:04,350
instead what had happened was that they

981
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:06,720
had one employee working on a project

982
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,220
for a Chinese client who had come to

983
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,810
work at 4:00 a.m. in the morning to

984
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:14,359
finish the project and was uploading

985
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:15,840
drawings to a server in China no breach

986
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,980
no hack

987
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:24,360
false alarm however the client was still

988
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:26,730
kind of happy they liked the fact that

989
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,330
we were able to tell that thing was

990
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,800
happening even though it wasn't a bridge

991
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:35,340
it proved to them that the system works

992
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:38,030
and he's able to detect the things that

993
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,030
are abnormal

994
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:49,830
so we've gone from a dream to a

995
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:54,000
nightmare the Internet the Utopia that

996
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:57,560
we were given 25 years ago has been

997
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:04,680
turned into a tool for organized crime

998
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:06,720
for spies and for waging war it has been

999
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:10,950
used to shape people's opinions and to

1000
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:18,870
change the outcome of elections from

1001
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:22,529
dream to a nightmare and this is the

1002
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:26,759
reason why we have to be doing a better

1003
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:29,100
job in securing our networks we have to

1004
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,900
be able to do better security

1005
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:37,560
engineering we have to be able to react

1006
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:40,890
faster to new threats we have to be able

1007
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:46,500
to secure our own networks and our

1008
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:53,490
client networks we have a responsibility

1009
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:57,780
to do that because we all were given a

1010
00:56:53,490 --> 00:57:01,740
free and open Internet that's what we

1011
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:07,740
got and the question is what kind of an

1012
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:09,689
Internet will we be leaving behind what

1013
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:14,930
kind of an Internet will we be giving to

1014
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:18,000
our children what kind of an Internet

1015
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:24,390
are we leaving behind what kind of an

1016
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,780
Internet are you leaving behind thank

1017
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,779
