1
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:10,309
imagine that you're the CEO of the

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,610
business and your company was just hit

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,800
with ransomware imagine that your family

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,560
member

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,170
thank you imagine that one of your

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,960
family members identity was just stolen

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,170
or imagine you just broke up with your

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,840
girlfriend your boyfriend and they

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,469
packed your your phone your computers

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:37,190
they've broken into your accounts who do

11
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:41,420
you turn to law enforcement police

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,218
officers that is the last place that

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,749
most people turn to lately

14
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:50,659
I am a police officer one of the reasons

15
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:53,679
that I started presenting or wanted to

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:56,569
present this is because of that fact

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:00,999
because law enforcement is the last

18
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:00,999
place that somebody wants to turn I

19
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:11,360
started with a tweet this is the simple

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:15,079
tweet that I sent out asking folks if

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,200
they needed my help to contact me it

22
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,020
says if you are a victim of cyber crime

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,200

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,560

and how to protect yourself I am here to

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:45,678

flooded immediately with people asking

31
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:54,380
for my help yeah it got interesting

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:56,859
really quickly so for me as a law

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,979
enforcement officer that breaks my heart

34
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:04,520
because I don't want people to not trust

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:07,969
me law enforcement as their place to

36
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,359
turn to I want them to trust me I want

37
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:13,519
them to come to the police for a place

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,630
to help but there are a lot of reasons

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,160
why they

40
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:23,299
don't so as I said you know this tweets

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:26,750
you can see it got 244 retweets 603

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,800
likes it went that was over two days I

43
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,440
had dozens and dozens of messages in my

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,440
inbox for people saying you know I need

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,180
help how can you help me they didn't

46
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,329
even know how or who to contact here are

47
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,910
some of the statistics on cybercrime

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:49,700
this is by type of crime and you can see

49
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,160
the second one there is personal data

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,850
breaches so somebody has breached your

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,260
personal information and then ransomware

52
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:03,170
and malware towards the end here are

53
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,100
some of the statistics by country you

54
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:13,970
can see China by far has more loss than

55
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:17,930
any other country in 2017 so I'm going

56
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:20,720
to walk you through cybercrime you but

57
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,960
do law enforcement officers have to deal

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,010
with when we're dealing with cybercrime

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:31,820
first of all federal laws this Computer

60
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:37,390
Fraud and Abuse Act CFAA is the primary

61
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:42,380
law by which we govern cybercrime and

62
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:45,920
you this was last amended in 2008 can

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:49,160
you imagine not patching your computer

64
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,089
or making any changes to your computer

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,690
since 2008 that's the same with this law

66
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,650
all of the changes that we've made and

67
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:05,950
all of the growth in cybercrime and yet

68
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,950
we haven't changed this law since 2008

69
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,720
this is one of my recent cases this is a

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:19,070
suspect that I had that I investigated

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:22,220
and he's saying here that this is the

72
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,760
best job in the whole world he's

73
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,070
speaking about cybercrime cyber fraud

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,070
and yet this bottom line

75
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:35,420
says I will take my chances with the

76
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:38,060
feds thank you you cybercriminals know

77
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,510
that law enforcement officers are not

78
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,630
adequate adequately equipped to

79
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:50,060
investigate these crimes so why aren't

80
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:52,430
they the same suspect here Michael Oh

81
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,100
Guinea he stole more than six hundred

82
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,900
and fifty thousand dollars in two years

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:02,090
all credit card fraud skimmers when I

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,479
did the forensics on this case

85
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,810
the one file that he stored everything

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:14,000
in was this bottom one and it's called

87
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:16,130
very big fraud package zip he made it

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,030
very easy for me to find all of the

89
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:25,180
fraud that he was committing Michael

90
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:28,729
Oconee got 14 years in prison 14 years

91
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,020
let's compare that sentence to some

92
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,700
other fraud cases

93
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,169
here are some other sentence are some

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,039
other folks that have been sentenced

95
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:43,850
with 14 years in prison

96
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,550
this first man up here got 14 years in

97
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:51,170
prison for sexually assaulting two

98
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:54,140
children the second one he's an

99
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,990
international drug trafficker he caused

100
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,560
the death the murder in the beatings of

101
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:06,070
hundreds of people and yet he also got

102
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:12,880
14 years in prison all of these crimes

103
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:15,590
five years in prison for hacking Yahoo

104
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,270
14 years in prison for a multi-million

105
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:22,119
dollar money-laundering scheme in which

106
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:24,650
he targeted the elderly in this last one

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,620
convicted fraudster was sentenced for

108
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,770
five years in prison for an 87 million

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,260
dollar Ponzi scheme

110
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,690
how do those relate those aren't even

111
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:41,200
close in the crimes that they've

112
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:43,820
committed and then we can continue

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,800
26 year old hacker was sentenced to

114
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,980
thirty three hundred and thirty four

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,520
years in prison

116
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:57,290
this particular hacker was working with

117
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:01,010
Russian spies and he ended up hacking

118
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,590
several accounts then the yahoo hacker

119
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:08,240
was only sentenced to five years in

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,929
prison and then this recent one here at

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,350
the bottom

122
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,780
a hacker received 14 years in prison

123
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:19,280
just for running the scan for you

124
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:23,210
service so there is a huge discrepancy

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:28,669
in the sentences that we give to hackers

126
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:30,469
and criminals and cybercrime so what is

127
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:34,160
wrong with our current laws and our

128
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:36,890
legal practices our laws are outdated

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,810
they don't reflect what's happening

130
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,380
currently in the trends that are

131
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,550
currently happening the sentences are

132
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,010
subject to the judge who gives them

133
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,890
there's no guideline on what has to be

134
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:55,969
given so that's why we see the wide

135
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:58,640
discrepancies here and then lastly you

136
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,669
most attorneys if I'm working a

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,450
cybercrime case I have to explain to

138
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:09,229
them what a Bitcoin is what an IP

139
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:13,880
address is how do we attribute those to

140
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:18,950
that attacker so technology is not

141
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:22,040
widely understood and then you have

142
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,400
federal jurisdictions that vary on the

143
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,300
amount of crime that they'll take so

144
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,760
some jurisdictions you have to have over

145
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:35,180
$100,000 and theft or loss before they

146
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,419
will even adapt a case some of them it's

147
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:41,900
over 300 thousand dollars can you

148
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,728
imagine having to attribute that amount

149
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:48,520
of loss to some of these cybercrime

150
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:51,350
cases that we see it's very hard

151
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,680
so who investigates cyber crime in the

152
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,720
United States per presidential

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,479
there are two main agencies who

154
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,410
investigate cybercrime the Secret

155
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,420
Service and the FBI there are others

156
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,560
that are able to investigate those as

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,110
well if it falls within their

158
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,339
jurisdiction so you can have immigration

159
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,170
and customs US Postal Service and

160
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:19,640
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms as well as

161
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:22,250
many others here are the types of

162
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,580
cybercrime that some of these agencies

163
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:29,660
investigate so you can see the FBI and

164
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,839
the Secret Service end up investigating

165
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,149
a whole lot of these Postal Inspection

166
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,459
ATF and immigrations and Customs will

167
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,089
get involved if it's in their

168
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,089
jurisdiction

169
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:47,330
so that's on a federal level what about

170
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:53,000
state and local jurisdictions are they

171
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:55,940
able to investigate cyber crime yes so

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,399
local law enforcement you they can

173
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,830
investigate the smaller cases federal

174
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,870
agencies get involved when there are

175
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,830
large account larger cases or if it

176
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,630
crosses state lines so some of the

177
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,830
things that local law enforcement will

178
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:17,140
investigate are harassment stalking

179
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:20,630
child exploitation computer forensics

180
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,459
state law enforcement can investigate

181
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,150
all except for anything involving

182
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:32,359
terrorism and then the federal agencies

183
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:34,370
can investigate everything so we have

184
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,260
the police officers obviously the United

185
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:41,360
States has thousands of police officers

186
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,779
so what kind of training is available

187
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,690
for law enforcement we have a lot of

188
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:50,750
training available free training we have

189
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,640
in CFI the national computer forensics

190
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,640
Institute which is where I was trained

191
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,060
up this is run by the United States

192
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:02,329
Secret Service and they provide this

193
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,479
free for law law enforcement on a local

194
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,969
or state level so they will send local

195
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,540
or state agencies to this training

196
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,260
facility

197
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,510
they will pay for their travel they'll

198
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,150
pay for their hotel they give them a per

199
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,340
diem everyday and they send him home

200
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:24,050
with all of the equipment necessary to

201
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,900
investigate those crimes FLETC or the

202
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,420
federal law enforcement training center

203
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,790
primarily used by the FBI again the same

204
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,040
thing they train local and state law

205
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,900
enforcement and send them home with the

206
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,510
tools necessary to investigate these

207
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,800
crimes

208
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:44,720
then there's NC FTA

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:49,040
and then the nw3 see both of these again

210
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,550
free law enforcement training what's the

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,089
one disconnect in all of this all of

212
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,609
these officers have to go through a law

213
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:02,210
Enforcement Academy when they first

214
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,090
become police officers do you know the

215
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:11,900
one thing that is not taught in the

216
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:17,870
police academy cybercrime is not even

217
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:20,630
touched in the police academy today so

218
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,870
what's the problem we have the officers

219
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,750
we have the training we have the

220
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:30,700
presidential directive that says we can

221
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:35,140
investigate these crimes so what's wrong

222
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,140
why can't we investigate these crimes

223
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,630
here are the four flaws in thinking in

224
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:46,100
the US government and law enforcement

225
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:48,980
one budget most law enforcement agencies

226
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,620
do not have the budget to sustain a

227
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,530
staff member or multiple staff members

228
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:58,760
who are dedicated to just investigate

229
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:02,300
cybercrime most detectives or

230
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,540
investigators even myself we have a

231
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:09,140
full-time caseload above and beyond the

232
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,990
cybercrime that we investigate so I may

233
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,689
investigate theft counterfeiting and

234
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,480
then I may go investigate you know an

235
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,060
incident response or something that's

236
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,490
related to cyber crime so I'm not

237
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,699
specialized in that area so

238
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,650
like most detectives you know they work

239
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,040
a rape they work a homicide and then

240
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:33,470
maybe they can get to cybercrime at some

241
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,810
point although that's very low on their

242
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:43,190
list the second flaw in thinking

243
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:46,790
staffing most agencies are not going to

244
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,130
dedicate that one person like I said but

245
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,829
they're also not willing to send these

246
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,410
officers to that free training that I

247
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,070
just discussed because they can't lose a

248
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:02,390
detective for two weeks four weeks two

249
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,520
months depending on the training so even

250
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,790
though it's free paid for it and it's

251
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,100
going to help their agency they won't

252
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,949
utilize that training because they can't

253
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:19,060
lose that officer the third flaw

254
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:22,910
statistics think about the number of

255
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:27,199
crimes that your average detective can

256
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,209
investigate on a daily basis quite a few

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,030
they may bounce around ten or twelve

258
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,100
different cases you know they're

259
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,839
investigating a bank robbery or they're

260
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,770
investigating a skimmer or they're

261
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,590
investigating you know a local rape they

262
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:46,340
can wrap those cases up a lot quicker

263
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:48,500
than they can a cyber crime case you

264
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,300
have cyber crime cases take awhile you

265
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,880
have to issue subpoenas get the IP

266
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,479
addresses you attribute it to somebody

267
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,430
track you know cryptocurrency

268
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,330
so it takes a while to investigate

269
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:05,810
so statistics play a big part you know

270
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,060
as police officers at the end of the

271
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,030
year our bosses want to know how many

272
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:16,339
cases did you close you know how many

273
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:18,339
crimes did you solve and if I say to my

274
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:22,660
boss is not going to be happy with me

275
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:27,920
and then the fourth flan thinking is

276
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:30,500
command staff you know we have senior

277
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,800
law enforcement officials who barely

278
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,540
know how to turn their own computer on

279
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,500
let alone how to investigate these

280
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,209
crimes

281
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:43,070
so they don't understand the benefit of

282
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:46,280
sending those officers to this training

283
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,680
they don't understand that cybercrime is

284
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:52,040
up and coming and that in the next year

285
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,849
it will probably populate about fifty

286
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,990
percent of what they're investigating

287
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,970
they don't understand that and so

288
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,810
they're not willing to spend the money

289
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:08,150
to utilize the staff and to not worry

290
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:14,739
about those statistics the next big

291
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:18,650
issue nerds and cops we don't mix right

292
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,810
usually you know if you are into

293
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,480
computers and you want to investigate

294
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,270
computer crimes or you want to work on

295
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,660
computers your first thought is not

296
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:32,470
going to the police academy and on the

297
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,020
flip side most law enforcement officers

298
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:39,080
do not set out in their career to

299
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,510
investigate cyber crime you know that's

300
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,050
that's not that's not the fun thing to

301
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,730
investigate you know they want to go

302
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,310
investigate the homicides the bank

303
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:56,510
robbery is the fun stuff as they say

304
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:58,760
cyber crime is not fun to most people so

305
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,650
let's talk about the process you know

306
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:05,300
when we go out to investigate a cyber

307
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:08,119
crime as law enforcement officers we are

308
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:12,619
trained to investigate cyber crime as a

309
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:17,179
cop we're trained to go out gather the

310
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:19,189
evidence and leave we forget that there

311
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,520
are real people and real emotions

312
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,280
involved and so we are not trained to

313
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,160
speak to the employees to give them the

314
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,760
next steps to talk about what's going to

315
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,530
happen and who they should call next

316
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,200
because I'm not going to go in and fix

317
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:40,250
their system they have to have somebody

318
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,400
that does that and so we don't discuss

319
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:47,510
you know do you contact the news media

320
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,550
or why that's bad you know what's going

321
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,240
to happen to your system next what

322
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,100
should you do

323
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,090
who should you call we're not used to

324
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:58,340
doing that and so our first impressions

325
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,490
when we go on to a scene for cybercrime

326
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,850
are usually pretty bad they're worried

327
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,410
about business and whether or not their

328
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,790
business is going to be back up and

329
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,100
running that day because they're losing

330
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,820
money with every hour that their system

331
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:18,520
is down so our first impressions are

332
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:23,600
usually really bad so as law enforcement

333
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:29,059
how do we create that trust what can we

334
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:33,409
do to help folks want to come to us when

335
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:36,050
there's a cyber crime attack we have to

336
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,660
rethink as law enforcement how we do

337
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:42,190
things and this is not unique with

338
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:45,260
cybercrime I think that we've lost

339
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,750
perspective as law enforcement on why

340
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:53,300
we're here and why we investigate these

341
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:55,070
things it has to be a top-down change so

342
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,520
it has to come from the command staff

343
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,100
and command staff down has to understand

344
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,290
that this is a priority that this is

345
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,840
going to be a big deal and we need to

346
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:12,460
spend the time in the manpower to fix

347
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:17,059
this so what about the private sector

348
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,400
why are we not utilizing them you know I

349
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,399
have lots of friends who work in threat

350
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,179
intelligence and every single one of

351
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,830
them have told me that not once have

352
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:31,940
they worked with law enforcement on a

353
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:34,428
case typically it's them giving law

354
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,170
enforcement information and then law

355
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:39,070
enforcement says thanks and see you

356
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:43,250
later and they never see him again

357
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,379
that's unacceptable we should be

358
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,450
utilizing the private sector more as law

359
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:53,270
enforcement the private sector excels at

360
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,330
law enforcement if you listen to me COEs

361
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:59,780
talked this morning the stuff that he

362
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,960
was saying is exactly what law

363
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,379
enforcement should be thinking about but

364
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,380
we don't

365
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:11,600
you they give their people incentives

366
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:15,109
they specialize in areas country's

367
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,539
threat actors they understand the

368
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:20,899
processes and procedures because they

369
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:25,059
employ people who specialize in each of

370
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:27,889
these areas they give these people money

371
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:31,190
that law-enforcement officers don't get

372
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:32,869
so most law enforcement officers like

373
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,789
myself you know obviously I'm not in

374
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:39,918
this for the money government pay but at

375
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:42,889
some point you most law enforcement

376
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,590
officers will transfer over to the

377
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:48,498
private sector because the money is

378
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,728
better over there we cannot keep people

379
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:56,299
in government positions without

380
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:58,429
incentivizing them to be there the

381
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:01,729
private sector also has specialized

382
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:04,909
teams they have up-to-date hardware and

383
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:07,820
software you know this is something the

384
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:10,729
government doesn't have we don't update

385
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,970
our systems our laptops our software our

386
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:17,960
hardware and if I want a specialized

387
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,879
program to investigate cyber crime it's

388
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,599
like pulling teeth to get that program

389
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:25,570
to get somebody to spend that money

390
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:33,499
which is hard so I end up going to

391
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:35,960
open-source tools this is a paper that

392
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:38,779
the DoD released it's called strategy

393
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,450
for operating on cyberspace and with

394
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:44,840
this the military is saying we need to

395
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:48,169
partner with other agencies and the

396
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,779
private sector how many of you in the

397
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:54,049
private sector have ever partnered with

398
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:57,289
law enforcement on a case before and not

399
00:21:54,049 --> 00:22:00,729
just given them information but actually

400
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:05,769
collaborated on how to solve a problem

401
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:05,769
this should be a greater priority for us

402
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:13,489
partnerships how can we form that

403
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:16,939
lasting partnership like I said you know

404
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:17,779
in law enforcement we are so bad about

405
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,330
just

406
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:23,210
taking the information and not giving

407
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,340
back so in order to provide these

408
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,219
partnerships and make them lasting

409
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,218
partnerships we're going to have to

410
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:33,799
collaborate you know I would love to sit

411
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:37,009
down at a table with a group of private

412
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:40,639
sector folks companies and learn more

413
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:43,249
about threat actor groups and where that

414
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:53,899
can help my investigations but it's just

415
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:56,359
unheard of so in closing there has to be

416
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:59,928
a fundamental shift in thinking about

417
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:06,468
cybercrime you know we really have to

418
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:09,830
work at getting that top-down change we

419
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:14,659
have to make sure that people understand

420
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:17,449
that this is a priority you know in the

421
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:20,029
UK which is where we see most of the

422
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,239
cybercrime hit in the before it hits the

423
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:25,039
United States they're seen over 50% of

424
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:28,190
their cases are cyber crime related

425
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,169
already so it's only a matter of time

426
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:38,749
before that hits the same percentage

427
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:43,129
across the world you know you can help

428
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:45,529
change this process we all have to get

429
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:49,459
involved we all have to make those

430
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:52,759
changes so you in the United States we

431
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,909
go to our congressmen we go to you our

432
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:58,249
senators and ask them to change the laws

433
00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:01,369
we're gonna have to change the laws

434
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:04,489
we're gonna have to change the processes

435
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:09,678
in which you this occurs we have to

436
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:11,749
change that CFAA and then the private

437
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,570
sector and law enforcement we have to

438
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:18,559
create a lasting partnership for the

439
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:21,320
greater good you know this is something

440
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,809
that we all have to work at so if you're

441
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,269
in the private sector and you have a

442
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,940
chance to reach out to your local law

443
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:32,020
enforcement you'll reach out and then in

444
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,700
the same respect the task force that I'm

445
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,740
we are constantly reaching out to

446
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,220
private sector folks and asking them to

447
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,580
come in and teach at our task force

448
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:46,220
meetings we want to hear from the

449
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,760
private sector and so you know we're

450
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,610
trying to make that established

451
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,629
connection with private sector in my

452
00:24:52,610 --> 00:25:00,219
area and I'm hoping that others will too

453
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,220
so we can all learn from each other

454
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:16,490
we have to stop worrying about those

455
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:22,080
statistics as law enforcement we're so

456
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:24,090
focused on the next big bust you know

457
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,289
where did we get that million dollars

458
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:33,510
worth of cocaine from you know who was

459
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:35,490
able to bust that drug ring we have to

460
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:39,600
stop focusing on that and focus more on

461
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:42,270
cybercrime cases and you not worrying

462
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,649
about the short-term picture murrain

463
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:49,049
more about the long-term picture we need

464
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:51,629
dedicated units one of the reasons that

465
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:54,690
I was so excited to speak here today is

466
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,179
because I believe Japan is doing it

467
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,360
right

468
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,250
Tokyo Metro Police have a dedicated unit

469
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,250
with hundreds of law enforcement

470
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:09,570
officers specifically dedicated to

471
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,980
cybercrime that's amazing to me that is

472
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,139
something that needs to be done

473
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:19,200
everywhere and should be done you have

474
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,570
to focus those units we have the ability

475
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,820
in the United States to do that like I

476
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,360
said all of these folks that the Secret

477
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,990
Service and the FBI trains are mostly

478
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,979
local and state law enforcement officers

479
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,899
we could start task force in our state's

480
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,899
you know multi-state jurisdictional task

481
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:41,879
forces but we haven't done that yet

482
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:44,340
we're really bad about collaborating in

483
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,590
the United States so I was really

484
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:51,059
excited to hear that Japan does that you

485
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,949
know and like I said earlier most

486
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,870
officers are so tied up on the other

487
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:58,080
cases that they don't get the chance to

488
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:01,080
investigate cyber crime cases if you can

489
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,809
close ten other cases in the time that

490
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,789
you could one cyber crime case they're

491
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:07,889
gonna go for the ten cases because they

492
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:10,408
know at the end of the day their boss is

493
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,630
going to look at those statistics and be

494
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:18,870
happier with the ten cases versus the

495
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:23,460
one case I started noticing that this

496
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:26,039
was a big issue and so I ended up

497
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,889
developing a training course for law

498

widely accepted and I've trained over

506
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:57,179

509
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,339
