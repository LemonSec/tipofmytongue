1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,780
hello and good morning everybody

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:11,190
thank you very much for coming to this

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,139
talk and thank you very much to the

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,930
conference organizing and to the great

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,839
conference team have put such a such an

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,419
amazing event together and I hope you

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,369
guys had some good and very strong

8
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:24,599
coffee this morning because this topic

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,519
might be a bit boring

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:32,910
so just getting to make it a bit lighter

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:35,839
so let's get let's get started why this

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,050
topic why do we need to talk about

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,469
security in IT contracts and especially

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,578
why do we need to do this as security

15
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,769
professionals well there are two sides

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,899
to the security there is the very

17
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:55,260
interesting technical part and we have

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,929
seen many talks at this conference with

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,440
many exploits new new techniques and

20
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:04,519
this is all very nice and fun but we

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,390
also have our day to day jobs and

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,400
especially in today's economy where

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,729
everything is connected where we have so

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,060
many interdependencies between multiple

25
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,060
organizations we deal one way or another

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,880
with contracts and with the consequences

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,689
of IT contracts in general on a daily

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,170
basis you are actually more likely to

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:32,669
have to deal with a contract than with

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:37,469
an actual security bridge and this is

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,420
why we have to we have to do it and it's

32
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,219
also very important for us as security

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,700
professionals with the organizations

34
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,380
that we work for to pay attention to how

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,289
security is put into IT contracts

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,140
because if we if we don't do it right

37
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:54,450
then we will end up spending a lot of

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,420
time dealing with escalation is dealing

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,310
with contractual breaches and that will

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,500
prevent us first of all from doing the

41
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,530
jobs that we like from working on the

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,659
threat hunting on doing the research

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,250
that we like or working with the

44
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,660
firewalls and the interest acuity

45
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,430
infrastructure and securing the cloud

46
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,680
and all the good start that work that we

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,970
like and I'm sure that you guys prefer

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,970
to do that

49
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:21,120
and to deal with contractual escalations

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:24,720
and of course if we don't do it right we

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,690
put our companies at risk and what I'm

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,030
trying to Train still through the talk

53
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,190
today is the idea that we as security

54
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,950
professionals have to play a bigger role

55
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,200
in how IT contracts and not just

56
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:41,940
security contracts all IT contracts are

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,290
being are being written a few words

58
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,960
about myself

59
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,750
I'm Sebastian of our Valley I work as

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,080
director for security advisory services

61
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,200
at Wolters Kluwer in Europe I have been

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,810
in an IT and security for over 20 years

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,399
and during this time I have dealt with

64
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,160
more contracts than I care to remember

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,650
and I have seen those contracts from

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,230
various sides I've I've been developer I

67
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,560
have been a consultant I have been an

68
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,540
architect I have been an auditor and

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,810
this way I gain different perspectives

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,850
on contract and I have also suffered

71
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,650
from a lot of the consequences of the

72
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,100
problems that I'm going to talk about

73
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,200
today I fortunately I came from a

74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,579
technical background and I'm therefore

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,768
able to understand the technical side of

76
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,860
things but I also learned to appreciate

77
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,709
the importance of security management on

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,690
security governance and understanding

79
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,140
the business side and the business

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:44,190
implications of security and not in the

81
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,839
list I'm I'm a great fan of the InfoSec

82
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,200
community I think it's a community where

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,620
we really put our step forward and we do

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,720
a lot of work not only to secure things

85
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,850
but also to share our knowledge and

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,160
events like like this conference are a

87
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:04,010
great example how we can help each other

88
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,560
how we can learn from from each other

89
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:11,190
now to start with the with the topic and

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,370
to start with the original scene the

91
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,790
real root of all evils where where do

92
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:23,070
most problems start in IT contract and

93
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,720
security we don't put always security in

94
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,390
those contracts I

95
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,840
it's maybe today a bit less prevalent

96
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,210
that it used to be but I still see many

97
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,520
contracts where security is either

98
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:41,729
completely missing or just mentioned

99
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:46,830
somewhere at has a footnote and what

100
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,210
happens when we do that if we don't put

101
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,460
security in the contract from the

102
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,250
beginning it's always difficult and you

103
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,320
have to actually fight to get it done

104
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,210
later because once the contract is

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,740
signed it's always very difficult to to

106
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,510
change so you have to think about

107
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,160
security in advance and this applies to

108
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,219
everything in security we know very well

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,230
for anything that we do if we don't plan

110
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,460
for security from the beginning like in

111
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,680
an application if you don't design

112
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,169
security in the application from the

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,850
start it's much much more difficult to

114
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,980
do it later and we have to put security

115
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,630
in the contracts not just for the

116
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,900
security itself today security is just

117
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:31,409
another quality aspect of IT every IT

118
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,859
service every IT product must have

119
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,710
security as a quality aspect and any

120
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,440
quality aspect that you want to get from

121
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,479
your supplier you put it in the contract

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,570
if you want to have a certain uptime

123
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,610
before your infrastructure you mention

124
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,940
that in the contract likewise if you

125
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,500
want to have secure security in the

126
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,330
product that you're buying or in the

127
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,180
services that the supplier is providing

128
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:02,820
for you you have to mention that in the

129
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:05,430
contract and remember anything that you

130
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,730
don't put in the contract you don't get

131
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,190
it

132
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,410
nobody does things for free or except

133
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,140
for very few volunteering organisations

134
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,240
but in the commercial world if it's not

135
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,310
in the contract you will not get it if

136
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,770
you don't require security in the

137
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:25,080
contract you will not get that security

138
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,900
now moving to the net to the next

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,859
problem and continuing with the that

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,690
would start start reverse theme yeah I

141
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,610
have to warn you there are going to be a

142
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,710
lot of movie references in this

143
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,460
presentation don't worry if you don't

144
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,830
get them

145
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,210
or it simply means that we have

146
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,219
healthier lifestyle than I do and you

147
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:48,450
don't spend so much time as I do in

148
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,940
front of in front of a TV screen but as

149
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,409
you remember after the first Star Wars

150
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,660
read oh gee we have the Phantom Menace

151
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,470
well this is what I call the Phantom

152
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,830
clothes manners it's something you see

153
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,260
quite often in many contracts this the

154
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,039
famous statement the supplier shall

155
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:11,969
follow the customer security policies

156
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:14,580
which sounds good in theory what could

157
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,590
what could be wrong with this well why

158
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,310
is it the Menace

159
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,919
well its manners because very few

160
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:27,540
contracts very few companies are doing

161
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:30,420
it right first of all I haven't seen

162
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,750
many contracts actually specifying what

163
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,450
are the security policies we work in

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,800
different organizations and we have we

165
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:43,020
have seen that security policies is more

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,720
often than not a very large set of

167
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,609
documents and everybody uses different

168
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,530
names you know security policies

169
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,280
security guidelines security standards

170
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:57,150
and you have to specify in the contract

171
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,320
what are the actual documents which make

172
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:05,810
up your security policies most contracts

173
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,460
don't even specify the versions what is

174
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,780
the security policy version that the

175
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,310
contract is based on where do you get

176
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,010
those security policies you're your

177
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,050
supplier you have signed a new contract

178
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,880
with them with a customer and the

179
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,150
customer tells you that you have to be

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,740
compliant with their security policies

181
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,479
do you have an agreement of where

182
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,970
exactly do you get those security

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:35,340
policies when you don't have these clear

184
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,770
specifications in the contract this

185
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,350
leads to a lot of problems and I will

186
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,360
try to give to give examples through

187
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:45,000
this talk of course I will not disclose

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,950
any any names but these are cases that

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,610
have actually happened I remember a case

190
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,430
with a high it was a telco company

191
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,980
which had a very extensive set of

192
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,829
security policies very well returned

193
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,430
very detailed they covered a lot of

194
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:05,949
things and in those security policies

195
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,560
one small problem they never mentioned

196
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,959
those policies specifically in the

197
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,719
contract and that company had a lot of

198
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,479
suppliers they're changing suppliers

199
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,570
regularly they were doing new contracts

200
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,170
and the security team of that customer

201
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,589
spent a huge amount of time with each

202
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,670
supplier dealing with escalations

203
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,579
stemming from the fact that the

204
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,189
suppliers were not aware of those

205
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:35,469
security policies and they had to do the

206
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,329
same things over and over again same

207
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,890
discussions yes we have this in the

208
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,979
security forms is yes we have to do it

209
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,350
this way not your way it's a problem

210
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,540
that could have been very easily solved

211
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,610
by putting those specifications in the

212
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,829
contract what are the security policies

213
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:56,920
which versions were to get them from now

214
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:58,810
let's say you have done the contract you

215
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,860
have worked with your contract team as

216
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,380
security professionals you have

217
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,320
convinced them to put explicitly which

218
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,589
security policies documents have to be

219
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,510
part of the contract what happens when

220
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,970
you get a new version because we do

221
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,670
change our security policies and most

222
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,430
companies have at least an yearly cycle

223
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,010
when they review and update the policies

224
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,599
to deal with the would new security

225
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,439
threats to keep up with the developments

226
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:30,550
in the industry who pays for those

227
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:35,470
changes and this is one of the things

228
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:38,170
that you need to plan in advance for you

229
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,540
need to put in the contract at least a

230
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,310
requirement that such procedures for

231
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,550
dealing with changes in the policies

232
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,619
have to exist you don't want to leave

233
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,069
that open because that's going to be a

234
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,470
few months of negotiations between

235
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:56,740
between the supplier and the customer at

236
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,260
every policy change think about putting

237
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,800
that procedural requirement in the

238
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,180
contract from the beginning and make

239
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,790
sure that

240
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,319
you have some agreements in place about

241
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,050
who is going to pay for those changes

242
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,250
because changes in security policies can

243
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,359
be sometimes expensive they might go

244
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:20,260
outside the normal scope over the

245
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,570
contract and you don't want to have over

246
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,950
and over again this cars about now I

247
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,630
don't want to pay for this because I

248
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,190
have the contract with you the supplier

249
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,370
says now but this is something different

250
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,279
from what we agreed and it all comes

251
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,880
down to the money you have to think

252
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,899
about about these things and I remember

253
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,060
a case with a manufacturing company they

254
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:46,029
they had a security policy and they

255
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,099
updated one year and they introduced

256
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,200
through the Polish through the security

257
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,649
policies a very good requirement that

258
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,130
every major change in the IT systems

259
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:59,680
every every major project in IT must

260
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,620
have a very extensive risk assessment

261
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,949
perform and the supplier of that project

262
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,529
needs to provide a very comprehensive

263
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,900
set of risk analysis documents with

264
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:15,490
everything as quantified as possible

265
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:17,860
with that meant hundreds and even

266
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,380
thousands of extra hours of work for for

267
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,740
their suppliers that was work that was

268
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,050
not planned before and now those

269
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,880
companies instead of actually doing the

270
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,800
work that they wanted wanted to do

271
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,390
instead of working on the actual project

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:37,089
spend time dealing with the endless

273
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:41,080
discussions about financial terms and

274
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:42,910
how do we do how do we solve this and by

275
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,900
there you will see in some of the

276
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,230
contracts you will see the term

277
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,990
imposition of costs that's the legal

278
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,320
term that you have to use in the in the

279
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:56,440
contract to specify who is responsible

280
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,010
for paying for things because contracts

281
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,010
are about money

282
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,859
another problem that I see oh you have

283
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,358
written a contract and you have put all

284
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,279
the details in there you've thought

285
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:13,649
about procedures you are prepared to

286
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,199
deal with the changes and you know

287
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:22,879
exactly which policies you have to

288
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,878
comply with have you actually read them

289
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:29,579
you would be surprised in how many

290
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:32,429
contracts and I'm talking about large

291
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:35,910
contracts in millions and tens of

292
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:39,480
veneers and more where it turned out

293
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,439
that nobody actually read the security

294
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,730
policies before signing the contract

295
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:46,679
nobody actually you know they accepted

296
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,359
that the security policies have to be

297
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,059
followed they are part of the contractor

298
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:53,609
requirement but nobody in the supplier

299
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:58,199
side have actually read those security

300
00:13:53,609 --> 00:14:00,779
policies and in most contracts you have

301
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,779
or you should have a phase called due

302
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,639
diligence that that's when you you know

303
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,100
get to know your business partner you

304
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,160
get some insight into the activities you

305
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:14,339
find out how reliable or trustworthy

306
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,509
your business partner is part of that

307
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:20,489
understanding of your business partner

308
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:23,910
should be understanding their security

309
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:29,489
policies you have to actually read them

310
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:32,249
and you and you as security team have to

311
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:34,799
be involved in that process and not

312
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:36,720
involved as in let's just do a

313
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,249
rubber-stamp and approve this two days

314
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,100
before signing the contract now you have

315
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:43,799
to you have to actually go through the

316
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,929
security policies and if there is

317
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,299
anything that you think might be a risk

318
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:50,189
for your company something that you

319
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:54,119
might not be able to deliver or

320
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:56,579
something that might impact the costs of

321
00:14:54,119 --> 00:15:00,419
the services or the products that you

322
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,789
are delivering you have to flag that you

323
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:06,359
have you are the ones as security

324
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:08,220
professionals who can understand the

325
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:10,019
actual requirements in the security

326
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,839
policies which are part of the contract

327
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,290
and translate that to to the business

328
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,089
business colleagues

329
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,130
you have to explain them this is what

330
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:25,269
happens if we agree if we agree to these

331
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:28,350
security policies example I saw a

332
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,329
contract with a very large financial

333
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:35,230
organization they decided to outsource

334
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:38,800
the infrastructure it was I think close

335
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:43,540
to two or three hundred million euros

336
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,508
very large contract and the and the

337
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,969
outsourcing party was happy they started

338
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:51,339
to work they started to design the whole

339
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,130
new infrastructure within the network

340
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:56,230
the data storage everything how the sir

341
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,610
how everything will be virtualized move

342
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,899
to the cloud how everything will look

343
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,509
like what they didn't do they didn't

344
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:06,910
read the policies and they didn't notice

345
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:08,880
that in the policies for that customer

346
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,560
they had a very strict requirement that

347
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,959
they have to follow the principle of

348
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,319
micro segment micro segmentation in

349
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,939
network design so after they finalize

350
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:23,740
the design phase and they were already

351
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,300
buying the product they the systems that

352
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,930
they needed to run the infrastructure

353
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,880
for that client they went to the sink to

354
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:33,459
the customer for approval the customer

355
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:38,350
showed the design to the security team

356
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:40,689
and the security team said no all those

357
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,670
month months of work have to be scrapped

358
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:46,990
away all the designs start from scratch

359
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:51,430
equipment that was order has had to be

360
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,110
returned and actually it was one of the

361
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,769
factors that contributed to that

362
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:59,769
contract to be to be broken and when you

363
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:02,410
break a contract on this level it's

364
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:05,470
terribly expensive and terribly damaging

365
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,530
for both companies both for the supplier

366
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,319
who has lost a lot of money and has lost

367
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,149
reputation but also for for the customer

368
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,609
so even if you are working for a

369
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,610
customer that is a problem for you as

370
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,099
well because everything gets put on hold

371
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:24,668
everything is delayed with a year or

372
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:27,909
more and all those strategic programs

373
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:31,120
that you are working on are delayed

374
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,370
so make sure you actually read the

375
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,590
security policies and if you are on the

376
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,530
customer side make sure that you ask

377
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,350
your supplier have you read my security

378
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:47,710
policies do you actually understand what

379
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:50,159
do you need to comply with now I've been

380
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,590
talking about what I don't see

381
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,250
sufficiently enough in contract let me

382
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:59,290
tell you about one thing that I see and

383
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,530
I don't like to see it's something that

384
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,810
it keeps repeated and I don't want to

385
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:08,139
see it anymore

386
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:10,149
best practices we see this sentence

387
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,940
being very frequently used in contracts

388
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,610
the supplier should follow industry best

389
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,950
practice or the supplier shall follow

390
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,290
security best practices yeah best

391
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,210
practices are good you know when you're

392
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,580
talking in abstract you're when you're

393
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,610
talking it's a feel-good kind of

394
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:31,030
statement it doesn't belong in a

395
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:36,689
contract contract is about details and

396
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,690
as we know the devil is in the details

397
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:44,129
if you do want to have some best

398
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:46,060
practices of referenced in the contract

399
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,450
there are some good examples out there

400
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,250
but be specific I mean I enumerated a

401
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,370
few them on the on the slide you have a

402
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,710
lot you have some very good best

403
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:00,100
practices from all of us from Microsoft

404
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,200
from nice and you can find actual best

405
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,209
practices for pretty much everything you

406
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,990
want but make sure you actually

407
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,290
enumerate them in the contract make sure

408
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:13,540
that you have a common understanding

409
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:19,629
with your business partner about what is

410
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:21,190
actually a best practice example I was

411
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,760
involved in in a contract many years ago

412
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,380
and everything was going well and here

413
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,230
we got it and we got to the

414
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,240
implementation phase and we started to

415
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,170
discuss with the security team from from

416
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,670
the customer and they had they had an

417
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,460
understanding of what is best practice

418
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,600
for encryption which which they took to

419
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,320
be 2048

420
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,179
beat for encryption keys on our cider

421
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,720
supplier we were still on the standard

422
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,180
that 1024 24-bit is sufficient as I told

423
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,910
it was some time ago when we're still

424
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,590
transitioning from 1024 2048 beating

425
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:02,630
entry from keys and it wasn't just

426
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:06,139
theoretical abstract problem the problem

427
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,790
was that being able to work with the

428
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,580
with the longer encryption keys required

429
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:14,060
a lot of upgrades a lot of extra work

430
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:18,139
that we as suppliers have to do requires

431
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:22,669
in many cases to upgrade certain certain

432
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,740
pieces of hardware that that was a very

433
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,780
significant financially difference

434
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,430
between between our positions and it's

435
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,290
something that because it was not clear

436
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,660
in the contract what is the best

437
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,940
practice we could have referenced maybe

438
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,310
to the to the OS best practices for

439
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,130
encryption as as the baseline and we'd

440
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:43,639
have a common common standard because we

441
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,980
didn't do that we had to spend a lot of

442
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,850
time in the negotiations and yeah I

443
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,370
agree

444
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:53,379
kind of with you but I don't quite want

445
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,379
to do it because it's it's too expensive

446
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:03,740
another thing similar with the best

447
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,800
practices we see quite often in the

448
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,410
contract statements like the supplier

449
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,190
shall be compliant and you have all

450
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:14,960
kinds of regulations either for you for

451
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,220
specific industries or general ones you

452
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:23,420
have ISO PCI DSS gdpr needs to or we

453
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:26,350
have banking regulations and those are

454
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,110
listed in the contract and it says that

455
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:35,780
the supplier has to has to be compliant

456
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:38,479
with that well I have also seen that in

457
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:42,639
many situations the suppliers don't

458
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,640
actually know what those regulations are

459
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,070
they do not understand what are the

460
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,130
implications of those requirements from

461
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,720
from the regulations and the standards

462
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,200
that they said that they are going to be

463
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,200
compliant with

464
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,580
also I've seen many contracts where they

465
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,340
don't specify what is the scope of

466
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,929
applicability for certain for a certain

467
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,159
standard and if you take something like

468
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:12,860
PCI DSS and you have you have outsourced

469
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,890
to your infrastructure it doesn't mean

470
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,689
that all your infrastructure has to be

471
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:21,440
PCI DSS it doesn't mean that the

472
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,560
supplier has to has to be PCI DSS

473
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,020
compliant for everything no they have to

474
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,149
be PCI DSS compliant just for the

475
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,720
systems which are in scope and likewise

476
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:35,000
with gdpr with with hepa you have to be

477
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,330
specific what is the scope of

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,700
applicability for every regulations and

479
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:46,310
framework that you require if you are on

480
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,550
the supplier side if you are working as

481
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:54,050
a security professional for a supplier

482
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:56,540
of IT services you have to check with

483
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,120
your actual delivery teams if they can

484
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,210
deliver to that standard you are the

485
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,530
ones who have to do the translation

486
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,900
between that security regulation to

487
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:13,580
actual deliverable items that they have

488
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,710
to provide also on the customer side so

489
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,770
if you're working on the security team

490
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,080
of the customer you have to make sure

491
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,410
that you collect the necessary

492
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,629
regulations from all the stakeholders

493
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:30,650
you have to actually go to the business

494
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:32,360
divisions and ask them for your part of

495
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,850
the business what do you have to be

496
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,100
compliant with are you doing something

497
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,139
with medical systems do we have to

498
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,040
require our supplier to be HIPAA

499
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:46,730
compliant PCI DSS gdpr do we work with

500
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,730
European data ok you have to make sure

501
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:54,260
that you collect all those details from

502
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:56,810
from all the stakeholders because as I

503
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,700
said earlier if you don't put all your

504
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,580
requirements in the contracts from the

505
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,960
beginning it's much more expensive and

506
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,960
difficult to change it later

507
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,529
just as I mentioned with the with the

508
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,199
security policies

509
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:15,559
remember that regulations also change

510
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,029
from time to time we had recently a new

511
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,279
version of PCI DSS

512
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:21,740
we had a new regulation called GDP are

513
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,100
being introduced make sure you have some

514
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:28,130
provisions in the contract how do you

515
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:31,010
deal with changes in the regulatory

516
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,500
framework we yep just like with the

517
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,490
security policies who pays for the

518
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:40,000
changes who is responsible for for the

519
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,230
implementation of new policies even the

520
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,630
assessment of determining the

521
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,600
implications of introducing a new

522
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,909
regulation even that is when a

523
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,678
non-trivial amount of work that should

524
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:58,010
be quantified in financial terms

525
00:24:51,679 --> 00:25:01,190
somewhere in the contract and as an

526
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:03,950
example I remember a case with with

527
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,289
somebody working in Switzerland in

528
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,299
Switzerland they have some very strict

529
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:12,429
banking regulations there's a regulation

530
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:16,010
called called fin ma which puts a lot of

531
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:19,070
details about how Dayton needs to be

532
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,289
handled how it has to be encrypted who

533
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,980
is authorized to touch customer data can

534
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:28,460
you can give access to non-swiss

535
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:33,049
partners to your data it's quite it's

536
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,840
quite a good regulation but in in one

537
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:38,090
case the supplier didn't quite pay

538
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,070
attention didn't read all the details of

539
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,840
the fema they signed the contract sir

540
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,178
yeah okay we're going to deliver your

541
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,459
your IT services we're going to provide

542
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:49,750
you with data storage and they've

543
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:52,960
actually bought very nice devices

544
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,590
ignoring the fact that FEMA requires

545
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,960
storage data encryption and they had to

546
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,279
throw away those devices buy new more

547
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,799
expensive ones which are more expensive

548
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,529
than what they foreseen in the contract

549
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,799
again they're very expensive mistake and

550
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:12,740
a mistake that also delayed the the

551
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:15,020
contract its soured the relation between

552
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,779
the the customer and the supplier and

553
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,700
you don't want to bet to get on the bad

554
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:25,940
side of

555
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:30,260
banking institution and speaking of

556
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:32,090
compliance we say them the customer also

557
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,650
the supplier shall be compliant with

558
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,649
this and that and of course between

559
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:40,250
business partners we trust each other's

560
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:44,000
we we trust our business partners but we

561
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,580
always verify and this is something that

562
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,670
I learned when I was working as auditor

563
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,710
always trust but very fine it's like

564
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,440
it's like Santa Claus he's making the

565
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,860
list he's checking it twice and we have

566
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,900
to do the same thing in security we have

567
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,740
to check everything and if possible

568
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,780
check it and check it twice why because

569
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,200
if we don't check things security

570
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,510
becomes full of surprises and security

571
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,350
is an area where you don't like

572
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,160
surprises

573
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:19,129
you we don't want to have security

574
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,400
surprises you you want to know exactly

575
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:29,120
what kind of chocolate are you going to

576
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:31,970
get from that security box and how do

577
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,760
you how do you solve this with a number

578
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:38,210
of things first of all if you say that

579
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,340
the supplier has to be compliant with

580
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:43,460
the certain regulations or with with a

581
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,889
certain framework make sure that you

582
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,230
also include in the contract

583
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:51,740
requirements that they have to to

584
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:54,140
provide actual compliance statements

585
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,570
that they have to prove to you on an

586
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,660
ongoing basis that they're still

587
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,490
compliant with that regulation okay if

588
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,250
it's something like a requirement for

589
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,680
so2 compliance you have to put in the

590
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:10,190
contract that the supplier is obligated

591
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:15,520
to provide you their yearly shock to

592
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:18,320
compliance report also very important

593
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,139
put metrics about security in the

594
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:27,070
contract it's something that I very

595
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:30,320
rarely see and in IT in the general IT

596
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:33,780
they are more advanced than we are in

597
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,780
security if you look at at the IT part

598
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:40,290
of a contract you find a lot of SL A's

599
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:43,230
and KP is it have a lot of actual

600
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:46,379
measurable measurable definitions about

601
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:49,980
how the quality of the IT service is

602
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,740
being measured what did I say in the

603
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,700
beginning security is just another

604
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:59,580
quality aspect of IT therefore it should

605
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,830
be very measurable and there are some

606
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,770
very good books and some very good

607
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,720
materials on metrics for the security

608
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:10,110
field there are metrics for pretty much

609
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,260
anything you can imagine in security the

610
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:17,510
only thing we need to do is to actually

611
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,510
specify those metrics in the contract

612
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,460
next to that make sure that in your

613
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,310
contracts for IT services you have

614
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:31,140
specific requirements for auditing and

615
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:33,690
for pen testing we do it but not

616
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:38,280
sufficiently well and I will get into

617
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:41,040
that topic a bit more and for all those

618
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,460
points for the compliance reporting for

619
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,600
the metrics for the the pen testing and

620
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:53,190
auditing you have to answer in the

621
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:56,340
contract - for questions who how sorry

622
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:00,090
that's three questions who how and how

623
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,610
often who is going to do it who is going

624
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,770
to actually send the compliance reports

625
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:09,990
who is going to do the pen testing who

626
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:12,000
is going to measure things how how is it

627
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,650
going to be measured how is it going to

628
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,790
be audited how is it going to be pen

629
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:21,030
tested and how often how often do you

630
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,129
need to get those reports how often do

631
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:28,250
you get pen tested how often do you

632
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:32,220
measure the security essays and KPIs

633
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:35,100
of course when we say that we need to

634
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,930
have the pen tests and audits in the

635
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:43,350
contract it doesn't mean that everything

636
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:46,200
goes they have to be limits we have to

637
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,980
define in the contract both if we are on

638
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,990
the

639
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,350
customer and all the supplier sign what

640
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:55,260
are the boundaries for pen tests and

641
00:30:52,350 --> 00:31:01,439
audits what is allowed and what do we

642
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:03,750
say nope you will not do that on the

643
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,299
auditing side things are usually a bit

644
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,549
better because auditing requirements in

645
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:10,799
the contracts are written usually with

646
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:12,629
the support of the guys from from the

647
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,760
legal and from the auditing Department

648
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,220
and they have a bit more experience than

649
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,290
we do in writing things in contracts and

650
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,540
we could actually learn a thing or two

651
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,879
from them but when it comes to write to

652
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:27,299
audit you have to specify in the

653
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,049
contract the the frequency of the audits

654
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:33,570
how much notice as auditing party do we

655
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:36,750
need to give to the other party how much

656
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,580
work is the supplier supposed to to put

657
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,820
for free in the execution of the audit

658
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:45,059
if more work is needed how is the extra

659
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,760
amount of work paid for details but a

660
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:49,559
lot of details that have to be covered

661
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,730
it's quite it's quite similar with the

662
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,889
with the pen tests where is faintest

663
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:59,309
allowed in the contract you have to say

664
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:01,919
is our pen test accepted for production

665
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:03,899
or for development are there any

666
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,120
specific systems that are maybe even

667
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,400
excluded from the pen test because for

668
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,709
one reason or another they cannot be

669
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,660
touched or maybe you have certain time

670
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,070
frames when you really don't want to

671
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,130
allow pen test if you are in the

672
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:20,549
retailing industry around Christmas time

673
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:25,140
is not a good time to pen test your your

674
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:29,940
systems who is allowed to do the dentist

675
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,710
as as the supplier of the IT service do

676
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,049
you want to allow the security team of

677
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,820
your customer to pen test you or do you

678
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:38,250
require that okay if you're going to pen

679
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:43,740
test me then you need to hire a

680
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:47,010
certified external pen test teams one

681
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,990
also specify what can you do or not do

682
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:53,790
with the reports from audits and the pen

683
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:58,220
tests can you share them with whom and

684
00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:00,800
obviously pay extra attention for those

685
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,540
for the definitions of the pen testing

686
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,879
and auditing requirements in systems

687
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,920
where you have multiple customers where

688
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,120
or which are managed by multiple parties

689
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:12,830
think about cloud systems can you pan

690
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,659
test everything no because you might be

691
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,530
pen testing the system of another

692
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:24,260
customer off of or of another supplier

693
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:26,930
and one example that that I've seen at

694
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,000
some point was that there was a contract

695
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,340
where it was mandated that the pen test

696
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,220
can be done only against non production

697
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,570
systems it was only mostly about pen

698
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,610
testing applications and they said yeah

699
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,490
you can test our applications in the non

700
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,929
production side so so you can find

701
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,870
anything that we we missed in our

702
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,610
development phase accidentally some

703
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:51,139
somebody sent to the pen testing team

704
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,780
the IP address of the production and the

705
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,640
pen tester didn't realize that and there

706
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,410
was a small problem that production

707
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,300
system they were pen testing they

708
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,770
actually found vulnerabilities they got

709
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,680
into the database they were looking at

710
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:07,010
the data and they realized they're

711
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,740
looking at actual legal cases actual

712
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:14,870
trials that were ongoing on quite

713
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:17,569
sensitive matters so that's why it's

714
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,400
important to be very clear about what is

715
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,130
allowed and not allowed and also make

716
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,480
sure that all the parties involved in

717
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,480
the delivery of those contracts

718
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:33,168
understand what are the limitations for

719
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:36,050
audits and pen tests an area where

720
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:38,540
security is very important but

721
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:44,179
ironically gets ignored quite a lot it's

722
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:47,620
all sourcing its 2018 we have been doing

723
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,840
outsourcing for what a decade or more

724
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,889
everything gets outsourced

725
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,830
infrastructure software development

726
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:57,350
security we have so many suppliers for

727
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:02,029
managed security services and yet when I

728
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:04,730
look at many security contracts I see

729
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:08,920
that security is very poorly written in

730
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:11,000
there and that is quite often because

731
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,730
when a company wants to outsource

732
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,599
something they say well this service

733
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:18,229
that I was doing

734
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,569
for its it has impeccable security this

735
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:22,729
is from from Monty Python with the with

736
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:26,329
the Black Knight he keeps chopping there

737
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:29,118
he's his hands his legs and he'll I'm

738
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:32,239
still good to find customers who

739
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,660
outsource their services and I say the

740
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,640
same

741
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,049
well I'm outsourcing the software

742
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,788
development everything that I have done

743
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:41,390
so far the application that I have been

744
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:42,890
developing is bulletproof security if

745
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,229
there is any problem it's only if

746
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:48,890
something that you as outsource or hand

747
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:50,808
has introduced so that's why it's

748
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,479
important especially if you are working

749
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:56,509
in the security team of an outsourcing

750
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:58,578
company make sure that before you accept

751
00:35:56,509 --> 00:36:01,789
that all sourcing contract you take a

752
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:04,729
baseline and you note that baseline for

753
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:07,549
security in the contract and baseline

754
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:09,489
can be can be many things you have to to

755
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:12,499
be creative on your specific case but

756
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:14,539
look at things like take take backups of

757
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:16,430
the source code so make you you are sure

758
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:19,849
that if there's a problem later you can

759
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:22,129
prove well this bug existed before I

760
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:24,140
took over the code look at all these

761
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,469
reports vulnerability scans that the

762
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,479
customer might already have and write

763
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:32,420
everything down make a note of what

764
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:34,700
security controls are in place and what

765
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,249
end especially what what kind of

766
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,578
security controls are missing so if

767
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:43,339
there is a discussion later you can you

768
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:45,109
can say to the customer I yeah you

769
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:47,479
didn't have this security control before

770
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:49,640
you cannot ask me to deliver it now if

771
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:55,549
you didn't have it what if you wanted

772
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:58,249
it's an extra service also in in the

773
00:36:55,549 --> 00:37:03,680
outsourcing contracts make sure that you

774
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:06,049
have requirements about how long the

775
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,629
supplier is allowed to take to fix

776
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:13,130
security issues and who is responsible

777
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,839
for fixing those issues and in relation

778
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,930
to these two points I remember a case

779
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,440
when again with the within our sourcing

780
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:24,769
company that took over the whole IT

781
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,520
system of of a certain company about a

782
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:30,830
year after the outsourcing they they had

783
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,230
security audit there are quite a few

784
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:37,160
findings because they didn't have that

785
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:39,290
baseline they couldn't prove that they

786
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,868
were not the ones who created the

787
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:45,040
security issues and therefore they ended

788
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:48,230
up paying for fixing security issues

789
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:53,590
that existed before before they took

790
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:53,590
over the contract quite quite expensive

791
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,520
also in our sourcing contract you have

792
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:03,260
to be very clear about how the security

793
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,940
responsibilities will be divided because

794
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,100
you have your IT systems or your

795
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,130
applications and part of the activities

796
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,900
are still going to be done by you some

797
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,530
of the some of the activities are going

798
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,140
to be done by the outsourcing parties

799
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:20,840
where is the border the separation line

800
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:27,350
between the between the security

801
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:31,369
responsibilities of the two parties now

802
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:35,299
after outsourcing and all and actually

803
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:37,490
something that I see in the India or

804
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,050
sourcing contract there's a phrase in my

805
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:43,250
favorite book and we just obviously it's

806
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:45,010
doon there's a phrase there he who

807
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:50,660
controls the spice controls the universe

808
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:54,650
sounds very catching this applies very

809
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:59,000
well also to also to access control

810
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:01,369
systems when you do outsource and in

811
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,340
general when you enter in a contract for

812
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:07,040
some IT service with with certain party

813
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,320
you need to be clear what are the rules

814
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,720
for for creating before creating

815
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,640
accounts what are the rules for

816
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,770
accessing data what kind of data can be

817
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,400
accessed so if you outsource your

818
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:21,650
software development is this is the

819
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,750
outsourcing party allowed to access the

820
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,369
day at the production data or are they

821
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,880
supposed to work only with non

822
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:30,460
production data write it down what can

823
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,680
they do what are the requirements for

824
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:36,020
your supplier to work on your system you

825
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,569
might have requirements saying well I

826
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,490
have some very critical systems I only

827
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:42,150
want people who have a security

828
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,859
background check or even a search

829
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,380
security certification to work on those

830
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:48,390
particular systems might not be

831
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,089
applicable to everything but in some

832
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,740
situations I've been working with with

833
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:54,509
air airports where they said yeah

834
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,939
everything that we do

835
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,309
if somebody's touching it that person

836
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:05,549
must have a government security

837
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:07,319
clearance and specify how are you going

838
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:10,349
to check those things how are you going

839
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:14,750
to check if the access control rules are

840
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:17,069
actually in are actually enforced and

841
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,190
because we've been talking about things

842
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:22,349
that things that might create issues

843
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,740
when you think about issues we have to

844
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:28,829
think about liability it's a term that

845
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,808
is if you do a search for movies in IMDB

846
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:34,470
you find quite a few movies and TV

847
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:36,480
series with liability in the title we

848
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:40,169
should use that word even more in

849
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,529
security contracts because liability is

850
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,559
about who pays for when things go wrong

851
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:49,049
who takes the responsibility for things

852
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,049
going wrong and things do go wrong

853
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:53,549
quite often you've seen the alien

854
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,220
earlier and you've seen pretty much

855
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:58,020
every sci-fi movie where things go wrong

856
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,180
constantly security is pretty much like

857
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:04,079
a sci-fi movies everything goes wrong at

858
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,390
some point and especially in security

859
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,329
context think about what could go wrong

860
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:13,049
from a security perspective or by a

861
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:16,260
security person I remember a case of a

862
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:19,859
security pentester accidentally dropping

863
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:23,520
the production database who is liable

864
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:26,308
who pays for all that downtime is the

865
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,349
pentester liable or do they have a

866
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:29,910
liability waiver that was written in the

867
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:31,650
contract which says no we take

868
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,348
absolutely no responsibilities for what

869
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:38,190
we break make sure that your contract is

870
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:40,829
clear about those liabilities and of

871
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,950
course on the vendor side all the

872
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:46,410
vendors try to shield themselves from

873
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:48,240
the liabilities starting with the if you

874
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,700
read the end-user agreements for every

875
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,069
software no software vendor takes any

876
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,069
liability for anything same security

877
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:59,550
you can transfer some of those

878
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,900
liabilities but not everything is

879
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,460
possible there there are some

880
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,950
regulations that might say you know this

881
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,610
liability you cannot transfer it in no

882
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:11,129
form whatsoever

883
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:14,550
and it remember that it can go both ways

884
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:17,340
so regardless if you are working for a

885
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,840
supplier or for a customer as a security

886
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,060
professional you have to think about

887
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,900
liability because there can be issues

888
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:28,290
caused by each party to the other the

889
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,540
supplier can can cause issues for for

890
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:32,850
the customer or the customer can trigger

891
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,779
issues for a supplier you have to cover

892
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:40,080
all those situations and the last lesson

893
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:43,740
that I'm going to put to the screen

894
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:46,319
today is not to make assumptions because

895
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,720
assumptions make life interesting but

896
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,610
not necessarily in an interesting and

897
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,100
pleasant way it's like a Doctor Who

898
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:56,600
episode when you make assumptions things

899
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:59,970
will deviate in all kind of strange ways

900
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:03,270
do not make assumptions when it comes to

901
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:06,299
security in the contract make sure that

902
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:08,130
if you want something if you want

903
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,080
something to happen in the security

904
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:16,620
context don't pray for it write it down

905
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:20,360
and I will give an example here with a

906
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:22,940
company also in an outsourcing context

907
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:26,040
the customer had a very good very strong

908
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,080
security team the outsourcing party

909
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,300
assume that that security team will

910
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,420
remain in place after outsourcing yes

911
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,900
what about three months after the

912
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,150
outsourcing contract was signed the

913
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,900
security team of the customer hell has

914
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:46,380
been seriously downside downsized and

915
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,450
the supplier had to do a lot of security

916
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,190
work and they had to bring security

917
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,399
consultants to do a lot of security work

918
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:58,670
that they assumed that the security team

919
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,670
of the customer will do it was not cheap

920
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:07,260
and don't forget to apply to everything

921
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,480
the trust and verify

922
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,340
if you write it down don't assume that

923
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,110
just by writing it down in the contract

924
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:17,060
is going to get to get done

925
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:23,250
check it verified audited been tested

926
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:26,060
always so this is basically the

927
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,560
Decalogue and I will I will summarize

928
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,450
the points that that I've gone through

929
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,240
today by the way it's called the

930
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,189
Decalogue ish because initially I I

931
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,740
thought that it's going to be ten I

932
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:40,650
found that actually quite a few more

933
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:43,080
issues I limit it to 12 today but trust

934
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:46,320
me you can you can find quite a few more

935
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:49,650
but if you do at least these twelve

936
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,660
things you are going to be in a much

937
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:55,530
better shape than most companies are

938
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:58,799
today so here is very briefly the

939
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:02,360
Decalogue again when you make an IIT

940
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,950
contract put security requirements in it

941
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,990
make sure you are clear about what are

942
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:10,859
the security policies which apply to

943
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:12,919
that contract make sure that you are

944
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:15,000
prepared for changes in those policies

945
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,070
make sure that you actually read the

946
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,370
security policies and requirements that

947
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:24,060
you refer into the into the contract do

948
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:27,180
not use the term based practice make

949
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,970
sure you understand any any framework

950
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:33,120
any set of regulations that is mentioned

951
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:35,520
in the contract make sure that you

952
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,350
actually measure the quality of the

953
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,310
security services make sure that you

954
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:43,290
have security metrics and make sure that

955
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:45,630
you put clear boundaries and definitions

956
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:49,860
about how ten tests and audits are being

957
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:51,780
performed if you do outsourcing make

958
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,310
sure you take how you take a good

959
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,680
baseline of the security level before

960
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,110
our sourcing make sure you take care of

961
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,970
the access rights make sure that you

962
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:06,450
talk about liabilities and do not make

963
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:08,520
assumptions well just in a very few

964
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,109
minutes next to this Decalogue I will

965
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,030
share a few more lessons that I learned

966
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:16,080
about contracts and how to deal with

967
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:18,030
security and contracts first of all the

968
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,470
biggest lesson I learned Murphy was an

969
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,790
optimist things go wrong

970
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:24,368
that's why we need to have clear

971
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:26,319
contracts because things will go wrong

972
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:27,760
it's not something that can go wrong

973
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,410
will grow everything will go wrong

974
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,240
period but maybe even more important

975
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:37,089
security is not about security

976
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,220
we don't do security just for the sake

977
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:41,710
of playing with technical things in most

978
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,410
organizations especially in the

979
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,869
commercial world we do security to help

980
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:51,960
the business to protect the business and

981
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:55,660
to enable the business to work and

982
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:59,589
remember that you can either be a driver

983
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:01,509
of of culture you can change the culture

984
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:03,970
and instill security in the culture of

985
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,010
the organization or you can let the

986
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,290
organization impose the culture on you

987
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:10,390
it's a choice but I prefer the position

988
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:13,810
where we as security professionals take

989
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:16,060
the initiative and we help the culture

990
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,569
of our organizations to be more security

991
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,569
focused

992
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,049
the other lesson that I've seen over and

993
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:28,270
over again if as a security team you are

994
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:30,790
not involved from the beginning in in

995
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:34,420
the contract you will be involved much

996
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:36,369
more in escalations so take it as a time

997
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,050
investment if you will spend some time

998
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:40,780
working with the contract team it will

999
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:42,790
save you a lot of time later and work

1000
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,010
with those commercial teams in advance

1001
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,670
don't come to them with security

1002
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,640
requirements

1003
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:50,650
three days before signing the contract

1004
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,270
work with them in advance explain what

1005
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,579
security is about explain your security

1006
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:57,040
policies explain what are the principle

1007
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:59,560
help them to actually write standard

1008
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,230
templates for for their contracts and

1009
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,849
they will support you they will find in

1010
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,859
the contracts for your security and

1011
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:07,900
requirements but if you don't if you

1012
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:11,440
leave it until the last minute they will

1013
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:14,950
find against you because very simple

1014
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,109
their bonus is based not on what happens

1015
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:19,240
after the contract signing their bonus

1016
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:21,490
is based if the contracts get signed and

1017
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:26,410
they want to get it signed as quickly as

1018
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:28,270
possible and some of the best contracts

1019
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,970
that I've seen are the contracts where

1020
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,710
the people who are actually involved in

1021
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,149
consuming and delivering those services

1022
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,829
or

1023
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:39,069
actually involve in writing those

1024
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,750
contracts on the same principle of its

1025
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:42,579
if it's done right from the beginning in

1026
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:46,900
the contract it creates much less

1027
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:49,150
headaches in in the end so as a security

1028
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,490
professional involved with the with a

1029
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,990
contractual team make sure that any

1030
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,569
other stakeholders that you might be

1031
00:48:52,990 --> 00:49:01,629
dependent on also has a voice in the

1032
00:48:55,569 --> 00:49:03,460
contract negotiation and I know that for

1033
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,319
some security people dealing with

1034
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,089
contracts with legal things like wrong

1035
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:09,940
this is not something that I do this is

1036
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:14,500
something outside of my my scope of

1037
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:17,140
interest not true it's like threat

1038
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,329
modeling it's very simple threat

1039
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,839
modeling you think about what could go

1040
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:24,369
wrong and you put that in a contract and

1041
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:27,308
you put a mitigation for it in the

1042
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:30,549
contract that's always that's what our

1043
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:33,690
work supporting the writing of IT

1044
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:36,910
contracts is about just threat modeling

1045
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:40,049
so this is what I had for today thank

1046
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,049
you very much for listening
