1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,980
thank you it's always an honor to come

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,158
to Tokyo to come to Japan thank you to

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,890
kana and to code blue for such a

4
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:20,040
professional and amazing event so

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,490
because our task is so difficult as

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,880
cyber defenders I am trying to draw on

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,820
some inspiration from from my and

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:35,340
perhaps your favorite movie spirited

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:38,040
away so Who am I I did 20 years in the

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,350
US government I worked for a fire I and

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,390
now for Komodo but I look at the

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,930
intelligence picture so the higher

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,200
higher level of who and why of hacking

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,239
so I'm primarily looking at the the

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,190
impact and specifically the the

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,899
geopolitics and and what I'm going to

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,920
show you in this presentation is

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,050
actually that I think a lot more of what

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,140
you're seeing when you look at your log

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,560
files is in fact nation state hacking

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,780
right and I think I've got the data to

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,909
prove it so the power side of the

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,810
equation I think there's maybe three

24
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,860
kinds of cyberattack there's data theft

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,990
data denial and data manipulation but I

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,950
think they come in that order in terms

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,048
of frequency and sophistication I think

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,799
a lot of what I'm going to show you is

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:39,860
cyber espionage but therein lies a lot

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:45,150
of power power for decision makers so

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:48,869
just one analyst one company one day

32
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:53,240
this is what I see right in terms of

33
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:56,220
malware detection every country 27

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,860
malware types thousands of malware

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,100
families and it's very international

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,939
space so there is only one internet

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:10,769
there's only one cyber space but hackers

38
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:14,459
are constantly occupying terrain in

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:17,580
other countries giving them potentially

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,460
dozens of opportunities to collect

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,860
information that their national security

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,460
establishment would want to to have

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,190
right but from a cyber defense

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,350
perspective this is a challenge I sat at

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,470
the Pentagon for years trying to figure

46
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,390
out this attribution question much

47
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,450
closer to the year 2000

48
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,019
who is hacking us right and long lists

49
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,700
of IP addresses where to start in terms

50
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,910
of law enforcement and

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,459
counterintelligence well there's an

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,670
analyst one of the ways I do it is try

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,330
to look at data from interesting

54
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:00,600
perspectives that give insight into how

55
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,370
to understand the data and you can see

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,239
here very quickly

57
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,840
you can have a picture of vulnerability

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,140
across the planet right Africa because

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,690
it's poorer and there's a lot of

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,230
conflict zones they probably don't have

61
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,660
a professional cyber defence staff so

62
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,950
they're very vulnerable to worms and

63
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:29,760
viruses for example but this gives

64
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,589
attackers nice space to operate in right

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,649
if I'm an American hacker that wants to

66
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,170
target Japan or vice versa there's a

67
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,140
chance I might bounce through Africa

68
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:43,829
right and give give me some plausible

69
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,220
deniability some anonymity because the

70
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:51,540
chances you chase me back are relatively

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:55,290
low right but so when you look at the

72
00:03:51,540 --> 00:04:00,799
planet each nation is uniquely

73
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:06,299
vulnerable to to cyber security issues

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:08,430
so here is a scale of just four nations

75
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,530
but it's showing you the ratio of

76
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:17,400
malware types within them and it's it's

77
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,470
interesting to see that if you compare

78
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,580
Switzerland to Somalia for example

79
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:26,610
vastly different malware types and

80
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,900
families inhabit them in Switzerland

81
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,100
you'll find very

82
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:36,150
hi highly engineered high return on

83
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,479
investment malware right and South

84
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,380
Africa you can see here very vulnerable

85
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,150
to worms and viruses right so

86
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,219
Switzerland's very tight right they have

87
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,429
a lot of money they have a lot of

88
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,880
experience with security and so this is

89
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,699
the kind of analysis that I'm doing to

90
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,419
understand the space but the cyber

91
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,199
defense advice that you would give to

92
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:07,440
different countries really is unique

93
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,470
here are some Asian countries on the

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,979
same type of scale and I'll just point

95
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:18,240
out two things viruses in the

96
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:19,710
Philippines Russia Vietnam you can see

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,169
that these countries are more vulnerable

98
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:28,430
to older code right older malware that

99
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:32,729
take advantage of either unlicensed

100
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:36,360
unpatched pirated software right this is

101
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:38,280
not good for them or for the world but

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,060
you can see the state of cybersecurity

103
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,090
within them in Japan and South Korea you

104
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,570
can see some similarity in terms of

105
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,840
ratios but also the the backdoors that I

106
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,539
was talking about and this is indicative

107
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,929
of more wealth in these countries and

108
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:02,699
more targeted operations to go after

109
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:06,330
that wealth in this presentation I will

110
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:09,120
show you a number of timelines because I

111
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:13,889
find this is one of the most helpful

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,090
ways to view your data so if one of your

113
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:21,020
computers is pinging or sending a

114
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,929
communication at 2:00 in the morning

115
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,760
that's a sign of trouble right on your

116
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,060
network because nobody should be sitting

117
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,169
there so in the same way time lines show

118
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,909
you when things happen and it's very

119
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:40,740
important especially in national

120
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:41,190
security to see the spikes in malware in

121
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,480
the

122
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:48,180
potential causes so Trojans I'll just

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,860
show you for malware types these are our

124
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:57,150
most stable set of malware but you can

125
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,720
see with Ukraine in Egypt someone on on

126
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,750
July 29th and August 2nd was very

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,400
determined to get information out of one

128
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:10,410
of those countries but Trojans we have

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,190
thousands they're our most complicated

130
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,800
data set but our biggest as well right

131
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,680
maybe 80% of our detection Zoar

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,350
something non-application are our

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,900
Trojans the trouble with a Trojan is

134
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:28,880
it's a Swiss Army knife right you can do

135
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:33,390
anything with the Trojan from it's just

136
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:37,260
read email to encrypt the hard drive for

137
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:40,289
ransomware look at how volatile worms

138
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:44,969
are right and in general you'll see a

139
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:47,880
poorer socio-economic profile of these

140
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,310
countries but worms

141
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,790
Stuxnet for example is often referred to

142
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,790
as a worm because it's it's one of its

143
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:00,720
most powerful characteristics that worms

144
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,900
are autonomous right they can travel the

145
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,830
internet on their own and take advantage

146
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,539
of vulnerabilities at scale right so if

147
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,349
you want to take if you're gonna target

148
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:17,150
Texas or France you might need a

149
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:20,970
powerful worm right to go after a large

150
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:25,190
potentially a large target you can see

151
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:29,250
here at Turkey India Brazil Indonesia

152
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:32,370
these are places that are poor and also

153
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,630
you can see in the case of Russia Turkey

154
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,440
in Indonesia these were associated with

155
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:43,469
elections which I'll show you soon

156
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,870
Ukraine has a real problem with viruses

157
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:49,080
you can see these are our largest spikes

158
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,570
over the course of a year and these are

159
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,100
going to be associated probably with the

160
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:58,540
ongoing conflict with Russia

161
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:03,449
but it's not only a somewhat poorer

162
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:07,779
country Ukraine but is at war right

163
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:10,839
viruses are indicative of a poor state

164
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:13,360
of health on the network but you can see

165
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:18,480
here that hackers are really taking

166
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:21,940
advantage of Ukraine through that vector

167
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,579
backdoors as I've said I believe are a

168
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,660
sign of a more targeted operation a

169
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:31,949
higher return on investment higher

170
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,740
engineering but you can see here so this

171
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:41,050
unsurprisingly we see United Kingdom and

172
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:43,180
Italy here but also Russia in so we'll

173
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,089
get into this in a second but I think a

174
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,029
lot of what we see on the networks is in

175
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,899
fact geopolitically driven now these

176
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,130
detection x'

177
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:56,860
in the UK are they match up fairly

178
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:01,569
nicely with the alleged assassination of

179
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,490
a Russian spy in the UK you can see here

180
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:08,160
if you look at the spike here where

181
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:13,839
where Russia is noted I saw the same

182
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:18,519
backdoor hash not only in the UK but

183
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:23,500
also in Russia at the same day and same

184
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:28,829
time also suggesting a relationship with

185
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:33,160
with this malware so now for some

186
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:36,519
timelines in geopolitics so this slide

187
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,149
shows that in the United States over a

188
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:44,319
six-month period for three malware types

189
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:48,009
worms Trojans and viruses we had the

190
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:52,269
highest single day of detection on march

191
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:54,519
13th so sometimes for a spike I say well

192
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,730
what was the cause of this spike or in

193
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,220
other cases if there's a big event I'll

194
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,579
look for the malware from the other

195
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,209
direction but here I didn't know what

196
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,930
happened on March 13th so I type into

197
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,479
Google

198
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,029
you know the United States March 13th

199
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,260
and it was the day that Donald Trump

200
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:19,149
announced the new Secretary of State and

201
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,220
the name of the new CIA director and

202
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:28,750
what this does is it gives fresh meat to

203
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:31,000
hackers around the world and it's not

204
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,060
that I'm saying this is the Russians or

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,839
this is the Chinese what I'm saying is

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,630
that a lot of nation-states and their

207
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:45,310
state hackers or their contractors

208
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:48,100
subcontractors lone Wolf's you name it

209
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,790
it's the whole collection of them that

210
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:55,770
all of a sudden have new intelligence

211
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,480
requirements right and this is not one

212
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:01,360
computer or even a thousand but these

213
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,850
are millions of data points collated and

214
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,570
if you're skeptical on this slide that's

215
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,620
great here is a case in which you can

216
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,720
see very clearly the relationship right

217
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,180
between network security and national

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,610
security so these are the annual

219
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,120
military exercises between the United

220
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:26,620
States and South Korea and on those very

221
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,930
days you see the Trojan detection zin

222
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,860
South Korea they are through the roof

223
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,170
why because not only or the United

224
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,050
States and South Korea and North Korea

225
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:42,490
probably interested in what's happening

226
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:47,709
there but also Japan also China also

227
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:51,400
Russia and some other nations to June

228
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:54,250
4th in China our largest single day of

229
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,920
detection this year by far and this

230
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,980
speaks to the power again of computer

231
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,719
network operations in this case it may

232
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,270
be some law-enforcement some

233
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,220
counterintelligence but you can be sure

234
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,829
that three-letter agencies in other

235
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,649
countries will also be very interested

236
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:15,870
in what's happening in China on the

237
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,870
anniversary of Tiananmen Square

238
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,680
revolution in Armenia also brings

239
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,170
interest from

240
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,459
hackers right probably domestic and

241
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:31,459
abroad and what does this mean for you

242
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:35,680
if you're in a healthcare right industry

243
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:42,430
well whenever there's a new CEO

244
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:44,930
acquisitions stock price mergers

245
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,449
anything that relates to healthcare on a

246
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,229
strategic scale the same thing is going

247
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:54,490
to happen to you right in your industry

248
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:58,640
in Belarus they tried to pass

249
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:02,000
legislation against fake news so we see

250
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,029
a spike on that day no it's probably

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,709
some government action and maybe some

252
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,720
foreign governments trying to figure out

253
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,989
what's happening maybe some students

254
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,029
right maybe some potential

255
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,589
revolutionaries but another thing I'm

256
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:19,430
gonna show you as we move into the

257
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,560
slides is the order of operations for

258
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,439
hacking right you've probably heard of

259
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,469
the cyber kill chain right if I'm

260
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,890
targeting a person in this audience you

261
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,890
know I need to know their their email

262
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:37,100
address their IP address etc it's the

263
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,830
same on a national scale right and so

264
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,200
what I'm gonna show you is that if

265
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,360
there's an election coming they'll be ad

266
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,959
where there will be suspicious

267
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:52,490
applications followed by viruses or

268
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:54,410
worms followed by trojans backdoors this

269
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,459
is the order of operations for hacking

270
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:03,740
whether it's one person an enterprise or

271
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:07,130
a nation now sometimes smaller countries

272
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:11,360
as well it's even easier to see but this

273
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:14,420
spike in Nigeria was easy I typed in

274
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,800
Nigeria May 24th and they were on the

275
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:23,149
cover of CNN with a Amnesty

276
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:30,529
International article decrying the human

277
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:34,070
rights situation in Nigeria in Nepal May

278
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,480
28th the day that Nepal decided not to

279
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,680
cooperate with

280
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:44,149
China on developing a international

281
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:47,000
project Dam in the country here's a

282
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:51,380
financially motivated attack right in

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,750
the little island of st. Kitts Nevis my

284
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,839
daughter actually found this spike and

285
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,660
so then I then I say well what happened

286
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:03,320
there and it was pretty easy to see on

287
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:06,709
the same day on march 13th the the

288
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,019
island was placed on a an international

289
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:12,589
financial blacklist

290
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:15,860
right so that was on the 13th but on the

291
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,620
12th already we can see hackers busy

292
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,560
trying to take advantage of the

293
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:24,620
situation as in insider trading right

294
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,609
somebody knew about this and beforehand

295
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:34,100
and was hacking the country something

296
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:36,110
related to finances so that was

297
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,540
sometimes looking at spikes and then

298
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:43,250
trying to explain them but in the next

299
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:46,910
two cases I so the summit's in Singapore

300
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,490
between Trump and Kim so that's the only

301
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,010
thing in the news for the day so I pull

302
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,529
up Singapore detection and you can see

303
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,019
the interest on the part of hackers

304
00:16:54,529 --> 00:17:00,110
right again most of this will be

305
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:03,740
espionage but some of it might be more

306
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,380
targeted and manipulative operations you

307
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,260
know it's hard to know but you can see

308
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,860
not only the proximity physically but in

309
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,579
terms of time so same thing in Finland

310
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:19,879
with the Trump Putin summit and the day

311
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:23,209
it was announced I saw a nice virus

312
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,880
spike in Finland and in order to further

313
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,610
confirm the relationship I said where

314
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,720
did the spike take place and it was in

315
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,790
the neighborhood of Helsinki where the

316
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,010
summit would take place right because

317
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,370
sometimes you want to be close to your

318
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:44,480
target right for not only for logical

319
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:46,879
but physical connectivity I have one

320
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,860
slide it's not in this presentation but

321
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,950
a blow-up of four

322
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,189
Maryland in Washington DC and you see a

323
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,830
nice red ring around the White House in

324
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,620
terms of malware detection right so the

325
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,809
hackers are not behaving randomly but

326
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,870
they have a target that they're trying

327
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:09,590
to get close to

328
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:12,340
so the Saudi journalist Khashoggi right

329
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,899
they disappeared on October 2nd

330
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,760
obviously this is a major news story

331
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:21,799
with international implications

332
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:26,960
ultimately that could could be regime

333
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:30,080
changing right on October 2nd already I

334
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,780
see suspicious malware detection in

335
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,139
Turkey which tells me that intelligence

336
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,110
agencies informed ones are seeking

337
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:42,830
information very quickly about what's

338
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:46,219
going on right so on October 2nd and

339
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,559
October 4th in Turkey it comes a bit

340
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,250
later in Saudi Arabia but you can see

341
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:56,870
Saudi Arabia because of its wealth

342
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,880
should be a fairly stable malware

343
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,418
environment but you can see here on

344
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,870
October 14th and October 19th in roughly

345
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:07,970
two weeks after the disappearance

346
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:12,709
somebody is very interested in pulling

347
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:15,290
information out of Saudi Arabia so let's

348
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,650
look at a couple of timelines on Japan

349
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:22,450
and you can't make this stuff up right

350
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:26,240
so this is a year and a half worth of

351
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:29,270
malware detection in Japan just from my

352
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,970
company but I drop it on a slide and

353
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,540
this is what it looks like right one

354
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,720
massive worm spike as I said then

355
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,549
followed by Trojan right you have to

356
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,340
disseminate malware propagate malware

357
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,010
before you can exploit it so in this

358
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:50,899
case July 15th there is a propagation

359
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:54,260
and a crescendo of exploitation up to

360
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:58,160
August 30th well on August 29th

361
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:01,879
there was a launch of a missile from

362
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,720
North Korea over Japan and

363
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,510
I cannot prove that the two things are

364
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,660
related but they definitely appear

365
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:15,680
suspiciously correlated on a timeline

366
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,110
here I don't know I tried to find a

367
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,660
relationship but I'm not sure but

368
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,790
perhaps you with expert knowledge on

369
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:26,090
your own country could figure it out

370
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:30,500
these are applications and what I want

371
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,300
to say here is our malware analysts at

372
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,800
my previous company and now at my

373
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,860
current company they say why are you

374
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,040
looking at applications and I said well

375
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,320
are they behaving suspiciously yes they

376
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,409
try to change your browser settings or

377
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,490
they try to install functionality in

378
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:52,880
your startup processes etc well to me

379
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:56,630
that looks suspicious and it may not be

380
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:00,260
a backdoor it may not be a trojan but I

381
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:04,100
see suspicious applications clustering

382
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:06,850
around geopolitical events so on July

383
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,889
18th or September 11th of this year

384
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:13,550
maybe something interesting happened in

385
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:17,780
Japan for which someone needed

386
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:21,740
information about what was happening so

387
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:24,230
that's a lot about the power of computer

388
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:31,550
network operations especially to collect

389
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:33,320
information quickly I also think that we

390
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:38,030
have to be realistic about what's

391
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:43,580
possible when we talk cyber war cyber

392
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:47,450
attack for example in Estonia 2007 or

393
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:52,000
Ukraine 2014 we see so many cyber

394
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:55,250
attacks but are they strategic victories

395
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,360
we don't know right there's a famous

396
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,540
story about a reporter asked the Chinese

397
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,959
Foreign Minister Joe and ly what do you

398
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:10,310
think about the French Revolution was it

399
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,840
a good idea or a bad idea so Joe and

400
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,629
live responds it's too soon to tell

401
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,949
right

402
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:24,570
200 years later but we need patience and

403
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:28,920
a lot of times politics their short term

404
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:31,889
right in so that's one reason I and we

405
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:36,240
can see this close relationship between

406
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:39,360
malware and politics is because we need

407
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,340
information today so in this case March

408
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:47,189
28th this massive spike in Croatia

409
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:50,699
occurred the same day that Russia was

410
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:54,990
very angry with Croatia over expelling

411
00:22:50,700 --> 00:23:01,280
a Russian spy right was this espionage

412
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:01,280
or was it punishment we're not sure but

413
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,300
is it effective is a whole other

414
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:14,570
question right but we can see the data

415
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:17,760
here is Ukraine and for example May 24th

416
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:23,189
corresponding to heavy fighting in the

417
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:27,450
east of Ukraine does it aid the war

418
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:31,920
victory sure cyberattacks are very

419
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:35,190
capable of gathering information in the

420
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,450
same way that the 13th chapter of the

421
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,740
art of war says that generals and

422
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,290
leaders must collect as much information

423
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,410
as possible right about their

424
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:52,980
adversaries will they be decisive in

425
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:54,450
warfare is highly unlikely here's some

426
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,100
cases from the Middle East

427
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:02,550
and what I can show you is that

428
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:05,070
especially when international when

429
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:08,850
nations or international organizations

430
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:12,389
are active in Syria for example on the

431
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:15,149
issue of chemical weapons big malware

432
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:20,730
spikes right so here we see US air

433
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:23,550
strikes us seeks inquiry chemical

434
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,190
weapons thought to be used these are

435
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:29,100
instances in which computer network

436
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:33,150
operations are leveraged he

437
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:36,959
in Yemen Saudi bombing missile hits

438
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:40,500
Saudi industrial target missile fired at

439
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,559
Saudi capital right when a missile is

440
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,530
fired from Yemen into Saudi Arabia you

441
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,460
will see a bump so I'm one of the papers

442
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:54,809
I'm currently working on is showing that

443
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:57,169
in 2017 there were nine ballistic

444
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:00,600
missile launches from North Korea and

445
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:04,860
what we're trying to prove is that each

446
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:08,370
one of them yielded a bump or a spike in

447
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:11,939
malware detection in South Korea right

448
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:14,399
so an event that important the hackers

449
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:19,610
need to get in quickly to understand

450
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:24,450
what's happening Palestine the same UN

451
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:28,740
International Criminal Court us these

452
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:31,830
are international events for which major

453
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,730
powers and intelligence agencies are

454
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:39,270
going to need information quickly so

455
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:43,710
here's one from Iran right and again

456
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:49,010
Pompeyo Pompeo but the big one on mate

457
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:54,750
sorry July 24th right coincides with

458
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:58,440
July 23rd tweet from Donald Trump you

459
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:01,530
know unless Iran behaves it will suffer

460
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,669
you know consequences the likes of which

461
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:08,700
no other country has suffered before so

462
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:11,520
I think these two things are absolutely

463
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,610
related right not saying these are

464
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,908
necessarily American hackers but I can

465
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:21,959
say that hackers are very interested in

466
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:25,200
this tense political situation here's

467
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,710
some North Korea data because my company

468
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,080
comodo is 20 years old and it's a

469
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:34,110
Turkish company so we actually have

470
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,539
beautiful coverage over parts of the

471
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:40,229
world that some other cyber security

472
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,560
companies know very little about because

473
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,030
of our history

474
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:51,429
so we have we have installations in

475
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:55,720
North Korean IP space so I drop it at a

476
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:57,550
very low level of focus our detection is

477
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,740
in South Korea on a time line sorry

478
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,740
North Korea and you see this massive

479
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,460
spike it looks like a shark fin yeah

480
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,530
and that was the very day that Donald

481
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,580
Trump was at the United Nations and

482
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:17,230
threatened to destroy North Korea right

483
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,960
so again hackers very interested at that

484
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:24,760
point in time about what is happening in

485
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:27,160
North Korea and the more I dig into the

486
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:31,360
data the more you can see the reasons

487
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:34,570
for the spikes and this is why I really

488
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,669
do want to suggest that more of what

489
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:40,179
you're seeing in your log files is

490
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:44,290
nation state activity than you think

491
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,830
right and less of it is random than you

492
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,710
think

493
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,439
so just the tallest spike here you

494
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:54,250
probably be interested Trump in Japan

495
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,410
Trump in South Korea Trump in Beijing so

496
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,180
I could do a whole presentation I've

497
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:02,860
been looking at this data for two or

498
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:06,580
three years Trump Tillerson Netanyahu

499
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:10,000
when they travel a cloud of malware

500
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,129
follows them right and this is only

501
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,910
logical right these are major

502
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:20,380
geopolitical events for which a dozen

503
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:24,160
two dozen maybe more intelligence

504
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:26,260
agencies maybe even individual

505
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,500
researchers but certainly contractors

506
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:33,660
are also interested again North Korea

507
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:37,870
this big spike was anti-censorship

508
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:40,600
programs as well as Windows activation

509
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:44,199
software that we detected and it

510
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,419
coincided when the South Korean and the

511
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,050
North Korean leaders were holding hands

512
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:54,460
on the border it's totally logical right

513
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:54,970
it's not random here's one last one a

514
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,940
nice

515
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:02,309
spike on July 12 in North Korean IP

516
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:05,440
space when things got really bad between

517
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:10,658
the u.s. and North Korea we were very

518
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:13,840
frustrated with North Korea okay so the

519
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:16,980
final element persistence now if you

520
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,770
haven't seen spirited away the film

521
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,960
please do yourself a favor and watch it

522
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:27,370
or if you haven't seen it for a long

523
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:31,210
time because as a cyber defense team and

524
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:33,129
all of us are family to some degree we

525
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,320
see each other at conferences around the

526
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,950
world and we're trying to protect

527
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:43,299
computers and as miko put it yesterday

528
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:45,520
we're trying to protect civilization you

529
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:48,460
know it's there there is a lot of

530
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,210
malware out there and it is going to

531
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:58,630
require persistence on our part because

532
00:29:52,210 --> 00:30:00,340
the hackers are all day every day so I

533
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,260
want to show you here the current

534
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,480
research that I'm looking at for

535
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:09,070
elections because this is a hot topic

536
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:12,700
and again I find correlations all over

537
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:17,200
the place right so when Donald Trump was

538
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:21,580
inaugurated on January 20th 2017 this

539
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,360
all this date all this slide is is all

540
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:30,220
of my company's malware detection z'

541
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,760
summed by day for six months or

542
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,150
something

543
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,610
not sure three months here point is is

544
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:40,809
the highest cluster it's easy to see

545
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:43,570
right but on such an important day

546
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:46,780
transfer of power I know that your

547
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,990
Emperor for example for example next

548
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:54,360
year there'll be a change right then

549
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:58,080
there'll be the Olympics in in Japan so

550
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:02,049
beware that all of these major events

551
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,470
there are going to be hackers in malware

552
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:08,950
clustering around them why because it's

553
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:11,800
going to fall under other nations

554
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:16,630
and their contractors collection

555
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:21,100
requirements so even in peaceful

556
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:25,000
countries like Norway which Norway is

557
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:28,000
actually a very strategic player in NATO

558
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,580
right there's a lot of games taking

559
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,400
place currently between Russia and

560
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:37,560
Norway right if you think about it

561
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,790
between global warming submarines

562
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,450
Norway is where a lot of the equipment

563
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:46,210
for NATO is stored for the event of war

564
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,770
you can see that somebody was very

565
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:54,370
interested in their election in Norway

566
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:59,170
in Iraq as well not only for the vote

567
00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:01,090
but for the recount right intelligence

568
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:04,840
agencies very interested now are they

569
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:09,639
trying to manipulate the vote it's hard

570
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:11,550
to say but with with a Trojan you can do

571
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,220
anything right you can steal information

572
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:17,950
you can block information or you can

573
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,290
manipulate data right you can change

574
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:25,380
numbers right there might be paper

575
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:28,510
ballots that could correct the record

576
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:32,730
but after the election is over there

577
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,730
might be no chance for a do-over

578
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:40,450
referendum in Burundi a gubernatorial

579
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,200
election that means governor right the

580
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:48,070
leader of Virginia this was a big race

581
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,530
in America Trump campaigned for his

582
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:54,250
candidate you can see this is the week

583
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,830
before the election the number of Trojan

584
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:01,060
detection zhh in this mice state

585
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:05,220
currently in Ohio we just had a special

586
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:09,070
election and the various colors here are

587
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,640
Trojan detection 'z by state just

588
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:15,280
dropped on a time line you can see

589
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,160
trojans the week prior to the election

590
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,480
someone very interested in what's taking

591
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,480
place this is incredible

592
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,360
then I said well let me look across the

593
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,280
planet and see if I can do something

594
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,520
systematic and so I looked at 45

595
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,940
elections over six months at the

596
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:39,629
national level and about a third of them

597
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:42,810
had a very tight correlation with the

598
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:45,300
highest malware spikes so everything

599
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:49,200
that's left on the chart here is about

600
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,990
30% of the 45 but all of these countries

601
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,900
had their highest malware spike within a

602
00:33:51,990 --> 00:34:00,240
couple of days of the election or

603
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:03,210
referendum so now I'm digging in to try

604
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,980
and understand this better and what I'm

605
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:12,120
finding is is somewhat alarming but here

606
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:15,899
Mali Russia Turkey as there by John

607
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:19,560
Columbia you can see this same hacker

608
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:22,350
kill chain write applications they would

609
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,690
be used to gather information right and

610
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:28,710
I can't think of another way to do it

611
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:31,590
because the cyber kill chain for an

612
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:34,620
individual is I have to know your your

613
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,710
email address your IP address your

614
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:42,270
social media account well if I want to

615
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:46,199
target Texas or Moscow you know I've got

616
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:49,800
to be able to do that at scale and so

617
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,469
one way to do that would be adware right

618
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,230
or some suspicious application that I

619
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:59,520
get you know not all of you to install

620
00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:01,980
but maybe half of you maybe even 10% of

621
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,110
you but then I can extrapolate right

622
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:09,930
from that to as a sample of the data set

623
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:12,470
to the larger group but applications

624
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,390
then followed I mean look at Russia

625
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:18,359
applications right before the election

626
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:22,859
right so that dotted red line is the

627
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:26,670
election the blue line is the number of

628
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:29,910
suspicious applications that we detected

629
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:34,980
right before the election followed by

630
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:39,390
worms and Trojans right so Turkey

631
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,579
well the applications came right before

632
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,940
the announcement of the election been

633
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:47,640
followed by worms and finally Trojans

634
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,339
the day before day or two before the

635
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,150
election so you see the pattern right

636
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:56,040
and so in the United States currently we

637
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:00,030
have an important election you may be

638
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:04,170
aware and Trump is very nervous and the

639
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:08,430
the country is on edge but you can see

640
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,339
here we have 50 states and these are 13

641
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:15,210
what we call swing states they could go

642
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:18,450
Democrat or Republican the other states

643
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:21,390
don't really matter right every election

644
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:27,210
is essentially decided by Ohio

645
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:31,500
Pennsylvania Florida etc so I took the

646
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,859
13 swing states and the 37 non swing

647
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:40,140
states and you can see six months ago

648
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:45,000
the math was normal right the 37 had you

649
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:48,839
know roughly 2/3 times the 13 but as we

650
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,050
move closer to the election now the non

651
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:55,950
or the swing states are higher than the

652
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:59,760
than the non swing states so 37 is

653
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:02,730
higher than 13 right because the

654
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,579
election is just around the corner and

655
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:08,940
look at this just as we saw in other

656
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:12,390
countries here comes the adware here

657
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,700
comes the reconnaissance you need

658
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:17,540
information quickly right so you're

659
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:21,060
sending out the suspicious applications

660
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,670
and the adware right so one two three

661
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,549
four these are all swing states these

662
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:30,329
are states that the election will turn

663
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:33,450
on one way or the other so again here's

664
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:39,030
four more but you can see as we approach

665
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:42,779
the election come the malware so here is

666
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:47,250
just and one effort to see which states

667
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,780
are more at risk currently and you can

668
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,600
see I'll just point out that

669
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,110
Nevada that's envy you can see more

670
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:59,370
worms are being pumped in there than any

671
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:03,510
other state right more viruses into MT

672
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:06,569
or Montana so this may mean that those

673
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:10,070
states are a particular focus for

674
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:14,250
hackers who are trying to insert malware

675
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:15,990
into that Network space right so pay

676
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:20,190
attention when you look at your own logs

677
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:24,779
or your own city or country when you see

678
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:28,770
worm activity especially that is of high

679
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:32,520
interest right because either by

680
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:36,960
accident or on purpose malware is coming

681
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,450
in to your space so I'm getting right

682
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,510
near the end of the talk and so all I'm

683
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:50,299
gonna say is that that the internet I

684
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:50,300
hope is more good than bad right is

685
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:59,450
between online education information

686
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:03,980
sharing etc is information technology

687
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:07,169
hopefully is great for the planet

688
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:10,230
currently though I think authoritarian

689
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:14,760
regimes and dictatorships are using the

690
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:18,510
Internet as a surveillance tool and as a

691
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,300
means of intimidation right I see you

692
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,700
right the United States evidently just

693
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:28,230
sent Russian hackers according to the

694
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:31,680
news an email or a text message saying

695
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:36,060
we see you please don't influence our

696
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:41,450
upcoming election right well at the end

697
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:45,210
of spirited away zero gets the magic

698
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:48,509
hair tie right that she gets to take

699
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:52,530
back with her into the human world and

700
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:56,010
so to some degree information technology

701
00:39:52,530 --> 00:40:00,660
in a modern sense is magic right it

702
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:03,630
really is if you think about a an attack

703
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,598
that can manipulate infrastructure and

704
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:09,150
yet on your screen tell you that the

705
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,609
infrastructure is working fine while

706
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:15,359
this is magic because you as the owner

707
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:19,589
of the car or the house or the company

708
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,440
thinks everything is ok but in fact the

709
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:24,720
hackers are manipulating your foundation

710
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,260
right are you our critical

711
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:32,730
infrastructure so it's hard to know at

712
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:37,410
this point in time is it mostly good or

713
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:41,099
mostly bad but we do know that it's

714
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:44,368
powerful and in many ways it's magic so

715
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:46,079
I will leave you there many thanks for

716
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:47,700
listening to the presentation and if

717
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,640
you're interested in this kind of

718
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,879
research by all means send me an email

719
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:58,529
or a text I've got about four million

720
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,109
machines reporting every day and I pull

721
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:05,190
information from around the world

722
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:07,288
looking for this kind of activity and so

723
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,779
as you can see with the swing states I'm

724
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:12,059
trying to do some prediction as well

725
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:14,369
right so it's not just historical

726
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:19,260
analysis but we can see where the

727
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:26,010
attacks and the hackers are going so the

728
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:29,339
power the persistence of giro right

729
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:31,589
think about it as some inspiration ok

730
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:35,009
and I'm happy to take your questions now

731
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:38,599
or this evening over a drink or by email

732
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,599
next week thank you

733
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,509
[Applause]

734
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:45,819
you

735
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,819
[Applause]
