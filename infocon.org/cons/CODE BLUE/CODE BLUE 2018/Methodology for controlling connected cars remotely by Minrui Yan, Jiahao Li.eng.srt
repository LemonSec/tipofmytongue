1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,240
hello everyone

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,080
thanks for being here to listen our

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,769
topic

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,860
I'm Iranian and he's my coworker

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,650
Chihuly we are foreign the similar same

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,500
team called the skagle team and we're

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,830
glad to be here today we will talk about

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:32,910
our mythology about how to control

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:35,670
connected vehicle remotely in this talk

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,970
we will introduce our team and what we

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,850
have done first then talk about what he

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:46,230
is telematics what inside and how it

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:49,620
works at the attack surface section we

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,040
will talk about security risks and

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,489
vulnerabilities of using software and

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,430
hardware in telematics finally we use

17
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,578
you.thank case to show what we have done

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:09,890
how to how we can conserve vehicle

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:13,350
remotely and execute orders who we are

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,630
we're on schedule she must work on

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,298
security team focus on will call

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,798
security research and the evaluation and

23
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,470
defense in this yes we have some

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,290
research about the vehicle security and

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,110
Tesla Model S hacked to start with our

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,350
key in 2014

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,960
remote control worker we are telematics

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:44,149
in 20th of 15 and can trust our

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,059
autonomous vehicle in 2016 this is an

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:54,119
attack on Italian Tesla's autopilot

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:02:01,439
system and camp ik is true for

32
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:04,829
evaluating campus in 20 year 2017 a tech

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,068
surface for connected vehicle in 2017

34
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,609
and we also have some security products

35
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:15,280
such as campus

36
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,700
welcome guide and you well a numerical

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:24,400
Network defense and security developed

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:30,790
man kids and these are our clans and the

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:36,370
partners okay let's have a look at what

40
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,920
hits connected vehicle so what is

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,660
connecting vehicle in short coverage

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,679
Telemachus so what is telematics

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:50,290
telemetry is a term that compares what

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,300
telecommunications and informatics it

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,970
has a lot of functions these

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,800
technologies used in our daily life

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:04,950
including taxi taxi XPrize vehicle

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:08,350
checking and even remote control so

49
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,459
maybe you buy a new car you can control

50
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:16,290
your car you tell your you telephone

51
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,290
open the door remotely and start engine

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,959
this is a simple image to show what is

53
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:27,549
telematics there are several key points

54
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:31,959
in this image the first key key point in

55
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,790
telematics it's AI so what is away I've

56
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,299
asked them for you working for him

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,480
insist on it always a bigger screen in

58
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,100
your car and you can use it to navigate

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,238
country the vehicle monitor the cost

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,630
dates instant modern cars I also can

61
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,360
send and receive can campus message

62
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,859
because you if you want to control cars

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:01,840
such as oven chanc and open open door

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:06,579
you can use your away to just click

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:10,600
screen and and aware sent a message to

66
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:15,280
in welcome network then the content are

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:20,349
open so I write it either

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,488
it's a operating system include Android

69
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,789
QX

70
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:27,669
will see and other scenes most of there

71
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,540
isten so it means that they may have

72
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,990
lots of an abilities and by the way in

73
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:38,830
different countries and regions aware

74
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:43,570
has different name such as a qu da or

75
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:47,349
say say idea atchoo means head unit it's

76
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:52,690
almost a widely known ta dis display

77
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:59,980
audio form we see this term in Japanese

78
00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:04,030
car and CID and for Tesla the second key

79
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:08,670
point is ESP ESP could store your user

80
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:13,090
data and and analyze them for providing

81
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:15,660
service so so that they may have your

82
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,119
cell achieve data like your German pass

83
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,650
they could know where you went last

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,300
night in some case you could install our

85
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,710
application your smartphone and use it

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:36,840
to get your car status and control your

87
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:42,039
car remotely in a lot of cloud service

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,469
the next key point is telematics box the

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,050
telev matrix box is a key point in

90
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,400
telematics system because it's a

91
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:54,790
connecting vehicle network and the inter

92
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,880
external network if tell me Taichi

93
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,640
box-to-box is compromised attacks could

94
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,170
connect to in working network and the

95
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:09,840
cover under the control of that text so

96
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:14,880
the attack could use G box to Stinson

97
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:19,150
kimba's message and he could control car

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,990
the key box is something somewhere in

99
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,120
the car it is support for data

100
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,700
collection and help you control on

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,510
country the car remote area it also has

102
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,419
the NTC function by monitoring the cars

103
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:37,090
the COS daters

104
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,139
gbox who can send him bass message to

105
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,359
the car happen

106
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,199
happy to open door study enjoyment

107
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:48,279
remotely basically she box your internet

108
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:52,779
internet access to our eye Sochi box is

109
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:55,389
the critical point in telematics after

110
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:58,090
understanding the rule of this device

111
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:03,370
let's talk about how they links with

112
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:06,849
each other this imagery is a map of an

113
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:12,699
American network this block represents

114
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:15,938
you ECU different mode of all cars has

115
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:18,909
different in welcome network maps this

116
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:21,400
image is just a simple map the real in

117
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:25,080
vehicle network is more complicated than

118
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,429
this one there are some different

119
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,659
different paths in your vehicle such as

120
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:36,969
Ken chambers lean is the net flux where

121
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:41,860
most the net denouement network the

122
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:44,620
network connect Ezio's issues if you

123
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,589
like if you like too much monitor your

124
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,250
car you must know what he is your

125
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:54,969
turning however you see also we talked

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:00,430
about today do not include engine

127
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:04,379
control unit well in welcome network

128
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,139
gateway many functions are you so easily

129
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:11,199
different networks and for what data

130
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:15,279
party control module could control the

131
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,990
door states loops track and some other

132
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:24,849
things and head unit is in different

133
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:27,310
network with the PCM if we want to open

134
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,020
the door remotely once you need to do it

135
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,509
using the application you're in your

136
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,500
phone so we have seen that commander to

137
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:39,820
TSP the TSP will generate our command to

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:45,010
key box 20 box will generate a Kempis

139
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:47,709
message to members at least at last

140
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:52,380
issues will follow this campus message

141
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:52,380
and execute command to open the door

142
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:01,480
so how to start a research if you want

143
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:04,900
to style your vehicle research you may

144
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:09,100
have a question could I the car of

145
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:12,310
course if you don't afraid of doing or

146
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,830
doing damage in your car

147
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,000
but something sometimes we don't have

148
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:21,630
have to do the research in a new car all

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,870
you need is a simulation environment

150
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:27,939
ever give you some advices to build a

151
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,350
simulation environment we need to have

152
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:37,060
some parts from Oriakhi you can buy car

153
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:42,279
parts on eBay or Alibaba and Thabo in

154
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:46,589
West Bishop this is the planet a you can

155
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:51,040
buy for under all night on land market

156
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:55,060
plant beans out at parts market it's a

157
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,900
fly the better choice is auto parts

158
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:02,410
market of life they have different car

159
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:07,180
from the world and they take them apart

160
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:11,290
and serve the parts in China we can bear

161
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:14,560
almost any part from the market and the

162
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:21,310
price much cheaper then replacement

163
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:26,199
parts odeon 4s shop we need to prepare

164
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:30,359
this to us to disabled cars part and the

165
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,870
pity be such as the stateís save

166
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:39,839
Twitter's digital multimeter Carter

167
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:43,540
Shepherd to us soldering station

168
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:50,500
preacher and so on this to us we are

169
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:53,890
spend about 1 1000 1000 bucks the

170
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,850
beautiful Asian environment sometimes we

171
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,560
need to connection connect some

172
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,560
information from our real car by doing

173
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,170
this we can find out where at the device

174
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,988
and how they link to which each other

175
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:15,248
and how they works to make sure parts

176
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:18,730
can ring outside of the car we need to

177
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:21,579
know what his operating conditions for

178
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:26,040
the parts this could be sound signals

179
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:30,279
from different ECU the most important

180
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:34,079
the most important since its enable

181
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:37,540
signals the Muslim able the most

182
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:41,248
important in a box economy needs Campus

183
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,618
message so we need to use digital

184
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:48,429
multimeter to find out which can nectar

185
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:53,199
is connected through the campus then we

186
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:58,419
can we can use campus transceiver to

187
00:11:53,199 --> 00:12:03,008
receive a to decode campus message key

188
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:06,220
message you can be pretty oak and a

189
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:10,299
prettier message of check the message

190
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:14,079
the message can keep the ECU raining in

191
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:20,949
the individual the trickle message could

192
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:27,579
wake up or shut down the ECU this is man

193
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:30,998
chat of can message so you have to

194
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:34,599
record a message before before you start

195
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:38,999
engine and the Yury costs you careful

196
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:44,259
well and then you start engine and also

197
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:46,869
and then we call our other data packet

198
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:49,899
and diffident so you can maybe you can

199
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:55,929
find some different that is that is the

200
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:59,759
results you need connector issues

201
00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:03,419
according to the real car and supply the

202
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,220
DC power then you need to keep standing

203
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:10,139
enable signal that you found from the

204
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:14,709
real car in this figure we used our

205
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:18,640
stm32 to send camp bus message to tee

206
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:21,819
box this is a wake up commander

207
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,230
in campus message this is a very simple

208
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:30,460
case in other complicated case

209
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:33,550
Mauricio's I'll request okay let's talk

210
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:38,370
about a text surface and generally will

211
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:42,130
take away from here all right

212
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,790
the to thundered attack surfaces for

213
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,630
kinetic connecting a car you should

214
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:52,750
collect the PCB components information

215
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:56,320
including the processor /ic interfaces

216
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,990
then you can analyze the architecture so

217
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,380
that you are able to know which I see is

218
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,660
wrong and finally we can analyze the

219
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,480
vulnerabilities from the thunder from

220
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,530
where we mailing first on that he was

221
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:16,090
the a VI and the TSP adjust server

222
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:19,600
diagrams of their architecture let's

223
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:21,300
take a look what what is in dirty bath

224
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,560
and what they can do

225
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:29,979
usually the I'm silk net to the SOC

226
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:34,839
virus the report the associate Dennis

227
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:41,290
system Oh cheap and the report is your

228
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:44,740
GPL and they all connect either with

229
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:51,250
their internet which the tables connect

230
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:56,470
to our we have avi via USB this is a USB

231
00:14:51,250 --> 00:15:00,370
port and I'm CEO sent messages by Ken

232
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:05,170
chassis ver then the photo program runs

233
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:11,280
on the SOC and is able to upgrade MCU

234
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:15,099
and RBI as they embed the device it also

235
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:19,569
it also has some debug port for flashing

236
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:22,690
from where and on ship debugging and it

237
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:25,930
always has a system such as the Linux

238
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,980
large enjoyed you can found it in a

239
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,979
flash memory chip

240
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:39,500
I left this this is a theme embed the

241
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:42,930
SIM card we can identify the ship by the

242
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:46,940
packaging to use the theme of tea balls

243
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:50,579
we need to prepare the LTE modem device

244
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:56,819
you can be unlucky the 4G Wi-Fi dongle

245
00:15:50,579 --> 00:16:00,540
or 4G LTE module or a mobile phone with

246
00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:04,920
SIM card slot by children you need to

247
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:08,939
get the right APN configurations so

248
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:13,620
what's the APN AP n stands for access

249
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:17,009
point name it is the same it is the name

250
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,800
of the gateway internet service provider

251
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:24,000
Crusader different APM for different

252
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:28,008
network situation some sensitive devices

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,350
using the 4G module combined with APN

254
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:34,589
make the network convenient safe and

255
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:39,120
reliable such other ATM path and

256
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:43,529
telematics TSP Kuna to the vehicles via

257
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,750
the MSTP leased line list the line the

258
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,500
most evilest line you can see in the

259
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,720
peak in this picture is gie tunnel so we

260
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,360
can use it to connect you the

261
00:16:51,720 --> 00:17:02,490
automaker's internet and the fund

262
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:05,610
something interesting the TSP was to

263
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:10,169
attack because it has many essential

264
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:14,369
services in related to the network of

265
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:18,630
suppliers and automakers and penetrating

266
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:21,418
is easier for security researcher for

267
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,360
the ape for app store we can the App

268
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:27,659
Store is left for the App Store we can

269
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,570
play an app with backdoor for the user

270
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:33,990
Center we can get a privacy information

271
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:37,470
of users include

272
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:41,820
the car app token so you can request the

273
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,750
API to control car with this token for

274
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,629
the

275
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,929
from where over the airserver photo we

276
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:53,730
can penetrate it and put my shoes

277
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:56,640
upgrade the packages on it only we had

278
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,880
Jack the remoter series we can can show

279
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,049
car remotely and if we attack the

280
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,350
suppliers in network we can scale our

281
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:10,799
scale our attack in other words if your

282
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:14,520
suppliers provide a service services for

283
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:17,730
automaker a and automaker B you can

284
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,059
control both the vehicles of the

285
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:24,990
automakers and we have done that

286
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:29,280
you must think it's not easier to to

287
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:33,419
access the Internet there are five words

288
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,799
IPS ideas and woth but I tell you it's

289
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:43,409
possible we found a way to we found a

290
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:45,570
way to access the Internet by biochip

291
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:47,460
acid which has a pian configurations and

292
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:53,100
it's difficult to chase back attack

293
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:56,730
source this is a the architecture of a

294
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:00,059
VI the inside of a VR has divided two

295
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:03,450
parts the operate the operating system

296
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:09,418
ransom and see you of core board this is

297
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:13,169
cobalt and the EMS emmc usually contains

298
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:18,330
operating system the display managed by

299
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:22,980
MPU and the power manager by MCU only

300
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:25,830
button board and and I'm I'm puking

301
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,950
attitude MCU usually with a PCB

302
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,320
connector you composed of some

303
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:37,799
interfaces such as you arch

304
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:39,480
SDIO I equals C sit ha as well I'm

305
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,570
serious in the current message is also

306
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:48,210
bio can transceiver you see the

307
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:51,809
transceiver ok for common avi we can

308
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:56,460
plug a USB internet dongle into the

309
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,879
media port of avi and the embedded

310
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,730
system

311
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:07,350
maybe not verified of Eid vendor ID and

312
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:10,830
the product ID of the USB device they

313
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:14,820
convey Adi and PRD sent you the linux to

314
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:19,590
default drivers the IVR system can

315
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,990
recognize the USB device as eth0 the

316
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:25,678
default network configuration results in

317
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:31,559
that the self assign a static IP address

318
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:37,350
or obtain an IP address from DHCP you so

319
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:43,009
we can scan the network services in WLAN

320
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:45,990
or wider Ethernet the a DVD or sshd

321
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:49,679
usually without authentication and we

322
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:53,190
can get her show easily on the other

323
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:58,049
side the other suppliers may may keep

324
00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:02,820
hiding and she on system UI only touch

325
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:03,418
the edge of securing regularly touch for

326
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,668
example

327
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:10,200
touch up up down down left right left

328
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:11,759
right B a so you can get her shell for

329
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,799
some area you can get a shot that is

330
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:20,720
cheek then we need a plug a keyboard or

331
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:25,649
mouse to input a command on the terminal

332
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,710
only PCB boards like this on the PCB

333
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:34,559
borders there are perhaps you are ported

334
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:40,019
on the side of SOC TDY console lost on

335
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:47,070
this port you can use the USB adapter to

336
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:49,259
access the debug sure it's by that we

337
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,320
can also read the memory Wayne is

338
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:56,940
running the device in this picture is a

339
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,730
USB DM freescale and refresh - firmware

340
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:06,539
instead if you wanna add a backdoor you

341
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:09,690
can do it this is the USB port you can

342
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,540
see in this diagram usually the typical

343
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,490
net you

344
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:18,670
as Randy's device and avianna to the

345
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:21,660
internet via tea box

346
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:26,020
the PID and the reality are private

347
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:29,890
possible so here are two ways to attack

348
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:34,210
the structure for the IVR we can

349
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:38,980
customize an embedded device with custom

350
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:43,240
VRD and PID in USB whitelist such as

351
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:46,120
smart phone or raspberry pi so the IVR

352
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,890
can recognize the malicious USB device

353
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:53,649
as randy's device for the t-boz we can

354
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,150
modify the drivers to apply the Tibbals

355
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:01,480
then we can control the device via a DB

356
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:05,230
or SSH and we can pan share the TSP

357
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:08,830
while he was in network the automotive

358
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:13,960
USB connector is usually not the USB

359
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:17,980
standard perhaps it is a round shape HSD

360
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,560
connector or square head rolls connector

361
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,910
so you can make it works by jumping

362
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:32,110
worth two USB type-c cable in this

363
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:34,960
picture the porting red looks like a HSD

364
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:38,379
interface but actually it's a USB

365
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:43,170
interface we only need to make a cable

366
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:47,710
USB to HSD and connect to our computer

367
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:51,450
use the adb command then we will net you

368
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:55,060
that he was in a ghetto root privilege

369
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,520
you need to analyze the system file to

370
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,280
fund more vulnerabilities if you don't

371
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,330
get a debug straddle actually you could

372
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:07,990
down the firmware by programmers or card

373
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:11,439
reader at the left the picture merely

374
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,450
shows flash room programmers at the

375
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,440
right the photo shows the

376
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:22,020
microcontroller programmers this to us

377
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,020
cheap and suitable for most chips

378
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:30,020
here is a reading for SD card reading

379
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,260
files for SD card is amazing

380
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:38,520
this board is Tesla and we found two as

381
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:42,030
the cards on it in left SD card I found

382
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:47,430
many seals from we're showing the rudder

383
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:49,889
image you can see a little harder if we

384
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,550
get a low key the card the logic

385
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:56,180
analyzer is a great tool we are able to

386
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:59,570
sniff the password from the

387
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:03,030
communication between SD card and a host

388
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:06,860
in this graph the password transmitted

389
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,690
on the data channel 0 you see this green

390
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,320
so we parted a password did have flown

391
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:17,610
the logic analyzer patching the SD card

392
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,490
driver English raspberry pi system we're

393
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,600
inserting a Logitech SD card it can be

394
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:27,540
and Lockheed automatically so we can

395
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:34,290
moon monkeys partition successfully and

396
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:36,780
we can read a file it's common that

397
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:40,649
oughta make her put firmware into flash

398
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,190
room the fresh room stores important

399
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,320
data

400
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:47,580
well done in the firmware from flash

401
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:53,669
room is the first stage checking the

402
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:57,840
brands brands and data code on the IC IC

403
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:01,200
and then we can google write data sheets

404
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,010
on the IC of the IC according to the

405
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,460
ping assignments we can know what

406
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:12,180
protocol did he use and know what is

407
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,710
useful is per room or bridge operating

408
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,800
system or cage

409
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:24,390
and we can use the right programmer -

410
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:27,930
Tom - Thunder from where the Tesla runs

411
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:30,420
the Linux on NVIDIA core board we take

412
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:33,870
of the image emmc by a BGA rework

413
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,780
station use small words the BGA rework

414
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,929
station

415
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,980
it's a super holiday account after you

416
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:44,620
Thunder from where by the programmer

417
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:48,010
reporting Darcy so we can fix it and

418
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:52,320
make the working again so we need in the

419
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,320
to purchase a second at Tesla ceoddi

420
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:00,580
this picture shows Tesla I'm Emma C

421
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:04,890
files weeks chatted instructed the right

422
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:10,060
the route hashing the shadow file and

423
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:13,300
the browser dynamic library in other

424
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,090
directory is the WebKit kernel you can

425
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:20,860
debug the browser cannot on your

426
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:24,120
simulator the NAND flash program is a

427
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:27,939
little expensive forgiving with the PC

428
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:31,120
3000 the flash program is about three

429
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,210
thousand bucks and it maybe not a

430
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,530
complete compatible with some NAND flash

431
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:41,640
you can replace it with an evolution

432
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:46,930
port such as the Raspberry Pi Arduino

433
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:53,290
stm32 by jumping was to the GPIO we can

434
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:55,870
read the blocks of NAND flash there are

435
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,860
also some differences between different

436
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:04,209
from where it's too complicated to talk

437
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:07,750
about let me just mention to you the

438
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:10,870
common analyzing methods you should Alex

439
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:14,170
Jada from where first if you don't know

440
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:17,350
what the firmware is used to being work

441
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:20,290
or strings if you know the firmware

442
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,260
contains partitions you can use mounted

443
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:26,610
commands and a DD command or nano

444
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,750
simulator driver to man ubi file system

445
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:33,669
then you can reverse engineering

446
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:35,920
programs or put a lot of by these come

447
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,860
on to us you may ask how do you know

448
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,190
which to analyzed if you know about

449
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,428
embedded development you mustn't know

450
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:47,800
that system driver is the key so we can

451
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:51,100
analyze the program how how

452
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:55,300
driver the MCU by the way we can fund

453
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:58,360
the TSP configurations use TS feet don't

454
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:01,930
you captured data if the data is

455
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:08,199
encrypted you can reverse the suffered a

456
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:10,410
logarithm occurred according to the

457
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,530
architecture and tech services

458
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,070
aforementioned

459
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:18,550
we are able to hack a real car

460
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:23,129
here are four real cases and the

461
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,129
sensitive information has been removed

462
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,129
there is another way to get APN

463
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,879
configuration we can sniff the your

464
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:37,720
communication between MCU and our team

465
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:41,320
module then the 80 command printed on

466
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,900
the console the condenser an APN

467
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,820
configuration we can jump where fro and

468
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:51,670
you seem to a phone SIM card slot then

469
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:56,710
configurating the APM own the mobile

470
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:59,140
phone in this case there is achieve made

471
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,370
by freescale we found a debug approach

472
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:06,130
which is not disabled that we need we

473
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:09,760
need a more professional tool to down

474
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:13,000
the firmware we can also gather appear

475
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:19,570
from the initial firmware is planned

476
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:23,020
text in red you can see in this image we

477
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:28,149
could fund some services is running and

478
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:30,879
listening in 0 0 0 0 as previously

479
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:34,750
mentioned our devices in the same

480
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,850
internet not internal intranet it means

481
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,450
you have access to connected their

482
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:42,669
services via APN in other words you can

483
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:48,460
attack other tasks typically

484
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:51,640
tipple sees in the same internet by

485
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,070
funding the configuration files we could

486
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,970
know some sensitive information about

487
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:00,810
API or other things in this case I got

488
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,910
lots of administrator dashboard and

489
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:07,810
foundational services such as topics and

490
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:12,250
a good lab it's easier for webcast to do

491
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:14,830
something interesting so you know how to

492
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,200
access the automaker's engineering are

493
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:22,659
different away then I will show you the

494
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,080
kiss 2tsp first we jump the word to the

495
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:29,170
theme after setting the APN we can

496
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:34,500
assess the Internet you can see that

497
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:38,140
delay time is not a bad so we can again

498
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,870
sugandha internet by a theme finally we

499
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:45,300
gotta prove we got a root privileges of

500
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:48,610
we're cooking away server by long-time

501
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,490
penetration long time penetration and we

502
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,580
found terrible things the kiparis is

503
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:57,130
daughter keep housing the server they

504
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,980
did either for convenience but it's in

505
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:05,950
security we can login mostly leaning

506
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:09,330
server of this resource group also the

507
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:12,220
key server site in the internet the

508
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:16,120
proxy service between vehicle be the way

509
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:19,710
and the tea box we funded the command

510
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,770
server finally maliki the communication

511
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:27,100
message between vehicle getaway and

512
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:30,540
command server is HTTP and his Pilate is

513
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,730
plain text so we can analyze each Italy

514
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,879
we send a command to our car then

515
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:40,780
capture the corresponding pillows by

516
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,810
Wireshark and we fund all the command

517
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:47,560
names the command server send commands

518
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:51,310
to we I could get away with token the

519
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:54,970
tokens are the operation ID and the CMD

520
00:32:51,310 --> 00:33:02,530
ID we call it command Rd in this picture

521
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:05,770
you can see CMD ID in writer window the

522
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:09,760
operation ID is fixed by specific R

523
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:14,950
versus the commonality is the real token

524
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:20,740
generated by data center we Lotus

525
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:24,340
- to control car the method of sindh is

526
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:27,659
to compose commands for controlling car

527
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,459
it is in the parameters including vr

528
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:35,740
operation time Irish operation content

529
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:39,340
command tokens and the time stamp but he

530
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,799
not always success as we expected we

531
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:46,240
found that it will do the success only

532
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:50,019
if we have send a command by official

533
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,210
mobile application before finally we

534
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:56,080
found that the tables will sleep

535
00:33:52,210 --> 00:34:02,110
automatically and we need to send a we

536
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:06,668
have command - that he was at first the

537
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:10,449
wick observer provides API the payload

538
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:12,730
format is familiar with the previews the

539
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:16,149
most important parameter is the phone

540
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:20,730
number and the parameter a PB key Sian

541
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:24,159
token is for the third party M SMS API

542
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:28,449
so you know the week hub command is

543
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:31,480
based on SMS and you can recover tables

544
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:34,868
by your phone but you had better not to

545
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,839
hacking with your chases by the way a

546
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:42,010
Connect connect connect either car can

547
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:45,369
also be controlled by SMS it seems like

548
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:48,159
a live chat you send opening the door

549
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:50,919
and then that he possibly apply the the

550
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,919
door is opened you missing he it is

551
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:59,470
ridiculous but it's better designs were

552
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:02,230
really existent you may not understand

553
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:07,810
the control procedure don't worry

554
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:10,839
a Joris simple flow chart chart the

555
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:14,440
process servers and the internet service

556
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,170
provider and panel are omitted the

557
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,470
controlling server also a meeting all

558
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,990
you need to her focus is the

559
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,540
getaway and the wake up server the

560
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,939
mobile application ascended the control

561
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,579
command to application

562
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,910
back-end server then the backhander

563
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:38,050
server requests the command to TS speak

564
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:42,250
it away you can see the step 1 on this

565
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,750
chart request the phone number just PK

566
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,349
the way we all look at the phone number

567
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:50,349
from data center the data center is not

568
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:54,069
at the same database server its macro

569
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:57,250
cop cop the services next step

570
00:35:54,069 --> 00:36:00,819
just speak it away Wilson send a wake-up

571
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:06,609
command to wake up server with team us

572
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:08,859
m2m phone number parameter then the T

573
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:15,270
basa will wake up and connect you the

574
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:23,680
TSP get away and the register register

575
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:28,240
services in step 4 then the TSP you will

576
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:33,160
listen a new device event and handle the

577
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,589
commander Q then the request the token

578
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,649
with edelen's

579
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:41,770
pin code and encrypt commanded data

580
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,869
finally the targeted device target of

581
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:52,030
vehicle will receive the commander and

582
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:54,420
return status alright next case is a via

583
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:57,160
the time is not enough so I will spoke

584
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,880
faster if you don't understand you can

585
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,879
ask me later controller connect connect

586
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,190
to the car from TSP combo then I will

587
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,089
show you how to control a connected

588
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:12,940
connected Acharya are we are we found a

589
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:15,279
debug port and we get a little sure then

590
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:19,990
we got a system for a nice enjoyed

591
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,359
system we have analyzed the system file

592
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:26,169
then we fund the server of photo

593
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,480
platform you can see you can see the you

594
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:31,619
are at laughter picture by the way is

595
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,500
HTTP we got a previous order of the

596
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:38,770
platform by force force publishing the

597
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,859
mine shows a vendor system package the a

598
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,319
via updater will verify the signal

599
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:47,069
of the system package but we get a

600
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:49,910
pretty private certificate already so we

601
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:54,140
can say ma'am I just package with legal

602
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:57,149
certificate and gather privileges of IVR

603
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:01,200
generally the control command is seen by

604
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:05,029
the core board is not roll can messages

605
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,919
for Linux week from the char devices

606
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:10,769
name the cam message ID laughter then

607
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,160
you can send command by calling write or

608
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:17,339
i/o control sometimes the instrument

609
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,379
cluster display extended by avi so you

610
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:23,130
can call in the I can show to write a

611
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,730
frame buffer to display anything in this

612
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:30,109
instrument culture you know Angela is

613
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:33,809
based on Linux because the unsafe

614
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:37,890
development habit we can access the char

615
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:40,289
device with sandbox privilege on the

616
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,288
other hand for example the engine

617
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:47,279
service calling source verified and the

618
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:49,230
library can be accessed arbitrary we can

619
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:52,920
send a control command with low

620
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:55,920
privilege but it is not the real key

621
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,339
messages is you are to data the MSE you

622
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,380
own the button board will pass the the

623
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:04,319
other data flowing that they have from

624
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,049
are to sender can messages so we can

625
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:10,410
just just only send the messages

626
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:13,739
predefined by the automaker then what we

627
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:16,609
need to do is to fund control commands

628
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:20,190
so that we can control the car remotely

629
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:23,700
by hijacking the OTA we can inject the

630
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:26,249
backdoor code this code she was calling

631
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,859
the services service for started

632
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:32,069
air-conditioned the command you can get

633
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:37,589
by the the camper decompiling

634
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:40,739
the apk we can fast the UART char device

635
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:42,599
by following the data format this

636
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:46,859
picture shows the data for mother we

637
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:51,529
reversed this head bias is double FWA

638
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:54,058
and the last body is a checksum

639
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:54,690
then we go to value the commander and

640
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,450
ascended

641
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:00,390
sorry virus just just insert the probe

642
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:04,500
Oh ping into the can cable of the AVR

643
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:07,290
there's three buys corresponding to the

644
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,380
chem message we capture like it can only

645
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:14,580
control the vehicle body but can not

646
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:17,430
affect the power chain so how to affect

647
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:21,930
affected the power chain I will show you

648
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:24,660
another case of RBI connecting our

649
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:28,169
computer into the in-vehicle network

650
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:32,160
campus when we do some actions such as

651
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:36,300
open door turn on the air-condition is

652
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:42,089
it straightforward to know which command

653
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:43,560
is valid you can see in sumeria we have

654
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:47,400
access to sender

655
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,370
the wrong message to campus it not not

656
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,350
you are today is a roll message the

657
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,540
different car has different away for

658
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:58,950
example that he was using the socket

659
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:03,120
again and a serial port can 0 and I can

660
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:07,290
one now let's talk about the attack pass

661
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:09,930
if if hackers can get into vehicle

662
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,390
manufacturers internet they have the

663
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,120
permission to connect you with any

664
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:18,210
vehicle in the internet then they

665
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:22,020
control one of a via RT vosdek has in a

666
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:24,200
canvas message into your car it means

667
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,410
that they can enjoy your career mostly

668
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,500
what I'll share today is controlling a

669
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:33,990
connected a car by existing commands

670
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:37,560
then enough to attack a lower-end

671
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:40,290
connected car actually how to temper MCU

672
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,570
from where and Bob has the verification

673
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:47,180
mechanism is more challenging

674
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,180
I hope share it to you next time
