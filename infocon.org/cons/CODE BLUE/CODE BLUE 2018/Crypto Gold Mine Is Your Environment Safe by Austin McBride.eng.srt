1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,259
thank you um so as she said my name is

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,129
Austin McBride and today we're gonna

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:16,350
talk a little bit about cryptocurrency

4
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:18,000
how it's a gold mine and how you can

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,510
protect a couple of measures you can do

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,350
to protect your environment so first

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,420
we'll talk a little bit about

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,150
cryptocurrency in general and then

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,750
crypto jackin then phishing and then a

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,180
little bit about alternate coins and

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,579
exchanges and then finally about

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,560
measures to protect yourself I'm so a

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,329
little bit of about me one I got

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,430
haircuts so I look a little different

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,970
now but I am a threat analytics

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,910
researcher at Cisco umbrella I have a BS

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,420
and a data mining and economics I really

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,720
love crypto my hobbies are working and

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:58,140
basically algorithmic crypto trading and

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,579
of course work so a little bit about the

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,070
team that I work with

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,890
it's called Cisco guerrilla and we

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,380
basically mix data science and network

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,680
security and so we call that big

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,649
security data we process about a hundred

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,390
and eighty billion DNS queries a day and

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,880
that's roughly a little bit less than

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,369
three percent of daily DNS traffic

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,619
globally um so we get quite a decent

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,920
sample as far as DNS queries are

31
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,450
concerned we also see a lot of new

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,900
domains that have never there have just

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,030
been registered and have not really been

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,140
visited frequently and now that we're a

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,360
part of Cisco before we were Open DNS

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,310
now we have all of Cisco's data as well

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,400
daily activities for myself and other

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,700
people on my team are security analysis

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,869
distributed systems Big Data engineering

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,210
and data visualization so a little bit

41
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,280
about cryptocurrency so as we all know

42
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,740
cryptocurrency had a pretty meteoric

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,470
rise it's not quite there at the moment

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,810
it's about 200 billion but within a one

45
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,700
year period we went from 26 billion in

46
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,619
market cap all the way to eight hundred

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,119
thirty-five billion which is not

48
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,910
something that we've ever really seen in

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,880
other traditional markets so so with

50
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,250
this

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,930
there's a lot of opportunity right for

52
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,170
anybody to make money in especially

53
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,150
malicious actors so with the going

54
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,040
mainstream and becoming more popular a

55
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,800
lot of individuals are going to get into

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,079
the space and it's going to be a ripe

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,940
spot for malicious actors to go and take

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,720
advantage of people who don't know much

59
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,760
about blockchain or cryptocurrencies it

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,350
is under regulated and it's highly

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,850
volatile and there are a lot of

62
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,910
malicious actors that are willing to

63
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,530
steal your funds so I'm gonna talk a

64
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,320
little bit about crypt currency

65
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,960
regulation so to start off with I think

66
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,600
Japan has the most comprehensive

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,230
structure at the moment for regulating

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,910
especially exchanges and I think it's

69
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,000
great I would say that in most other

70
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,640
countries are not anywhere near the

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,830
understanding of blockchain or exactly

72
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,589
how to regulate it especially with the

73
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,410
the different governing bodies so it's

74
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,970
kind of a an idea right we started off

75
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,500
with the mountain ox compromise

76
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,570
anticipate EF guidance risk-based

77
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,550
approach to cryptocurrencies and 15 very

78
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,829
progressive and then the payment

79
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,020
services act in 2017

80
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:29,140
now everyone goes a lot of people go

81
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,760
through know your customer everything is

82
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,000
complying to anti money laundering

83
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,120
rules and then there are frequent audits

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,350
to make sure that the books look okay

85
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,260
then we had coin check of course that

86
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,460
happened in January and then the GVC EA

87
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,769
and March of 2018 generally where there

88
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,330
is money there will be malicious actors

89
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:53,590
that want to take it from you right and

90
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,690
in this case most of it's going to be

91
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,310
external most of the threats that you'll

92
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,660
see that involve cryptocurrencies in

93
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,940
your environments are probably not going

94
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,930
to come from Japan most likely is going

95
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,660
to come from Ukraine or another foreign

96
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,430
operator that is just operating in your

97
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,400
environment as much as possible to to

98
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,110
steal funds so the reason one of the

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,048
reasons that it's actually so attractive

100
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,400
is that it's it's very lucrative and it

101
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,858
can be hard to spot if you don't know

102
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,469
what you're looking for

103
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,180
Krypto exchanges do not necessarily have

104
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:28,810
his robust security measures in place

105
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,080
the traditional equity markets do stocks

106
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,419
bonds you know etc and so it's it's very

107
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,750
easy for malicious actors who have an

108
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:40,060
understanding of that to easily

109
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,810
infiltrate and steal funds it's also

110
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,240
very anonymous depending on the coin and

111
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,319
with an asset valuation that fluctuates

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,240
quite a lot you can basically steal

113
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,330
coins and in two or three days or a week

114
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,550
they can be thirty percent or thirty

115
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,438
percent more than they were originally

116
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,080
so it's very very lucrative and it can

117
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,580
be used to of course buy Lamborghinis

118
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,409
and things like that but it can also be

119
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,020
used to buy additional malware or

120
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:11,560
infrastructure to make even more impact

121
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,750
and damages so now I'm going to talk a

122
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,560
little bit about how crypto jackin fits

123
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:21,279
in to the mix I'm sure you were all very

124
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,379
aware but the basics of crypto mining is

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,319
basically you're verifying transactions

126
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,539
of others and then you've rewarded for

127
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,800
verifying those transactions in the case

128
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:34,000
of Bitcoin it kind of can differ

129
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,400
depending on what coin crypto jackin is

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,440
really just the hijacking of computer

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,698
resources and there are a few other

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,129
speakers that talked about this in the

133
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,750
conference and basically it's just using

134
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:51,189
your GPU CPU or cloud computing services

135
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,169
to to mine cryptocurrency so keeping in

136
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:55,629
mind with about a hundred eighty billion

137
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,490
DNS queries we see a day we seemed a

138
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:01,000
tremendous increase in the amount of

139
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,789
crypto traffic just in the last eight

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,740
months and the majority of the traffic

141
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:08,229
is from Kempton mining pools we see a

142
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,800
lot of manure of course and some other

143
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:15,490
coins and they actually happen to affect

144
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,580
a lot of different industries it's not

145
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,949
just financial services health care a

146
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,240
wide variety of industries all are

147
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,069
seeing this type of traffic in their

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,939
environment and there are also some mmm

149
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,789
malicious actors that are dropping

150
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:32,360
mining software and it persists in your

151
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,430
environment as long as it's connected

152
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:41,030
Internet so looking at a distribution of

153
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:43,069
industry in the u.s. specifically and in

154
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,989
Europe you can see that higher education

155
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,409
energy and utility companies that

156
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,060
typically have hardware that is older

157
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:52,780
and not necessarily patched as as

158
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,180
frequently as it could be healthcare

159
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,500
have surprisingly and hold quite large

160
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,930
percentages of the amount of traffic

161
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,780
that we've seen cumulative ly over the

162
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,419
last eight months the top industries

163
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,279
kind of fluctuate as we can see from the

164
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,229
last two or three months or every two or

165
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,379
three months they fluctuate but higher

166
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:15,529
education is almost always on top so

167
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:17,569
this means students who have free

168
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:19,960
electricity and then free internet and

169
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:22,520
their dormitories or running mining rigs

170
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:27,049
and so this can be costly for our

171
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,180
educational institutions looking at the

172
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,330
kind of geo distribution of the traffic

173
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:35,180
we see a lot happening in the US and in

174
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:38,180
European countries as far as crypto

175
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,580
mining goes that is malicious in nature

176
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,889
not necessarily global crypto mining

177
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,258
traffic and as you can see here we've

178
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,580
got a bar chart of a couple of the

179
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,009
different country codes that we see

180
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:54,080
quite a bit of traffic in I'm so you may

181
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:57,020
ask yourself what type of company is

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,289
most targeted for crypto mining activity

183
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,599
and I would say that it predominantly is

184
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:05,449
focused on smaller businesses or

185
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,819
medium-sized businesses and the reason

186
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,830
for this is generally those businesses

187
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,199
do not have dedicated incident

188
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,938
responders people who were monitoring

189
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,729
network traffic making sure things are

190
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,129
actually consistently working as they

191
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:22,639
should and so that is why we see

192
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:24,560
normally companies 10,000 employees or

193
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:30,199
less or being targeted for this type of

194
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:33,890
activity we can also see that with with

195
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,079
the use of mining pools for you know

196
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,088
Minero and some other types of coins

197
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:40,640
that you can line the market

198
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,319
fluctuations in value and the difficulty

199
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,699
of the mining can actually impact

200
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:46,709
whether or not you seeing that traffic

201
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,860
environment so when the market is down

202
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,960
and the mining difficulty is high you

203
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,730
will see less you will be less a risk

204
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,970
for this type of activity or environment

205
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,760
but when the market cap is going up and

206
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,500
we're approaching 1 trillion in market

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,450
cap you're going to see a lot more

208
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,300
crypto mining in your environments

209
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:10,320
because it is cheaper to to operate and

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,469
more lucrative and we've also seen that

211
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,050
as the market has taken a dip recently

212
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:21,180
and overall value for cryptocurrencies

213
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,910
we see a lot more fishing so so mining

214
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,550
costs do you think ok you might ask well

215
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,280
how much does this really cost malicious

216
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,280
actors to to mine in my environment and

217
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,069
really the cost is is pretty negligible

218
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,150
using popular web liners like coin hive

219
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,190
or there are several that you could use

220
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:44,520
generally they'll take maybe 30% of

221
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,870
whatever you mind as a fee and then the

222
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,750
rest of it they can put in their pocket

223
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,500
and then the upfront cost of them

224
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,780
getting this mining software whether

225
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,130
it's JavaScript or physical malware

226
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,589
software in your environment is really

227
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,450
just the cost of how very long it takes

228
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,810
their time and money to get into your

229
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,690
environment this is this is coin high

230
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:11,400
very popular online miner in mines

231
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,220
monaro and here we can see that really

232
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,110
it's not necessarily just larger

233
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,270
corporations and servers and AWS

234
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,600
instances that are being targeted we see

235
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:25,020
this happening in smartphones we see it

236
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,430
on websites is JavaScript exploits and

237
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,199
then individual machine targeting you've

238
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,739
probably seen a lot of new stories about

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,220
different breaches and hacks some are in

240
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,070
cloud AWS instances with basically weak

241
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,460
kubernetes passwords right but we also

242
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,940
see malicious actors infiltrating sites

243
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,880
that deliver content like video as well

244
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,470
as news websites where they know that

245
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,840
the user is going to be on that domain

246
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,040
for at least 30 minutes to an hour

247
00:10:54,840 --> 00:12:31,790
consuming content that way they maximize

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:12:33,319
they're machine based on the query so it

249
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,689
means that one either an employee

250
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,610
installed mining software in your

251
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,819
environment and they shouldn't have or

252
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,649
to an external party was able to get

253
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,439
into your environment install software

254
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,449
and they are sending the funds that

255
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,579
they're mining in your environment

256
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:52,010
externally so with the the second case

257
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:54,380
scenario is much worse because if it is

258
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,300
in fact the case that someone external

259
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,240
puts software in your environment what's

260
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,649
to say that tomorrow they decide they

261
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,000
don't want to do mining and they want to

262
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:08,480
encrypt all of your corporate data this

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,260
is a way of determining quickly if you

264
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:18,139
have a potential threat of an outside

265
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:21,620
incursion so now I want to talk a little

266
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,850
bit about crypto fishing so fishing is

267
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,139
obviously been around for a long time

268
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:29,899
right we have normal vectors like email

269
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:32,660
we've seen a huge surge in search engine

270
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:35,660
ads so Google and other search providers

271
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,160
with AD poisoning and then with a lot of

272
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,480
different communication channels you

273
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:45,889
know slack telegram discord Twitter all

274
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,769
the normal all the normal ones and so

275
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:51,920
here is an example of some Google

276
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:55,310
advertisements they are for my Manero my

277
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,760
manure is a popular mineral wallet and

278
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:01,550
if you can see here underneath the Y on

279
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,399
the ad URL it's not quite right we see a

280
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:08,240
little dot and then on the second one

281
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,699
same we see a little mark above vo so

282
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,600
essentially what the malicious actors

283
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:16,310
are doing is they're using puny code to

284
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,079
simulates a domain name that looks

285
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,160
similar to the legitimate site and if

286
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,739
you aren't paying close enough attention

287
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,860
you put in your credentials and lose

288
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,079
your funds I'm so here here's actually

289
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,680
both of those sites they're currently no

290
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:35,209
longer live these are the exact copies

291
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:39,439
of the sites that's the second one

292
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,849
and just because you see it's HTTP it

293
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,910
really doesn't mean you're safe there

294
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,399
are a lot of providers these days that

295
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,079
offer a wild call wild card certificates

296
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,699
and so anything that's hosted on a

297
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,310
specific IP is blessed with the HTTPS

298
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:59,510
tag and that doesn't necessarily mean

299
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:03,199
you're safe so don't rely on HTTPS is as

300
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:06,050
a means of safety and then here's just a

301
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,010
another example of dokko another popular

302
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:13,010
search engine so to drive this point

303
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,810
home a little forward I'm going to talk

304
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:18,319
about how is it easy it is to make a

305
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,359
Google advertisement to get people

306
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,790
and this could be this doesn't

307
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,670
necessarily just apply to cryptocurrency

308
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,390
or crypto fishing it could be applied to

309
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:32,120
any fishing vector it's it's very very

310
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:35,660
effective so a couple things to note

311
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,260
about Google AdWords specifically you

312
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,719
have to basically the the redirect does

313
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,200
not happen in the ad the if you click on

314
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,440
an ad in Google it has the domain that's

315
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,050
registered here has to be part of the

316
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,770
landing page that the user ends up on so

317
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:58,250
you have to own it or at least reference

318
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:00,250
it and then the domain this displayed in

319
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,900
an ad cannot have a different site name

320
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,510
so essentially it you would have to

321
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,760
create a subdirectory or another page on

322
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,830
that site to do fishing so that's what

323
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,710
I've done here I've I've hidden it and I

324
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:18,530
put wallet slash I'm going to fish you

325
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,420
so in this use case the specific one I

326
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,339
would as a malicious actor have to

327
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,740
somehow infiltrate and get login

328
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,110
credentials for blockchain Don info

329
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,070
which would not be a very easy task by

330
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:34,420
any means but what I could do is I could

331
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,920
also set up a phishing campaign to get

332
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,620
someone who works at blockchain Don info

333
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,110
who operates their Google AdWords

334
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,850
account and and I hope if I can get

335
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,220
their login information for Google

336
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,760
AdWords that it may also be the same

337
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:55,490
credentials for their site and I can

338
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:59,090
then have the website was legitimate pay

339
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:01,820
for ads that are malicious and I can

340
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,190
have the redirect page to my phishing

341
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,530
site to get credentials living on

342
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,470
blockchain dot info as a as a

343
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,449
subdirectory so you you have to be

344
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,130
careful because malicious hackers will

345
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,589
take them at least two or three

346
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,420
different steps out as far as possible

347
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,490
phishing vectors in order to get

348
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,339
credentials and they're hoping that

349
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,089
you're using the same credentials for

350
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,089
multiple sites

351
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,580
here's an example of of the puny code

352
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,880
being used heavily and Google AdWords

353
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,889
and other ad sites here the is not quite

354
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,160
right and that's how it actually is

355
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,500
displayed when you look up the domain

356
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:48,810
but of course web browsers try to clean

357
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,710
up those types of things for users all

358
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,010
right so now I'm going to talk a little

359
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:57,540
bit about cryptocurrency exchanges and

360
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:01,800
in old coins so we discussed before

361
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,360
about phishing scams so here are some

362
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,840
advertisements for there but we also see

363
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,240
a lot of things happening on social

364
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,480
networks and communication platforms

365
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,230
this is something those mentioned by

366
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:20,970
Phillip at coinbase yesterday well it's

367
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:23,370
very easy to entice some people if you

368
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,190
send me point two etherium I'll give you

369
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,310
two aetherium just because me is by a

370
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,320
Nance I love you as a customer right

371
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,419
this doesn't work for the majority of

372
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,370
people but it still works for some and

373
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:40,220
this is still lucrative enough for them

374
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,219
to walk away with quite a bit of funds

375
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,169
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

376
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,780
finance quick raise of hands anybody

377
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,600
here used by Nance as a trading platform

378
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,310
all right we've got one all right

379
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,830
got a few in the audience good I love I

380
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,810
love finance as a trading platform it's

381
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:01,590
it's very simple to use easy to manage

382
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:03,960
they have a lot of security measures in

383
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:06,990
place to keep you from being fished or

384
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,240
sending funds to wallets that that are

385
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,860
not yours or you don't want them to be

386
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,680
sent to so right here we have an example

387
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,080
on the left of a malicious site and on

388
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,340
the right the legitimate site the only

389
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,939
difference being is that there happens

390
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,929
to be a V and the domain name on the one

391
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,850
on the left which is of course malicious

392
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,160
the infrastructure and and how the

393
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,020
malicious actor set this website was

394
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,240
quite good all of the stock information

395
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,580
updates at the exact same time if you

396
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,950
were to click on any of the links on the

397
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,620
fish

398
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,290
site that would lead you to logging in

399
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,330
within one or two clicks they would keep

400
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:50,560
you on the fishing site if you were to

401
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:53,379
look at wiki's or support or information

402
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,980
about contests they would Forge you to

403
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,600
the legitimate site and they did this so

404
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,470
they didn't have to replicate the full

405
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,149
infrastructure of the web site so let's

406
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,730
pretend that I was not paying attention

407
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,390
and I'm gonna log into this phishing

408
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:13,330
site so I go to the login page I put in

409
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,990
my email and my password I do a little

410
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:19,260
CAPTCHA and then you say but wait Austin

411
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,720
what about two-factor authentication

412
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:26,470
that'll probably save you here right no

413
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,680
not necessarily so this is what is known

414
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:33,010
as a to F a bypass or a

415
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,710
man-in-the-middle attack so I'm the

416
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,860
victim and I am on a phishing site one

417
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,140
of the ones we were just looking at I

418
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,379
him my credentials he Ford's that the

419
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,140
legitimate web site puts them in the

420
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,870
legitimate web site prompts for a

421
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,270
two-factor authentication code that is

422
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,100
sent to me and I don't know I still

423
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,350
don't know that I'm on the wrong side I

424
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,659
put that information into the phishing

425
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,060
site and then the malicious actor uses

426
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,520
that code in order to get into my

427
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:08,139
accounts and then normally after that

428
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,820
they Forge you to the actual website to

429
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,440
make it seem like there was just a login

430
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,210
glitch so you have no idea that you

431
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,150
actually just gave someone else access

432
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:20,140
to your accounts and most of the time

433
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:24,070
they actually do not immediately steal

434
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:27,070
your funds so if we look a little bit

435
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,010
more closely at div Nantz calm the

436
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,389
malicious domain that we were looking at

437
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,480
using a tool that we have called

438
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,010
investigate we can look at information

439
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,110
Whois information and some other

440
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,900
information as well that give us this

441
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,810
insight into is this actually legitimate

442
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,760
or not or who is doing this um so in

443
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,620
this case we see that the register name

444
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,700
is the Center for Ukrainian internet

445
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,959
names Finance does not operate and

446
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,240
Ukraine and

447
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,360
at the time and so this is very

448
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,380
suspicious the email registration black

449
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,570
13 at unseen is this is a this is a

450
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,740
email that prides itself on anonymity

451
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,960
and it's not what you would ever think

452
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,520
large exchange would use as their email

453
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,399
registration email so there are a lot of

454
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,529
red flags here okay and then what also

455
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:19,870
is interesting is the IP that this

456
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,880
domain is hosted on is not an IP that by

457
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,850
Nantz uses for hosting their

458
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,159
infrastructure so we're gonna dig a

459
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,689
little bit deeper into who is this black

460
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,640
thirteen unseen at unseen dot is what's

461
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,309
interesting is that you can see that

462
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,840
they're also interested in my wallet so

463
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,090
not only are they wanting to get

464
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,570
credentials for your exchange but they

465
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,039
also want to get credentials for online

466
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,668
wallets where you think your funds are

467
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,190
actually secure but maybe not if you end

468
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:53,980
up getting fished and down here you can

469
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,309
see a lot of their domains that they

470
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,070
have set up at varying stages trying to

471
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:04,299
pretend to be financed so some are live

472
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:08,408
some are prepping to to go live into to

473
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:10,210
fit for phishing sites I'm so so now

474
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:11,980
altcoins now now that we have all the

475
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,620
stuff about phishing this is where it

476
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:17,890
kind of gets really cool and very scary

477
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:21,309
so another tactic they use is involves

478
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,789
pump and dumps so it is the you you're

479
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:26,830
pumping the price of a coin and then you

480
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,600
sell all of your coins at the top and

481
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,908
you use a bunch of other people's funds

482
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,520
so what the malicious actors did was

483
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,279
they they fished a couple of hundred

484
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,960
exchange accounts and then they created

485
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,600
Trading API keys and then they didn't do

486
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,460
anything for like a month or two and

487
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,090
then they set up a bot to automatically

488
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,220
trade all of to basically liquidate all

489
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,350
of the coins that were in those wallets

490
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,470
into Bitcoin and then use that to

491
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,029
purchase via KOIN and the reason they

492
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,850
chose if I a coin was because the

493
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,710
liquidity of AI coin was only about 11

494
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,370
and a half Bitcoin so that means it was

495
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,679
very easy for

496
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,580
the actor to buy the whole order book

497
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,289
all asks all bids which essentially

498
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,649
would allow them to increase the value

499
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:14,450
of that coin by ten thousand percent so

500
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,370
if and what they did is they had a

501
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,070
couple accounts that they had their own

502
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:22,039
vine holdings in that they had procured

503
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,658
before and just lied in wait and we're

504
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,330
going to sell their own holdings at the

505
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:29,480
top and walk away with about thirty two

506
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:33,860
million dollars but unfortunately for

507
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:36,110
them it didn't happen the exchanges

508
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,090
noticed that ten thousand percent

509
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:42,619
increase in any asset is very unusual

510
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:45,619
and they basically blocked withdrawals

511
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:48,709
and deposits for that for those funds so

512
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:51,320
they didn't it impacted individuals and

513
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,480
the fact that they they lost a lot of

514
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,110
their asset value when their funds were

515
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,879
liquidated

516
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,508
but the malicious actor didn't walk away

517
00:24:55,879 --> 00:25:01,158
with any of the money but if exchanges

518
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:03,710
did not have some of those security

519
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,190
measures in place which is the case of a

520
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:09,710
lot of small exchanges they don't have

521
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,950
halting on trading for huge jumps and

522
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:16,580
asset prices they could have walked away

523
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,529
with a lot of money so now that I've

524
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,668
talked a lot about well crypt of

525
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:21,470
phishing encrypted Jack I wanna talk a

526
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:25,600
smidge more about how you can protect

527
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:29,869
yourself with with different tools so

528
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,689
DNS level identification of crypto

529
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:34,459
mining encrypt of jacking is very very

530
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,980
effective so looking through your DNS

531
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:41,690
query logs to see if things like coin

532
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:44,629
hive and other mining pools like XM are

533
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:47,539
minor pools XYZ is a very popular one

534
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:49,519
you can see if any of your machines and

535
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:52,158
your environments are querying these and

536
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,580
then you can know that okay well either

537
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,700
an employee went to a website that was

538
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,830
has a JavaScript exploit and mind a bit

539
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,299
of currency or maybe there's a piece of

540
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,509
software in my environment that is

541
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:08,059
mining that I need to look into for

542
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:09,619
cloud computing instances and this was

543
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:12,350
this was mentioned before in one of the

544
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,949
previous talks look for increases in

545
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:18,299
utilization of si

546
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:20,779
pee-yew for your aid AWS instances they

547
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:23,789
would normally only do 10 or 15%

548
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:25,260
increase and utilization so that when

549
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,639
you get your bill it doesn't seem it

550
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,429
seems higher than normal but it's not

551
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:31,379
too high and so that they want to

552
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:33,360
basically operate for as long in your

553
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,289
environment as they can without being

554
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,240
caught or identified and they are also

555
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:41,070
hoping that as long as the longer they

556
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,779
wait the value of that currency goes up

557
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:49,559
considerably so one of the models that

558
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:51,659
we use it briella is the co-occurrence

559
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:54,510
model and so it's kind of like guilty by

560
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:57,720
association so if we know that one

561
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,850
website is malicious and we look at the

562
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,010
the time that other sites were visited

563
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:06,029
basically fifteen seconds before or

564
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:08,070
after we can basically say okay that

565
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,049
seems a little suspicious if if all of

566
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,570
the users that are forwarding their dns

567
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:14,639
to our service are going to the exact

568
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,559
same domains within a certain time frame

569
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:20,428
love each other that's suspicious

570
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,350
and so what we can do is look at once

571
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,750
it's crossed the statistic threshold of

572
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,029
a number of people who are doing the

573
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,010
exact same behavior then we can say okay

574
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:32,610
this is very unusual we should look into

575
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:34,260
this and see if it's also malicious the

576
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,779
same thing can be done for legitimate

577
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,480
websites so I had mentioned coin hive

578
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:44,700
previously which is by the way a totally

579
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:47,039
legitimate we see misuse of coin hive a

580
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,659
lot of misuse of coin hive but it is in

581
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,429
fact a legitimate service it's just the

582
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,679
way that people are using in whether or

583
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:54,539
not they're notifying people that they

584
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,559
are using their resources to mine

585
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:00,750
currency so with coin hive we can see a

586
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,269
lot of co-occurrences with the websites

587
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,519
the behavior similar so we have a lot of

588
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:09,360
malicious domains that are associated

589
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,649
with phishing and browser redirects from

590
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,559
other legitimate sites we also see

591
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,510
domains that have JavaScript injections

592
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,549
that are running miners while people are

593
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,510
consuming content and then we've got

594
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:23,429
some other mining scripts where

595
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,629
essentially malicious actors are posing

596
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,350
to be coin hive

597
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,330
and getting you to install software or

598
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,669
put it on your website but hard code

599
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,439
their wallet address oh you basically

600
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,550
setup coin how I'm thinking you're going

601
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,320
to make some money but you're really

602
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:42,780
just sending it to somebody else so one

603
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,629
of the things that our team at Cisco

604
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,389
umbrella has worked on I wanna give a

605
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,730
shout out for Jeremiah O'Connor and arts

606
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,950
um two of my colleagues they developed

607
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:56,790
this classifier that's very effective in

608
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,890
identifying phishing traffic so we start

609
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,170
with domains that we've never seen

610
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,450
before we never resolved and when you

611
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,910
use Apache spark in order to come up

612
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:09,750
with the basis of this model so we'll do

613
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:12,570
an fqdn classification on the the page

614
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,330
will pull the source code of the first

615
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:18,649
page of the domain and then we'll start

616
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:21,210
looking at HTML content classification

617
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,800
and then we'll look to see okay now that

618
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,440
we know what this looks like and have a

619
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,270
general feeling is this being hosted on

620
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,330
infrastructure that we know is

621
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:33,660
legitimate is a really good IP is that a

622
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:36,510
good ASN or is it in some shady place in

623
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,400
Ukraine or elsewhere and then we can do

624
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,640
blocking and threat intelligence once

625
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,450
we've gone through that going a little

626
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,920
bit deeper we can see then we're

627
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,500
basically breaking this out into four

628
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,530
steps where we we have DNS queries

629
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,360
coming in we check to see if the

630
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,149
information of that site is listed on

631
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:01,350
something that we know and we trust and

632
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:04,050
then we will basically do a check on the

633
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,209
page to see okay is this page that we've

634
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,510
never seen before but looks similar to

635
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,970
something we have seen does it have a

636
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,640
box to input credentials or something

637
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:18,450
like that and then we will basically

638
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,230
create a tf-idf so this is basically

639
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:25,020
just NLP modeling's of natural language

640
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,970
processing and then we'll do some latent

641
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:31,230
semantic analysis and then we'll take

642
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:33,410
the cosine of the new site that we just

643
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:36,780
saw with the site that we know is

644
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,800
actually legitimate and then we'll

645
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,250
basically train its

646
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,389
in order to identify domains that are

647
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,420
good or bad

648
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,670
moving forward so here's a little bit

649
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:52,030
simpler version of it will we'll go look

650
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,710
at all of the exchanges that we know are

651
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,770
legitimate we'll download the code from

652
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,960
the site we'll create a score and then

653
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,960
we will whenever we see a new site that

654
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,150
seems similar we will create a corpus

655
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,890
document and we'll compare it and this

656
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,770
will allow us to determine if this is a

657
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:12,280
phishing site for a and exchange without

658
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:14,940
ever having to look at it so here's one

659
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,889
such example this is L coin based calm

660
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,560
and as a score of nine nine point four

661
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:23,080
and we can see here some other

662
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,679
suspicious things like Quinn basement

663
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:29,350
never have their email registration at a

664
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,030
hotmail account and that's they would

665
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,929
never do that so we know that this is

666
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,639
suspicious and here here is the live

667
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:39,460
site which at the time looked just like

668
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,750
coin basis website but it actually is in

669
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:47,980
fact malicious so one thing you have to

670
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:49,360
keep in mind is that they're the

671
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,790
criminal organizations that are behind

672
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,580
these types of attacks are using several

673
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,110
different revenue vectors they're not

674
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,870
just going to try to fix your

675
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,490
credentials they're also going to run

676
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,340
ransomware campaigns and they're also

677
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,190
going to try try to install crypto

678
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,230
mining software in your environment it's

679
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,380
very profitable it's pretty anonymous

680
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:14,910
and that's why they choose to do all of

681
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:19,210
these different vectors for making money

682
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:21,430
one such case that we we found and

683
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,980
highlighted a couple of months back was

684
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:27,340
just purely phishing crypto phishing of

685
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:31,960
wallets they actually in two months time

686
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:34,120
made almost two million dollars USD so

687
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,750
it's very lucrative for these malicious

688
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,389
actors and then going to the flip side

689
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,880
ransomware we see we see a lot of

690
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,980
ransomware still ransomware was a little

691
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,929
bit riskier of a business before when

692
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,110
you had to have infrastructure to

693
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:51,830
process credit card transactions but

694
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,469
with the the invention of

695
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,658
to currency much easier to make payments

696
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,990
more anonymous and you're less likely to

697
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:01,880
get caught and so I think

698
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,620
cryptocurrencies invention definitely

699
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,990
helped propel ransomware to be as much

700
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:11,268
of a problem as it as it was and in

701
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:12,740
still is so for for ransomware

702
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,990
infections normally you would get

703
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,490
infected right you'd be addicted and

704
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,830
then you would respond to the incident

705
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,929
you would restore from a backup if you

706
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,960
had it but if you didn't you would make

707
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:27,260
a decision whether or not okay I have to

708
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,090
have my data I should pay or no I don't

709
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,399
care I'm not going to pay I'll just lose

710
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,139
the data but let's say that you have to

711
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:34,489
get it you end up paying and then you

712
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:36,500
keep the rest of the cryptocurrencies

713
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:40,789
you have in storage just in case

714
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,529
something like that happens again so now

715
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:44,960
I'm gonna wrap it up with a couple of

716
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:45,679
final thoughts and then I'll open it up

717
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,919
for questioning

718
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:53,809
I'm so point number one we're really

719
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:56,000
witnessing a huge restructuring in the

720
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:59,299
criminal economy as far as

721
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,220
cryptocurrency is concerned this new

722
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:05,720
digital digital asset has really opened

723
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:10,310
up a lot of vectors for malicious actors

724
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,800
to spread more infrastructure and hit

725
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,259
more people luckily there are you know

726
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,510
any money any money laundering laws now

727
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:22,990
where if you move more than one Bitcoin

728
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:25,520
into fiat so yen USD euro you have to

729
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:28,908
give us a certain level of information

730
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,210
that will allow you to be tracked but

731
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:35,270
what criminals have figured out is that

732
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,010
they with these laws they have millions

733
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,320
of dollars in cryptocurrency that they

734
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,760
can't do anything with because it's very

735
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,589
hard to get into fiat without being

736
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,200
noticed so what they've been doing is

737
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:49,219
buying property and things like that to

738
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:54,279
try to get into an asset and then sell

739
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:57,770
that asset and then get Fiat second

740
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,300
individuals are encrypted tax or a much

741
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,640
software target

742
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,290
if I was a hacker I would much rather go

743
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,210
after someone who just started trading

744
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,270
cryptocurrencies even if they only have

745
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:11,720
fifteen thousand dollars invested then

746
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,880
going after a financial institution that

747
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,000
has a lot of security measures in the

748
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,369
been around for a long time so when

749
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,880
you're trading and if you decide to

750
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:24,950
trade in crypto assets really take your

751
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,660
own security to heart because you are

752
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:31,689
your own bank and you need to have your

753
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:34,220
own security measures third thought

754
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:36,140
there have been some recent shutdowns of

755
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:42,890
very popular exchanges that were being

756
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:46,069
used to basically dry in exchange

757
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:49,609
Bitcoin and other assets in a way that

758
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:52,130
kind of money laundered it and they've

759
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:54,529
decided to shift away from doing it this

760
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,910
way and focus on targeting the smaller

761
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,680
businesses that we talked about before

762
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:01,190
that maybe don't have such a great

763
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,669
security posture and then the last thing

764
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:07,580
that I want to leave with is protecting

765
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,349
your environment is hard right there are

766
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,359
always going to be new attacks that you

767
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,310
have to deal with but looking at your

768
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,589
DNS query logs is a really good first

769
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,920
step when you know that a specific

770
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:20,480
attack has to make a request a DNS

771
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,410
request so it's a very good way of

772
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,540
identifying if you might have a problem

773
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,730
but but don't just look for web-based

774
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:32,000
miners so don't just go look for coin I

775
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:35,630
of in your your logs right you also want

776
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,390
to look for software based miners like

777
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,530
honey miner that are running in your

778
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,540
environment because they can be a

779
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,280
possible indicator that someone

780
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,910
externally has installed software in

781
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,380
your environment so with that I'm going

782
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,379
to open it up for questions
