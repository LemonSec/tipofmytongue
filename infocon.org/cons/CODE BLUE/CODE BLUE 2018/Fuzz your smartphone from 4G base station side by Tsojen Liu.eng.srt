1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,018
like Hawaii occupy Mars watashi wa

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,120
holidays and this is only Japanese I can

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,700
speak so the recitation will be

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,419
presented by English okay good morning

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,500
everyone

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,200
and solan do you and I'd say my lady's

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,750
language is Chinese so my green ship is

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,549
pretty best if I say something wrong or

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,970
something that good please do not mind

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,179
my presentation okay this is my first

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:37,089
time too kibou and I'm happy to hear and

12
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:40,839
I'm here of all my team to share our

13
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:43,120
research research to everyone here okay

14
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:45,219
this is a today's agenda

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,269
the first we I will have a show

16
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:51,129
introduce about myself and talk about

17
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,710
eveything a basic knowledge of having

18
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:58,329
testing absolute I will list some

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,489
problem when we do the LT fasting we

20
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,979
find some problem and how we get over

21
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,920
this challenge at last I will share

22
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:08,980
issue we found by our fasting and I also

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,730
prepare a video demo and response from

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,270
Koh Chang ok so let me do this much

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,640
myself first

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,960
I come from Taiwan and my Chinese name

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,780
is the old Turin I know Chinese is very

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,169
hard to pronounce but you can just call

29
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:33,150
me Daniel it is much easier to to

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,800
remember and to say and is I have been

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,520
experienced on security testing and

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,009
found almost security at 2014 ok our

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,979
security has a I saw 70 or 20 file a

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,770
battery and our laboratory doing the

35
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:52,180
cybersecurity assessment service and our

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:55,570
target focus on IOT and ICS SCADA

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,560
and automotive now I in charge of all

38
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:02,139
these less testing laboratory ok our

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,580
team sings almost curative before almost

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,818
curity since 2012 we stole out he and in

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,359
various and testing since now more than

42
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:15,100
200 device and product we already test I

43
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:18,330
think maybe 300

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,160
we'll be test by this year okay

45
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,250
leastwise include access points IP

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,850
camera Smart TV smartphone and it seemed

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:31,000
like related to to IOT okay so we

48
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,799
provide a testing service so we use a

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,800
vulnerability scanning tool to scan

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,570
known vulnerability and we also use

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:43,600
protocol filing tool to help to try to

52
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:48,340
find something implement a row by layer

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,640
network service like HTTP SSL TLS

54
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,730
SSH something like that okay the

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,959
supporting spanky the customer want to

56
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,390
do more like just not satisfied with

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,420
normal beauty so we use the volume test

58
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,450
to find something unknown and he'll plan

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,950
to fix the issues and what is false

60
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:14,049
testing I was falling simple in speaking

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,530
you just send something wrong something

62
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:21,070
mail phone just like a very long string

63
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,890
a very big value and something mail

64
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:27,609
phone to a talking and we just need to

65
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,070
monitor the target response does in

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,860
response lays no response from the

67
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,470
target it means ma is this a

68
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,560
vulnerability so we can do that more

69
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:43,150
analyzed to make sure the target is

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,780
vulnerable okay so we have a simple

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:49,030
process about a proto fuzzing and in

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,980
this process I will also let you know

73
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:57,640
the most important and some problem we

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:01,390
face when we do the LTE fuzzing okay I

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:05,410
know maybe we're all issues family with

76
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,690
this pray process the first of the first

77
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,650
thing to do the protocol fuzzing is

78
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:15,100
build building the environment because

79
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:20,858
if you like 2000 on HTTP protocol you

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:23,169
need HTTP server if you like to do doing

81
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,590
fuzzing and Buddhist you have near boot

82
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,080
whose products also you we want to fast

83
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,888
smartphone you also need

84
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,568
Alti environment to do the we

85
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,710
saw the environment we cannot do the

86
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:41,199
protocol static so you so this is why we

87
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:45,340
tried to build a LT environment and do a

88
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,250
thousand tests on a smartphone okay the

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,729
next one once we have the environment

90
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,219
then we can capture the packet from our

91
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:56,650
environment especially for those

92
00:04:54,219 --> 00:05:00,310
proprietary protocol this is the only

93
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:02,948
way to gather data and to the get

94
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,650
together data for another standard

95
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:08,740
protocol you can capture the packet from

96
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,758
our environment or you can find more

97
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,819
information from FC document I said well

98
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,370
okay so this is I have an example for

99
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:22,300
everybody this is a very easy easy in

100
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:26,199
pimple HTTP request and send HTTP POST

101
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:30,659
data to CGI bin processed at CGI and

102
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:36,099
they also this secret request include

103
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:40,479
include request line and haters and

104
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:45,310
message body okay so we can in this step

105
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,219
I will use the HTTP POST data to this

106
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,379
crowd to generate the file in pattern

107
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:55,990
there's just an easy way and a concept

108
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:58,330
ok in we would like to generate the fast

109
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,120
data actually there are two major

110
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,539
methodology to to generate the data the

111
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,080
first one is the mutation base you don't

112
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:11,469
need any require no knowledge required

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,068
you just need to be flipping on your

114
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:18,009
data you capture and the other one is

115
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:20,529
the generation base okay for the

116
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,379
generation base you have to know the

117
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:26,860
lease protocol so you have to build a

118
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:29,440
data model to know how many fields how

119
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,560
kind of data should be used in this

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,979
protocol so you have build a data model

121
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,080
and define a template for each in this

122
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,690
template you have to define which fields

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,639
you want to do the fuzzing and use your

124
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:47,319
father to generate a lot of

125
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,900
data okay so our LT environment in our

126
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:54,939
lease project LT fuzzing we use a

127
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,770
generation based to generate the 13 data

128
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,979
a lot of thousand data

129
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,400
okay so totally damp oh okay this is uh

130
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:07,150
I just mentioned before HTTP POST to

131
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,270
cgi-bin process CGI and let me see the

132
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:14,198
first farting Peter what we can do okay

133
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,710
you see in this except HTTP header we

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:22,779
just change its name to something an

135
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:26,020
ASCII character okay and also how we can

136
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:29,849
do we also can change you the separate

137
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,740
of the hater name and its value so we

138
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:35,860
separate this should be the Colin but I

139
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,740
change to another non ASCII character so

140
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:43,870
you can use your image nation to

141
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,939
generate your following data not only FF

142
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,029
you can use anything you want and you

143
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:51,550
see you can do the testing okay the less

144
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:54,610
example is a real case that we met

145
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,629
before mixing maybe three or four years

146
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:01,750
before we do the router

147
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:05,379
so whole lotta heads okay this is

148
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:08,789
a very introducing some router a web

149
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:11,379
interface they will allocate memory vise

150
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:14,878
according to your countenance

151
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:17,949
so some one time we just changed the

152
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:21,699
counter lens to a very very big value

153
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:24,400
and some some idiot the router will try

154
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:29,229
to unlock it such big memory size in

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:32,439
their device and then their product just

156
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,229
crash so you can you can change you can

157
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,510
Inc you if you want to for some data you

158
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,789
can change your hider name you can

159
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,000
change your date our here okay you can

160
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,579
or just change the hydroseparator okay

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,160
you can just use your imagination to

162
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:51,939
generate as much as possible for the

163
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:56,050
data and do the testing I'll say even we

164
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,740
just even regenerator 1 million or

165
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:04,180
or more sodding data and next thing we

166
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:07,720
will try to send this data to our target

167
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,660
I think the same data is the most easy

168
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,330
way in the filing process you just need

169
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,930
to write a Python scripts use maybe your

170
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,900
request or a sake and send the data you

171
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:23,829
generate you can generate the data and

172
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,410
sift into the file and real file by

173
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,350
Europe Isis creed and just sent to the

174
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,160
target and check the response by another

175
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:36,030
spice and code or you can use the camel

176
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,709
I just to the egg hole and you can use a

177
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,800
base64 to encode Europe a low and

178
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,620
central target by system and life just

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,990
want to come in you can if you cannot

180
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,420
you don't know how to run a Python you

181
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,230
can use the command line use the best

182
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:56,020
bash script to do the following thing

183
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:59,020
okay so after we send a date house so

184
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,140
next one next steps we need to monitor

185
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,770
monitor our target to check response

186
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:10,319
when they receive our mail from data

187
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:13,000
okay actually they are two kind of

188
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,730
Mythology to monitor a talkie

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,370
the first one is remote mostly the

190
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,730
remote monitor is used by cross phone

191
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,670
maybe sometimes you use the Windows to

192
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,880
send a data but your target may be it's

193
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,640
a very system you cannot install the

194
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,250
engine on this device so you have to use

195
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,300
the remote monitor something you can

196
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,270
just ping the tog II USM MPC slug SSH or

197
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,569
anything you can imagination or some

198
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:46,420
pictur provider vendor okay if you were

199
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,790
targeted install on your Linux server or

200
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,560
Windows Server so you can use your local

201
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:57,040
monitor to monitor the process it's not

202
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:00,459
the process crashed after you have to

203
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,760
receive your following data maybe it

204
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,820
means is this some vulnerability so in

205
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,770
local monitor you can use the process

206
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,660
you can check the process server ease

207
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,079
event

208
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:16,290
look over use Europe your engine to do

209
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,240
to do that okay you once we find your

210
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,180
monitor find something wrong you can use

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,720
an ally you can try to analyze reboot us

212
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,589
why the product why the demon will

213
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,870
crashed by Europe by your mail phone

214
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,240
packet sometimes just only denial

215
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,290
service attack but sometimes it's over

216
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,830
protects you can try to more analyze to

217
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,740
do export and their steps just rise

218
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,440
clear to try to exploit the

219
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,410
vulnerability you found ok

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,140
there look really a lot of love famous

221
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,900
falling - oh like the synopsis and

222
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,150
beyond security also half they are

223
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,180
falling - of course we also have our

224
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,689
falling - so in the process I just

225
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,469
mentioned so we have the three major

226
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:10,640
challenge when we do we try to do the

227
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:13,200
LTE fuzzing ok I say the first one is

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,580
environment because I just mentioned

229
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,580
before HTTP the product falling is easy

230
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:24,120
because everybody can download and

231
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:28,380
establish Oh HTTP server or DNS server

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,630
it's not a very hard hard hard jobs but

233
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,110
if you like to build some radiofrequency

234
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:37,290
vironment it is a little bit harder than

235
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,910
do the common protocol fuzzing for

236
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,730
example ok

237
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:46,319
the Wi-Fi is the web we be able to use

238
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,990
such a very common use in IOT device so

239
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,930
already a lot of open source and the

240
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,350
tools and equipment you can buy and

241
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,219
maybe Amazon or on website you can buy

242
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,990
the related equipment to do

243
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:06,030
radiofrequency testing for the booties

244
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:11,280
for the Wi-Fi but what LTE is a cellular

245
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:14,699
network ok it is a less information to

246
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,360
know how we build a six-pack station 6

247
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,640
station yourself once you if you have to

248
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,430
build station then you can capture the

249
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:28,050
data in generator the data to

250
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:33,209
to a farthing test and another thing LTE

251
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:35,939
is a complicated complete is complicated

252
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,089
so you have to find which requests in

253
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,510
which channel we can used for fuzzy not

254
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:45,029
each request now each function and

255
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:48,480
channel could be used for flooding and

256
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:51,990
lesson one how we monitor the cell phone

257
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,990
the cell phone is menu pro by by the

258
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,230
manufacturer we can how we use how we

259
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:02,520
monitor what health LT signal received

260
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:07,350
by us mas phone this is the another

261
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,540
major challenge in our in our testing so

262
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,410
how we to do the mountain turn by remote

263
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:18,180
or by local okay so next one I will

264
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:19,050
introduce how we to how we get over this

265
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,349
challenge

266
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:25,380
okay the first one and the building

267
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,410
testing environment so why we do this

268
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,230
kind of do this research because one day

269
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,779
the vintage El Nino picture say hey

270
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,980
Daniel we have a new LTE product but

271
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:41,880
they only have a local Wi-Fi less iron

272
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,820
and LTE site did you have a LT in

273
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,730
equipment the LT base station can

274
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,970
emulate or simulates the LT environment

275
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,430
I said actually no we don't have a

276
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,029
healthy environment right now but I

277
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,680
think it's now the biggest problem so we

278
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,500
think ok we just be the proper

279
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,760
environment and then we can do something

280
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:08,880
more like fuzzing ok so we take a little

281
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,310
time to research LTE network

282
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,279
architecture so this is a very important

283
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,630
slide so first one you have to know that

284
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:22,560
user equipment like user equipment means

285
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:25,829
any device any product which can insert

286
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,599
a sync are like your smartphone like

287
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:33,719
your Wi-Fi egg your tablet your IP its

288
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,900
own belong to use the equipment so you

289
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,200
when you use equipment inserting car it

290
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,230
will

291
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,019
coming to the inner be a means of base

292
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,480
station and by station well transfer

293
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,170
transferred rate had to the EPC of

294
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,529
beckon sign and put your Priya date

295
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:57,569
heart transfer your data to the Internet

296
00:15:52,529 --> 00:16:00,660
so this is also my phone so if you'd

297
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:04,829
like to build healthy environment you

298
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:08,010
have to build in OB and et PC under

299
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:11,219
environment so I think it is not a big

300
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,399
problem but I just google and find

301
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,930
something wow it's a really really big

302
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:23,010
problem you can see lizard

303
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:26,880
LT base station simulator it cost 50

304
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:29,339
million yen so here I think not every

305
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,459
each company have our budget to buy this

306
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,649
such expensive device ok

307
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:38,489
and also one thing this kind of the

308
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:42,029
product used for interoperability is not

309
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:44,790
useful fuzzing we cannot modify any

310
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:49,320
anything for this in this device in this

311
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:51,810
product in this equipment so if we want

312
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,800
to do LTE we can build a fake station

313
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:58,979
but if we want to do the fuzzing for LTE

314
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,579
we have to do it myself

315
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,520
our selves so we just release some

316
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:11,010
equipment software sigh and how with you

317
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:14,609
you need to use to build LT environment

318
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:16,890
so we can check the UE the LTV from

319
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:20,418
icing everybody has a smartphone here so

320
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:23,880
this is the most easy thing it equipped

321
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:28,890
device we can get and you have no need a

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:32,250
passing car because if we build in OB

323
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,590
ourselves the information let's think

324
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,370
how will connect to your in OB so you

325
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:41,070
have to put the data pool information

326
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:44,639
into your basing car so we will use some

327
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,189
software to writing information to your

328
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,950
blessing car and use of character and

329
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,180
software to write let's sink to write

330
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:56,370
data into your

331
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:00,120
car info in OB we use a SDR so for a

332
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:04,979
software-defined radio to simulate a

333
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:09,360
radio frequency the you use a USRP b210

334
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:15,120
and an antenna to to make a small fake

335
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,760
station and for how we monitor loss cell

336
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,000
phone what kind of LTE signal is a

337
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,090
receive we use a cue at the end provide

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,250
by Kong you can help you connect to your

339
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:30,330
cell phone and let you know what kind of

340
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:35,010
data receive by your cell phone and to

341
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:38,040
simulate the email B we use the open

342
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,800
source code open air interface so you

343
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:45,960
can use the open air interface in the

344
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:49,350
USRP to build into build based fixed

345
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,440
station and for if you see you just just

346
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:56,100
need a V an imagination okay so this

347
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,100
screenshot of our testing environment so

348
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,219
sorry if about Chinese warmly okay so

349
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,760
this in the list carrier name is

350
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,070
simulated by us by our security and the

351
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,120
timer mobile Firestone junghwa people

352
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:14,879
least the real carrier in taiwan so you

353
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,330
can see my our cell phone can find our

354
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,150
network and we just click and coming to

355
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,820
you can connect to our FX station you

356
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:31,710
also can find the information and status

357
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:34,710
on your email be screenshots okay so if

358
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,300
you were yourself from connect to our FX

359
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,140
station and you can connect to the

360
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:42,480
internet so it means you LT environment

361
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,810
is ready so we can move to the next

362
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:51,630
steps to analyze LT architecture and

363
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:56,460
find a way to do the fuzzing okay okay

364
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:59,550
so open air interface the LT you have

365
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,720
like many different channel IPCC sec CH

366
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:05,428
and physical and Transpo logic oh and a

367
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,650
different interval

368
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:11,520
so actually okay you know you can

369
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:14,400
generate data for each channel each sub

370
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,150
channel you want is fine but the class

371
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,809
DM we got only support to monitor some

372
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:24,660
channels so if we want to fly to do a

373
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,850
fuzzing we only can generate the data

374
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,070
for this channel because we can monitor

375
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:36,659
for camp data received by your cell

376
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:40,139
phone so the next next step is generator

377
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,660
the following data so this open your

378
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,450
operator interface architecture so you

379
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,760
can see its architectures and this is a

380
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:55,380
you know be and it is

381
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:58,770
EPC a most most function will be located

382
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,549
in the you know BRR C and Mme

383
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:06,330
application so we have to focus on this

384
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:09,870
application and she has to check what

385
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:13,199
kind of request could be fast and could

386
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:16,860
be monitored so we take a lot of time to

387
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:21,450
check and to we have always and list on

388
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:25,260
this list request channel subchannel and

389
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:29,160
request is can be fast and also can be

390
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:33,590
marked her by qfd m okay so we tickle

391
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,419
time try to find which each request and

392
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:39,449
to check the open source and source code

393
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:43,290
and you can find a different the

394
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:47,040
different functional process pc CH 2 DC

395
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:49,139
CH in different file name and different

396
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,139
function then so we take a lot of time

397
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,980
to to check the function which function

398
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:58,620
and in which file of the source code so

399
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,770
we just we frame we find the source code

400
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:06,389
the next steps we can just go rewrite

401
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:09,629
the source code and you we pull our we

402
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:12,120
generate our passing data first then we

403
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:16,860
you which rewrite the source code to

404
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,870
read our passing data file and just send

405
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,050
the data to a target

406
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,270
okay so we can start our testing okay

407
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:28,230
this is our thousand test basic

408
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:32,790
architecture so you can see we have a

409
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:36,000
lot device here and connect to monitor

410
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:38,580
by Christian use a USB and we also

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,490
prepare a sink our lab Lexington we have

412
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:46,439
to rise some single information like

413
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:49,370
iccid an MC MC MC I socialize this

414
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,960
information and this information are

415
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:56,280
according to your inner being

416
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:59,240
information so we have to write the same

417
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:05,070
time and inserting to your smartphone

418
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:09,120
and for us and for a fix station we use

419
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:12,178
AES RPE to connect to your host OS and

420
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,570
we install Ubuntu on the host OS and

421
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:20,130
running open-air interface on host OS

422
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:23,669
and for et Cie we use of VMware image to

423
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:26,880
simulate the image EPC environment and

424
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:30,360
we also rewrite the open air interface

425
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,350
and EPC we generated a file in data and

426
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:37,639
ask the open air interface an EPC to

427
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:41,399
read the fuzzing patent we generate and

428
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:45,059
read the volume pattern and send to the

429
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:52,050
target and monitor the device status in

430
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:55,320
response ok this is equipment we do a

431
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:58,500
testing which is LG Google this as fine

432
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,200
and the only thing you have to pay

433
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,340
attention is the processor this

434
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:09,720
processor is made by the corn as a

435
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:13,439
hungry okay-y process because LTE signal

436
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,650
will processed by modern and modern are

437
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,410
integrated into Europe processor ok and

438
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,830
let me see the real environment that you

439
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:26,580
can see is a not such a difficult thing

440
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:30,389
to do that only one computer and we can

441
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,668
do the EPC and wrong in OB on host OS

442
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,779
and connect us RP

443
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:39,450
USB to simulator love thick station and

444
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:44,460
can link to your use equipment to

445
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:49,559
monitor by our QX t n ok so in our way

446
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,869
we just rewrite our Cisco and s opening

447
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,889
your interface to read a file in data

448
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:59,070
from the file and you can check the qst

449
00:24:55,889 --> 00:25:01,139
and log so you can check a welcome of

450
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,649
message you type received by your

451
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:08,668
smartphone and what i'm a pecky lens and

452
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:11,129
the payload using to a target so we can

453
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:11,669
use the christian log to check what kind

454
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:13,830
of data

455
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:17,700
what kind of payload received by a

456
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:20,460
smartphone what kind of message can make

457
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:26,539
your device no response

458
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:31,080
ok ok they may see our Father INRI so so

459
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:34,340
when your device connect to our back

460
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:37,859
station if your device your smartphone

461
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,309
users tokens from a hungry ok

462
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:42,859
he may be vulnerable when they win the

463
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:46,489
smartphone receives a message

464
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:50,369
authentication makes each code 0 7

465
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:54,480
establish the row 7 5 4 this is useful

466
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:56,850
or authentication reject so you can just

467
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,440
send a single practical authentication

468
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:06,418
reject then you can make your smartphone

469
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,739
to emergency call only even you switch

470
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,989
ON switch off to airplane mode still

471
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:15,769
emergency call only the only way to back

472
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:18,389
to normal for your smartphone is

473
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:20,129
reconnect to a name reboot your

474
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:23,639
smartphone letting us with your

475
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:28,859
smartphone will be beer back to normal

476
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:32,729
ok so we have the video demo because

477
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:36,330
it's very hard to do a real demo really

478
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:39,600
encrypting demo he here

479
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:44,158
ok so they has a three part in this

480
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,620
video ok this is the first part ok so

481
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:51,330
this you can see now it's a

482
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:55,408
oh I'll play along and we switch off it

483
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:59,428
connect to our base station so you can

484
00:26:55,409 --> 00:27:04,140
see the lt's you know can connect to 2-0

485
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:06,870
a 93 it's our fixed station so now we

486
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,929
can make sure the base station is work

487
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:12,719
okay look lt's your smartphone can

488
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,320
coming to effect station okay so we

489
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,730
switch to airplane mode again okay so

490
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,520
part two

491
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,480
so we reboot affect station and try to

492
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,460
send a farthing date how we found the

493
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,450
authentication message start with zero

494
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:35,669
seven five four okay we just check the

495
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:45,919
log and to act a rung in OB and e TP

496
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:49,500
server again just a little time to do it

497
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,880
okay so the EPC and you know be are

498
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,760
ready so let's paris we will check with

499
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,820
now we will switch off the apron and all

500
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:04,590
and let the mobile phone connect to the

501
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,689
sex station okay so you can see the

502
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:11,610
different response

503
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:16,110
it changed - it means emergency call

504
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:18,719
only okay so we just switch over palermo

505
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:22,080
and connect to our fax station in

506
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,260
response emergency call only and even

507
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,799
you switch on memo and switch up again

508
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,669
east still also tell you emergency call

509
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,289
only okay so the only way to back to

510
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,399
normal you have to reboot your device

511
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:43,890
but reboot should take a long time so

512
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:48,600
let get it faster to be odd okay we put

513
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:52,230
advise and we switch over airplane mode

514
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:56,158
again okay you can it can come reconnect

515
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:59,460
to the internet again so in our fuzzing

516
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,570
we find out the single peg we can do the

517
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,630
flooding and

518
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:07,980
so one pick you make your cell phone

519
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:11,519
changing only emergency call only so it

520
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:15,419
will also sink if I am the tech chure

521
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:19,500
how can I use is one Liberty and what is

522
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:23,220
texting scenario okay so we can image

523
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:27,769
that lis cell phone coming to real Ltd

524
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:32,220
base station like NTT DoCoMo and popular

525
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:35,730
carrier in Japan so we can sing if we

526
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,639
locate in the small area small ruin just

527
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,789
like a list written if our base station

528
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:45,899
is much powerful their signal is

529
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:48,740
powerful than real carrier environment

530
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:55,080
the signal is much powerful so maybe

531
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:58,440
your your device will connect to my LT

532
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,840
station then I just send the signal

533
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:05,759
indication message to the device a

534
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:08,370
device will emergency only even like go

535
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:12,090
to the real go back to a real LT

536
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:14,399
environment maybe steal imagine sink

537
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,970
only they have to reboot layers Marta

538
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,189
phone okay we test not only Google

539
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:25,019
letters five also test for the sony

540
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:27,240
xperia z3 pass Asus zenfone 3 and Asus

541
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:30,029
zenfone 2 for you can see the different

542
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,940
local calm process with Ted and we

543
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:38,759
follow coking as 800 and coke Hong sy

544
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,940
810 also helpful of San vulnerability

545
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:47,179
just receive the authentication reaches

546
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:50,309
message the device will turn into

547
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:53,730
connect/disconnect emergency co only

548
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:57,480
okay we also lease this device because

549
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:00,929
they all use snap dragon a hungry so it

550
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:05,840
means maybe this device are also

551
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:10,309
vulnerable for least also vulnerable and

552
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:14,309
all this device I'll owe you Snapdragon

553
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:17,879
810 ok it means yes it may

554
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:21,840
vulnerable we did not test each device

555
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:23,789
because we are a snooze the company we

556
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,629
don't have too much money to buy a

557
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:31,529
cellphone to to do the testing so but we

558
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:34,199
still report this issue to cocon so we

559
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:37,619
found this issue and less December and

560
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,259
we send a mail to coketown and and they

561
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,269
say oh the thing is not the

562
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:45,690
vulnerability are we OH

563
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:48,029
every time we send up the information to

564
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,789
a vendor different mental I always say

565
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:53,279
it's not a vulnerability ok we just

566
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:58,200
expand how we do a test and they have a

567
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:01,710
more researched and analyzed roukoz ok

568
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:06,539
let's say ok coconut oil some older more

569
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:10,589
cocoa more then it really heavily spark

570
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:14,369
but lately think it's already big fix in

571
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:19,229
the new more than maybe a 30 a 30 or a

572
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:22,709
50 in the neural processor they already

573
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:26,729
they also they say they also release the

574
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:30,629
page about this issue to to another

575
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:34,469
manufacturer but not every manufacturer

576
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:38,580
will install a patch so if your if your

577
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:41,249
vendor euro yen do not release LePage or

578
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,070
update your smartphone your maybe your

579
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:47,879
smartphone will be vulnerability by this

580
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:51,809
issue okay so still some pros still some

581
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:56,369
products vulnerable for this issue ok so

582
00:32:51,809 --> 00:33:00,979
the co can also give real explanation

583
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:02,580
and why the single packet will cost

584
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,659
device only

585
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:10,549
imagistic oh only they say in CG PP

586
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:13,229
specification they say the authentic

587
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:16,979
authentication message should be do

588
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:20,789
integration check okay so in Apple in

589
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:25,409
our case we can send anything just start

590
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:27,239
with 0 7 5 4 then rest payload is not

591
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,840
important you can put any data pull

592
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,940
anything

593
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,459
so because they do not do the

594
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:36,240
integration check they just see the zero

595
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,060
seven five four okay he will accept

596
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,610
receive and proceed and manual device

597
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:47,429
cannot connect to a network but in 3gpp

598
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:49,830
specification so you use equipment your

599
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,620
smart phone your tablet your wife I

600
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:56,600
guess you discard this kind of message

601
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:59,909
the message failed to pass the

602
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,439
integration checks okay so the

603
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,080
quarantine are combined with the

604
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,750
specimen check and with we saw we found

605
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,530
this kind of issue and refer to to the

606
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,139
colqhoun

607
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:16,380
okay so this is our research we so we

608
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,509
use effect station to rewrite open

609
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,090
source and build effect station ourself

610
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,910
to do the following test on smartphone

611
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:26,240
ok we also elect to special thanks

612
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:29,069
follows hi won national Elon University

613
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,799
they also give us a lot of suggestion

614
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:35,550
and recommendation how to build a

615
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,940
healthy environment okay so I hope

616
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:41,070
