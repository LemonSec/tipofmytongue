1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,519
thank you very much for the invitation

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,650
Thank You Patrick and others for

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,219
organizing this this is my second time

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:19,189
in Japan the last time was 17 years ago

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,669
many things have changed very glad to be

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:23,749
back

7
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:26,229
I quickly tell you what I do I run

8
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:30,229
several cybersecurity

9
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:32,390
organizations and projects one is the

10
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:35,390
digital hub cybersecurity which is

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,860
located in damage that I'm managing

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,260
director we coordinate all

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,410
commercialization of cyber security

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,160
technology the other one is you might

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,099
know that how Nova society's Institute

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,099
for cyber security the found of asset

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:59,230
then I'm part of --crisp --crisp is the

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:03,170
largest applied cyber security research

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:07,340
cluster in Europe now we have more than

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:10,850
500 scientists focusing on cyber

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,179
security and I'm also part of ESP car

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,818
which is focused more on geo strategic

23
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:20,210
studies in this context I also advise

24
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:24,609
the German Department of Defense on

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:29,749
cyber security issues so shortly about

26
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:34,089
Darmstadt why is cyber security located

27
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:37,839
in Darmstadt which is south of frankfurt

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:41,929
as you see Germany is very decentralized

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,079
so we have at least 12 technology

30
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:48,439
clusters for example in cows who we have

31
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,199
artificial intelligence in Munich we

32
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,109
have mobility which makes sense if

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,979
you've ever been to Munich with BMW and

34
00:01:54,109 --> 00:02:01,279
all the car industry and I run the cyber

35
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:04,759
security stuff in Darmstadt which a lot

36
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:09,258
of people don't know why is damaged at

37
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:12,530
the epicentre in Germany for

38
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:16,299
cybersecurity the reason is that after

39
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:19,880
Second World War

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,760
Germany needed a new center for all

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:27,980
telecommunications technology and that

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:32,420
was established in 1949 in Darmstadt two

43
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:36,649
years later the Allied forces mostly the

44
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:41,600
US and the predecessor of what today is

45
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:46,730
the NSA they created the first crypto

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:50,900
center in Darmstadt in a large military

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:55,459
facility called dagger complex which was

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,770
then crucial for all crypto activities

49
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,850
during the cold war with the Soviet

50
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:04,450
Union and most important the so-called

51
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:08,170
the white salvation sent from d'art set

52
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,910
which was the first supercomputer in

53
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:15,829
Germany and the picture you see is the

54
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:20,030
actual IBM mainframe and a lot of people

55
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:25,510
my colleagues at my Institute formerly

56
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:30,130
were working for IBM so this is how our

57
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:34,399
building looks today we focus on mostly

58
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:38,930
anything anything in cybersecurity we do

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,370
it our largest department I think with

60
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,720
60 people now is focused on automotive

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:50,720
systems security we have a large

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,330
Department for network security because

63
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,290
we work closely together with Israel we

64
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:01,310
have an office in Tel Aviv and we have

65
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:04,190
quite a few Israeli colleagues that work

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,200
with me in this building we do IT

67
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,530
forensics we do cyber threat

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:15,109
intelligence and I'm mostly focused on

69
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,209
cyber strategy and deterrence which is

70
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,980
what I want to talk about with you today

71
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:24,969
I think in the program it actually says

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:29,050
detergents but it is deterrence

73
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:34,150
the important differentiation why do i

74
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:37,920
focus on cyber deterrence because a long

75
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:42,039
time ago I had a classic military

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,670
background I served for United Nations

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,790
in Sierra Leone for the Department of

78
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:53,140
peacekeeping operations that was in 1999

79
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:56,650
in the war and then in Kosovo so that

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:59,289
was a for cyber and then I was inside in

81
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,150
technology for a long time and now

82
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:05,920
through cyber security I'm bringing

83
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,650
these two worlds together so why are we

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,100
talking today about cyber deterrence I'm

85
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:17,830
curious who of you has ever heard about

86
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,160
cyber deterrence the Europeans okay got

87
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,599
it

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:30,460
one great so as I see it's a new concept

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:36,040
here in Japan it is becoming a very

90
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:39,340
important concept in Europe it has been

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,919
a very important concept in the US and

92
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,359
Israel for a long time and now it is

93
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:51,130
spreading the word deterrence most of us

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,680
know it from nuclear deterrence but in

95
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,190
the context of cyber it means something

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,400
different so let's first talk about the

97
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,440
difference between cyber defense which

98
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,530
is what most of you have been talking

99
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,830
about during this conference and

100
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:12,640
deterrence so cyber defence is focused

101
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,240
on wakening the effects of a cyber

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,919
attack this is what many of you do on a

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,890
daily basis this is your business

104
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:27,849
cyber strategy and deterrence something

105
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:32,500
different it tries to manipulate the

106
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:36,240
behavior of your cyber opponent so that

107
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:40,819
the attack does not happen

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:44,280
and in contrast to nuclear deterrence

109
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:48,120
where our goal was that there is no

110
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:54,150
attack at all because any nuclear attack

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:57,060
would be devastating in cyber we have a

112
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,830
different goal the goal is not absolute

113
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,660
deterrence but the goal is to minimize

114
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,710
the number to reduce the number of

115
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,470
attacks so that's an important

116
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:13,560
conceptual difference between nuclear

117
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,680
deterrence and cyber deterrence that's

118
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:21,530
why some of my colleagues in the US have

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:26,250
started to call this whole complex of

120
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:30,059
strategizing cyber coercion or cyber

121
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,930
strategy but I'm using the term

122
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,229
deterrence

123
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:40,860
because it is a little clearer in the

124
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:43,979
literature so why is this important why

125
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,320
why is everyone talking at least within

126
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:51,770
NATO frames about deterrence let's see

127
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:55,889
in our industry in cybersecurity

128
00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:00,359
there are five generations of products

129
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:03,750
that we sold or are still selling to

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:08,750
customers the first generation started

131
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:12,240
in the late 1980s you all know it

132
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:16,860
anti-virus technology or as we call it

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,580
snake oil because it's as we know not a

134
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:26,190
real technology it was more something to

135
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:29,789
sell then there was the second

136
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:34,578
generation in the 1990s the firewall

137
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:38,640
technology then third generation

138
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:41,640
application protection technology early

139
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,720
2000s a lot of corporate clients are

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,180
still in generation 3 in terms of what

141
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,149
they buy for their corporations

142
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:58,149
generation four sandboxing anti bought

143
00:08:53,149 --> 00:09:00,980
technologies start around 2010 and now

144
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:04,730
something interesting is happening we

145
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:09,370
are focusing on chip level prevention

146
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:12,199
technology which is not easy to do and

147
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,279
why is this suddenly so important to go

148
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:19,399
so deep in the Aussie layer to really

149
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,800
care about chip level prevention as for

150
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,430
example Apple is doing it well one of

151
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,769
the reasons is that we are facing

152
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:32,479
government sponsored large-scale

153
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:36,199
multi-vector attacks nowadays and what

154
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:42,250
complicates this is that in the past

155
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:45,680
these attacks were exclusively within

156
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:51,730
the range of the capabilities of

157
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:55,758
governments mostly the US and others but

158
00:09:51,730 --> 00:10:01,790
know how how to do these attacks has

159
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:05,319
proliferated and now non-state actors or

160
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:10,759
even small states and criminal groups

161
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:13,180
can perform these types of attacks which

162
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:21,560
is a big problem

163
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:24,439
so therefore not only governments and

164
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,290
nation-states are more and more thinking

165
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:31,219
about how to deter these types of

166
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:37,269
attacks but also large corporations Sony

167
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:41,470
is an example for this now what exactly

168
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,470
do I want to deter

169
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:51,258
the answer is ambiguous hybrid warfare

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,979
some of you might hesitate when I say

171
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:59,240
the word warfare because we know that we

172
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:05,389
have not seen a cyber war yet there is

173
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:07,160
no outright cyber conflict in the

174
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,889
classic sense of the definition between

175
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,759
two nation states yet which is very good

176
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:18,759
that's a success however what we have

177
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:24,800
seen is a lot of tit-for-tat a lot of

178
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:28,339
exchange of attacks on a we call it left

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,389
of boom or below armed conflict

180
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:37,579
threshold level so some people say that

181
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:40,819
the prelude to war actually is the war

182
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:46,269
itself in cyber and under this

183
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:50,779
definition we already are in a state of

184
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:54,309
at least cyber conflict so some people

185
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:57,829
call it warfare some call it attacks

186
00:11:54,309 --> 00:12:01,550
some call it cyber operations it all

187
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:05,839
means the same cyber operations is now

188
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,878
being used by the Talon manual too so in

189
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,379
a couple of years we all might just use

190
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:18,740
that term so what is ambiguous mean it

191
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:22,819
means that my actions are deniable I can

192
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:27,290
launch an attack and later tell my

193
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:30,279
victim that it wasn't me we sometimes

194
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:34,579
call that the big Russian lie

195
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:37,899
the second word hybrid what does that

196
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:40,628
mean it's a new term in military affairs

197
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:44,889
basically it means that you mix

198
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:48,069
conventional forces conventional

199
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,870
capabilities with non-conventional

200
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:53,479
capabilities so I give you an example

201
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,500
what exactly how exactly ambiguous

202
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,880
hybrid cyber ops

203
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:06,110
or warfare looks like does anyone know

204
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:11,390
who this is I know you know this okay

205
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:14,460
this is the bronze soldier it's a statue

206
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:20,370
it stood in the center of Tallinn

207
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:22,740
Estonia beautiful city and in 2007 the

208
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,730
government decided to move the statue

209
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:29,010
from the center to a park not a big deal

210
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:36,300
you might might say but it was a big

211
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:42,020
deal because Estonia has a large Russian

212
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:46,829
ethnic community and this statue

213
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:52,560
portrays a Red Army soldier from World

214
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:55,410
War two and the society in Estonia is

215
00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:01,349
basically torn in half

216
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:05,610
some think that the Red Army did good a

217
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:11,010
good job and the others think not so

218
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:15,180
much so what happened is they announced

219
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:19,290
to move the soldier the statue and the

220
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:23,099
Russian media picked up on the story and

221
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,230
twisted it and it turned it into a

222
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,330
different story

223
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,870
so the new story was that this statue

224
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:34,080
would not be moved to the outskirts but

225
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:39,240
it would be destroyed in addition to

226
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:42,420
that they told they they spread more

227
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,160
news fake news for example that the

228
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:50,599
graves of soldiers would also be

229
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,819
destroyed we call this augmented

230
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:58,790
information some call it fake news this

231
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:04,450
was a phase one of this type of warfare

232
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:06,819
the result was unrest

233
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,630
hundreds of people were injured one

234
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:16,139
person died thousand I think a thousand

235
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:19,149
were arrested and shortly afterwards

236
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:23,529
phase two of this type of warfare

237
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:29,380
started which was a cyberattack a DDoS

238
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:31,810
attack which basically took out ATM

239
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:39,490
machines banking machines slowed it down

240
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:41,880
communications of ministries and as we

241
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,269
know this was a very important

242
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:49,930
experience for the nation of Estonia and

243
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:53,889
changed everything in Estonia we have

244
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:57,819
seen more grave attacks more grave

245
00:15:53,889 --> 00:16:00,670
ambiguous hybrid cyber attacks in the

246
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,420
Ukraine where the target was not only to

247
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:09,149
take out banking machines but actually

248
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:13,990
there they targeted SCADA networks and

249
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:17,790
electric power grids so this is what we

250
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:25,209
want to deter because no nation state

251
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:30,310
wants this to happen it has three kind

252
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:34,630
of types disruption espionage and

253
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:38,018
degradation what we mostly focus on are

254
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:40,630
these two mostly the third pillar

255
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:43,930
because you might say why would a

256
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:47,470
nation-state want to deter espionage

257
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:51,519
because it is conducting espionage

258
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:57,100
itself however there is a bit of a red

259
00:16:51,519 --> 00:17:01,930
line for example my country was hacked a

260
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,459
while ago who the you know the basically

261
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:09,609
the high point was last year our

262
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:13,600
Parliament was hacked and you could say

263
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:17,599
this is classic espionage however the

264
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:20,269
German government didn't think so

265
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,609
for the first time in history four weeks

266
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:27,259
ago the German government issued an

267
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:32,889
official declaration were it announced

268
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:38,230
that it accuses Russia of this hack and

269
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:43,149
it warned Russia that this type of

270
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:46,429
espionage attack is not acceptable so

271
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:50,620
these two types of things we want to

272
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:54,049
stop the degradation and some parts of

273
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,799
espionage by a Modi I mean manipulation

274
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,269
of data

275
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:01,750
MLP means manipulation of perception and

276
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:04,190
bi means to alter the balance of

277
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,960
information these are things that

278
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:11,990
nation-states might want to determine

279
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:17,649
why do I want to deter this is actually

280
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:23,120
a big debate you might think that well

281
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:26,449
it's just cyber it's not so important we

282
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,779
should more focus on nuclear weapons or

283
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,929
conventional weapons or other stuff so

284
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:35,210
there's a big discussion going on if

285
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:38,480
these types of types of cyber operations

286
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,240
are something really serious or

287
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:47,049
something not so important so this

288
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,970
cartoon I think portrays it and

289
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:53,029
basically what's happening is there's

290
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:56,059
two camps there are the Hawks and the

291
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:59,860
doves the Hawks for example Richard

292
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:02,178
Clarke one of my teachers at Harvard he

293
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,740
used to be a national security adviser

294
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:09,769
and he says that this stuff these cyber

295
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,440
weapons it's it's a game changer it will

296
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:16,370
change everything and then there is the

297
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,309
other camp for example Thomas Reid who

298
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,178
is now at King's College he says no this

299
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:27,320
is not true all the cyber operations is

300
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:30,059
just a new form of espionage and we

301
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:35,610
shouldn't freak out

302
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:39,760
so I'm for transparency in the middle

303
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:46,260
leaning a little bit hawkish and why is

304
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:50,230
that I based this on some new data that

305
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:54,220
we have comprised in our project for our

306
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:58,419
publications and mostly Brendan Mariano

307
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:02,440
from the US Marine Corps University who

308
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:07,330
was one of the groundbreaking scholars

309
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:12,149
on this topic Brennan and others we have

310
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:19,480
looked at all major cyber operations

311
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:24,149
over the last 10 20 30 years and have

312
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:28,690
basically classified them along

313
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:35,379
something new which is along their

314
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:40,389
strategic effectiveness so we were not

315
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:44,590
so interested in classifying them in

316
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:47,678
terms of is this a DDoS or a PT or what

317
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:51,158
is it but we were interested in seeing

318
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:55,480
and figuring out if these cyber

319
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:59,919
operations had a real strategic impact

320
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:04,360
on the enemy and this has not really

321
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,600
been done before and to do this we

322
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,490
looked at the escalation potential of

323
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:16,269
cyberattacks and compared it to classic

324
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:20,049
strategic weapons or measures for

325
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:23,649
example classic military power which is

326
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:28,559
nuclear conventional forces classic

327
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:32,340
economic power think you might know is a

328
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:38,408
composite index for national

329
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:42,309
capabilities and we also looked at if a

330
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,160
country does a cyber operation and it

331
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,460
has done

332
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,250
many such operations before if that

333
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,470
changes to calculus so that's what we

334
00:21:49,250 --> 00:22:00,650
call past cyber and the result is

335
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:02,810
interesting basically one of our

336
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,650
preliminary results is that the

337
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:10,429
strategic effect of cyber operations is

338
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:15,890
much weaker than that of classic

339
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:20,620
military or economic power now this is

340
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:25,960
good it's good to know it means that

341
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:30,459
some of the stuff we see is not as

342
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:36,890
impactful as we think it might be

343
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:43,310
however there is a trend which causes

344
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:48,520
concern in the past we have seen cyber

345
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:53,419
weapons that were in terms of intrusion

346
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:57,950
pretty low low quality in terms of

347
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:01,820
precision low quality and in terms of

348
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:07,760
visibility often hidden however we have

349
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:12,020
seen since Stuxnet a trend towards the

350
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,070
upper right quadrant here which means we

351
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:19,460
have highly visible highly precise

352
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:21,409
highly intrusive cyber weapons and they

353
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,540
are proliferated throughout the world

354
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:30,490
and by proliferation I mean back in the

355
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,870
days this stuff an apt like Stuxnet

356
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:38,210
could only be done by someone like

357
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:40,669
Israel and the u.s. now some other

358
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,790
players might be able to do this and

359
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,070
that's a reason for concern for the

360
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,409
future

361
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:52,060
the second

362
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:56,320
reason for concern is traditionally we

363
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:58,870
have been dealing with cyber weapons

364
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,689
within a very clearly defined domain

365
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:04,030
which is the military domain where I

366
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:09,190
want to protect airspace maritime and

367
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:11,410
land through cyberspace and if we have

368
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,380
people from the military here you know

369
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:18,070
that the main focus of cyberspace in

370
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,860
this scenario is to basically protect

371
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,800
and enable military create

372
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,550
communications and to certain type of

373
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,669
special operations but this is a domain

374
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:34,629
where the internet is not pervasive so

375
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:38,100
this is its own closed domain and I

376
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:41,980
might be able to exert a lot of control

377
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:46,389
however the new domain that we want to

378
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:50,890
protect is much larger for example if I

379
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:55,720
look at this map this is a global soak a

380
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:59,730
global risk interconnectedness map as a

381
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:03,640
bit of a mouthful but it shows you risks

382
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:06,670
that we face as societies and how they

383
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,700
are connected for example there's a food

384
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:13,920
crisis there at the top there's natural

385
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:18,780
disaster you know as all these types of

386
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:24,820
fiscal crises all these types of crises

387
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:29,410
now cyber as we know has become very

388
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:34,030
important for many verticals for the

389
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:38,260
economy for society for democracy some

390
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:42,490
people say that cyber security overlaps

391
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,550
with physical security and personal

392
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:50,470
security and corporate security so what

393
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:54,399
we've seen is that this area is becoming

394
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:58,270
bigger and bigger and more and more

395
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,540
connected with the rest meaning all the

396
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:05,490
stuff in red here is connected

397
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:08,920
- cybersecurity this has led to

398
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:15,100
militaries all over the world to

399
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:17,700
redefine their doctrinal approaches for

400
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,169
example in Germany if you read our

401
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:25,590
military strategy what the German army

402
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:30,130
should protect it now officially says

403
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:32,820
not just the classic military domain but

404
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,970
also the so called information space

405
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,679
which is everything and back in the days

406
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,260
we meant critical infrastructure like

407
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,850
nuclear power plans and stuff but now we

408
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,280
mean everything like how Siemens

409
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:50,350
communicates how we do elections it's

410
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,899
basically everything and that's a

411
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,199
problem because that creates a very

412
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:59,620
large attack surface so that's the

413
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,830
second reason for concern that what is

414
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:08,709
currently true that cyber weapons have

415
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:12,790
so far not you know created a large

416
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:16,450
strategic effect on the enemy might

417
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:22,810
change in the future now the third

418
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:28,120
reason is the matrix last time I was in

419
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:30,190
Tokyo that movie came out and we all

420
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,939
know the movie The Matrix and the

421
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:38,680
question is what is the matrix and the

422
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:41,770
answer is it depends on who you are so

423
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,460
the third reason why cyber weapons in

424
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:49,360
the future might become strategically

425
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:53,440
more effective is we might not be able

426
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:57,729
today to imagine the cyber weapon of the

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:01,780
future one of my teachers he called it

428
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:05,680
the unknown unknowns we think we can

429
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:09,760
predict but we might not be able why am

430
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:13,880
I saying this let's take Stuxnet

431
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:18,370
in Stuxnet in the Stuxnet case the

432
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:22,970
Americans looked at Stuxnet and for them

433
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:28,000
Stuxnet was a proof of concept for a

434
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:31,790
cyber weapon that can sabotage a

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,960
critical infrastructure they said okay

436
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:41,450
that's my weapon I'm doing this that's

437
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,850
working okay for the Russians they might

438
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,490
have looked at Stuxnet and they saw

439
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:51,260
something totally different

440
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:56,210
perhaps they saw that an Iranian admin

441
00:28:51,260 --> 00:29:01,460
at the power plant looked at his screen

442
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:05,540
and believed the screen more than the

443
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:09,320
physical data he had and they were like

444
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:15,350
oh that manipulation of data is the

445
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:18,560
actual weapon not the sabotaging act so

446
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:22,399
some people say that Stuxnet was an

447
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,500
eye-opener for the Russians in terms of

448
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,260
how they would hack elections in the

449
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,880
future and others they would manipulate

450
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,540
data they didn't they wouldn't have to

451
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,250
destroy it

452
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:37,280
so this is a third reason for concern

453
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,470
now I want to quickly move to how to

454
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,120
deter because this is what we all want

455
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:47,690
to learn what can we do first

456
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:51,080
the rule of law very important we are in

457
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:55,190
a legal setting here we have to tell in

458
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,710
manual around 236 pages and now we have

459
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,530
the tally manual to double the size it's

460
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:07,160
like nearly 600 pages who has read the

461
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:10,250
whole thing ok nobody has the truth is

462
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:14,300
the rule of law is not working in

463
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:17,300
cyberspace unfortunately I have very

464
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,960
much hope it will we have though no

465
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,820
rules for the road in cyberspace yet we

466
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,059
have a couple of my lateral green

467
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:32,820
u.s. Chinese German Chinese some other

468
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:36,178
stuff forget it it's not working so the

469
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:41,309
second tool we could use if we have no

470
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:44,010
rules we could use the economy this is

471
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:46,529
what the Israelis do this is from a

472
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,149
friend of mine who is running what I run

473
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:52,649
in Germany is running that in Israel

474
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:55,350
these are all Israeli startups so what

475
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:59,219
Israel has done very successfully they

476
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:02,820
identified key areas that need to be

477
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,130
protected within their society

478
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,678
you know ecommerce enterprise mobility

479
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:13,080
cyber posture blah blah blah the whole

480
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:17,039
thing and then they created startups in

481
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,470
these packets or fostered them or the

482
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,970
investment and they specifically are

483
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:27,440
facing focusing on the stuff that's red

484
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:30,480
which is also dual use for the military

485
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,600
so you have basically cyber physical

486
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,279
systems in there other stuff that can

487
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,010
also be used for the military so that's

488
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,309
option one and I know that there is a

489
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:44,879
growing startup community and philosophy

490
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:50,940
in Japan for cyber and that's something

491
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:54,690
very positive option number two is you

492
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:57,899
want to make smart decisions within your

493
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,970
leadership on what horse to bet on

494
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,570
because there's a lot of stuff going on

495
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:05,640
in cyber security but what is going to

496
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,850
really be important in a couple of years

497
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,870
down the road well nobody knows but the

498
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,870
people from Gartner

499
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,879
tell us that they know and sell us their

500
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,039
predictions for a lot of money so this

501
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,730
is one of the Gartner so-called hype

502
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:24,510
indices and it shows you which

503
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:29,309
technology in cyber security is mature

504
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:31,710
so you can sell it within a framework of

505
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:33,408
you know fireEye or Accenture or

506
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,970
something that's on the very right side

507
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:39,530
that's the plateau of

508
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:43,530
activity that stuff we already sell and

509
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:47,100
packaged and then on the very left side

510
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:50,760
is the stuff that's kind of little

511
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:54,510
science fiction still and often we see

512
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,930
that these topics are hyped and then

513
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:00,750
there is a bit of a they call the TRO of

514
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:03,480
disillusionment you know because often

515
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:06,390
we see mmm is my threat intelligence

516
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,740
platform really performing you know is

517
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,350
there really machine learning and and

518
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,980
stuff like that so what's interesting is

519
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:16,080
I think there are three areas that might

520
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,330
be interesting for a society like Japan

521
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,659
or Germany one is hardware based

522
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:25,290
security chip level basically the other

523
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:28,320
one is threat intelligence platforms and

524
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:31,020
the third one is very early but breach

525
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,889
and attack simulations that's again very

526
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:40,320
useful for dual use so the third thing

527
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:42,480
you can do is naming and shaming this

528
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,790
photo up there I could tell you the

529
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,190
names of these four people because the

530
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,409
Netherlands this is the Secretary of

531
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,910
Defense of the Netherlands sitting there

532
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,330
one of her generals

533
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:56,340
just two months ago they did a press

534
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,780
conference telling the world the names

535
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:04,590
of these four guys and these are Russian

536
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:08,759
GRU GRU special operative operations

537
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:12,000
spies basically and this is a photo from

538
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,240
the airport somewhere and they're on the

539
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,290
way to Amsterdam I think to hack the

540
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:23,429
chemical something organization so this

541
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:26,040
is revolutionary that a government in

542
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:29,449
Europe does that it's never happened

543
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,800
before we call it naming and shaming

544
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:36,960
it's something you can do

545
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:40,290
Japan can do this you tell your enemy

546
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,320
that you know what he did and you also

547
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,420
tell your own population that you're not

548
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,540
okay with us starting a discussion

549
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,480
within the population

550
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:53,480
prepare your population for the next

551
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,060
attack where you might react with a

552
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,350
counter-strike so this this is what's

553
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,570
happening right now

554
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:02,930
Germany is doing the same we call in

555
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:07,310
naming and shaming also you criminalize

556
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:09,140
these attackers and pursue them through

557
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,500
the courts through Interpol and other

558
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,690
stuff it's very effective the other

559
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,630
thing is you can do sanctions the

560
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:20,900
Americans like to do that a lot

561
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:23,830
economic diplomatic you know we've seen

562
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:28,850
that Obama and President Obama did this

563
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:31,580
after the election hack he kicked some

564
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,560
diplomats out of the country that's a

565
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:38,270
that's another option you have as a

566
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:41,029
nation-state and finally you can create

567
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,800
a Cyber Command so we did that in

568
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,610
Germany this is the logo of the German

569
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,070
Cyber Command it's it's in Bonn and we

570
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:51,920
are now integrating it with our

571
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:54,970
bundesamt facie height psi which is run

572
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,460
under the Ministry of the Interior and

573
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,180
with the intelligence community and it's

574
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:05,840
very complicated thing to integrate

575
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:08,779
these players in cyber security and I'm

576
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:13,580
sure in Japan very smart people are

577
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:16,340
thinking about how to get this right so

578
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:19,640
this basically leads me to what my

579
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,830
project has been working on it's a

580
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:27,859
framework we call it agile cyber

581
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:34,600
deterrence which combines all of the

582
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:38,290
above this is our copyrighted not really

583
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,810
definition of agile cyber deterrence

584
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:46,820
what's important here is that it's a mix

585
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:48,470
of denial cost imposition and supporting

586
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,140
strategies I'll get to that in a minute

587
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:53,330
in domain as well as out domain so

588
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,460
within cyber but also outside of cyber

589
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,610
and what's really important is you want

590
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,160
to deter not only the classic armed

591
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:06,200
attack as the UN

592
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,480
defines it opteka 51 or 2 you know but

593
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:12,560
you want to also deter the stuff that

594
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:19,100
happens left of boom that happens before

595
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:23,860
the actual legal attack takes place so

596
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:29,330
our framework is based on four pillars

597
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:32,480
first you want to define what an attack

598
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:35,509
is and signal it communicate it clearly

599
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,070
to Yanam to your enemy so that he knows

600
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:45,260
oh if I do this I'm in trouble this

601
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:47,780
means basically that you need to define

602
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:52,700
for your society what is really crucial

603
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:56,390
and what is not and we and Germany

604
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,339
currently focus on the very right end of

605
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,529
this which is got a critical

606
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:04,850
infrastructure stuff like that but also

607
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:07,430
an election an election might be a taboo

608
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:10,130
you know you might signal to your enemy

609
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,890
to hack your election okay it's not a

610
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,530
nuclear power plant but still you don't

611
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:19,100
want that so this is important for your

612
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:22,130
society to figure out what is the taboo

613
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,750
and what is not then I don't have to

614
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,660
talk about denial this is what we all

615
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:30,650
deal with we want to increase cyber

616
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:33,529
resilience our defenses cost imposition

617
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:40,180
is very very controversial topic as you

618
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:42,980
all know how can you do offensive stuff

619
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,230
especially as a country like Japan or

620
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,820
Germany is very difficult to say how can

621
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:52,340
you at all raise the cost of an attacker

622
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:54,590
discussion about it we don't have time

623
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,090
to go into this supportive measures is

624
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:00,650
everything that the intelligence

625
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:02,120
community does embedded attribution

626
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:06,680
stuff like that

627
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:09,319
so finally what our policy options for

628
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,230
cyber middle powers like Germany or

629
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Japan well for Japan it's interesting

630
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:18,140
because you are in a difficult spot

631
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,220
there's China that wants to bridge the

632
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,509
external gap they want to catch up

633
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,680
mostly with the US so they have engaged

634
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:32,390
in theft of intellectual property that's

635
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:35,839
bad you know that's that's fostering

636
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:39,319
their agenda what's good for us is they

637
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,420
also focus on internal issues they don't

638
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,180
want to have a revolution from inside so

639
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,970
they might be occupied with that Russia

640
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,970
is released as we know they are in a

641
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:53,120
weak position they want to get bigger

642
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:57,080
their expansionist but the good thing is

643
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,990
they have a low budget so then you come

644
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,319
to the u.s. they have domain superiority

645
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:06,350
not just in cyber but in other domains

646
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:10,880
that's bad for enemies of the u.s. good

647
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:13,549
for its friends what's also good for the

648
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,190
US as enemies is the u.s. is always very

649
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,690
hesitant to use its capabilities because

650
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,630
they don't want the enemies to know

651
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:23,210
about it so there's a bit of an

652
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:28,370
equilibrium him talking quickly because

653
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:31,940
I run out of time about China Japan is

654
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:35,080
facing something that my colleagues in

655
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:38,990
Australia call picking flowers in

656
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:42,650
foreign countries and making honey at

657
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:47,080
home in China so one thing that China

658
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:47,080
and that Japan is facing is basically

659
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:54,710
they look at technology in Japan they

660
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,380
look at know-how at universities they

661
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,510
might bring it back to their own turf

662
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,030
and use it for their own cyber

663
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,520
capabilities so this is something you

664
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,410
should have on the screen there's a new

665
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,250
study about this from the Australian

666
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:13,220
Institute for Strategic Studies and

667
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:16,700
finally there's a lot of stuff happening

668
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:19,759
in the mergers and acquisitions market

669
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,879
big players I mean you have Softbank but

670
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,910
big players are buying up cybersecurity

671
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,800
startups all over the board it's a boom

672
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,500
for cybersecurity emerges in

673
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,040
acquisitions

674
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,760
the market is now 95 billion its

675
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,430
projected to be 365 billion and 2026

676
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:45,030
that is huge so you want to get your M&A

677
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:49,529
market right finally the message I just

678
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:53,300
want to you know bring from Germany so

679
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:57,210
to say to you as a cyber middle power

680
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:02,210
you can actually have strategic

681
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:06,119
influence if you partner with others

682
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:08,730
within a network structure that has

683
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,160
specific capabilities assigned to the

684
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,560
partners so there's a long theory in

685
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:17,910
international affairs about the network

686
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:20,609
view of power for middle part for middle

687
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:23,430
powers like Japan or Germany and what's

688
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:27,330
happening is we apply this to cyber

689
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:28,618
power so one thing the Germany is doing

690
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,980
right now we are partnering with the

691
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:36,240
Netherlands with friends with Luxembourg

692
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:40,400
with Estonia with other middle powers so

693
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:44,669
to say form coalition's of the Willing

694
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,359
to basically have a better posture in

695
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:53,490
cyber security visa vie the cyber

696
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:57,450
superpowers such as China u.s. or with

697
00:42:53,490 --> 00:43:00,750
the US Russia and I think a partnership

698
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:03,990
between Germany and Japan would be

699
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:08,570
something valuable potentially valuable

700
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:11,069
in the future in the space so that's it

701
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:14,099
if you're bored you can read about all

702
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,609
