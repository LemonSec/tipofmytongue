1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:11,490
thank you very much thank you very much

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,789
for having me on to say thank you for

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,960
you know having me here the organizers

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:21,560
of good blue toucan and her team and to

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,960
my very good friend

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,509
Daiki who actually I said he's the

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,140
culprit his is the reason I'm here I met

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,050
Dyke in 2015 when we walked an

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,020
international case together and I

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,129
finally had the opportunity to put her

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,829
face you know to the name and the reason

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,940
that case was successful is the reason

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,570
I'm here to talk about the international

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:54,500
collaboration a tool for combating cyber

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,980
crime first I'd like to take a survey

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:02,010
how many of us here know about mutual

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,009
legal assistance or treaty the M lat

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,030
treaty if you know can you just signify

19
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:13,320
by raising your hand okay well that's

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,360
the formal way where a country can talk

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,639
to another country and pass information

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,150
and do investigation that is the formal

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,180
channel but on fortunately it's a very

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,049
very slow process a lot of the time it

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,810
doesn't work not because it's maybe

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,020
different reasons and it hasn't been

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,600
very effective when it comes to cyber

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,970
crime investigation as we all know

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,189
cybercrime investigation is time-bound

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,789
we're talking about IPS that are dynamic

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,100
we're talking about information that if

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,770
it's not you know her nest immediately

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,009
you might not be able to get it the last

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,960
week I talked about service and how

35
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,020
about a situation where the person who

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,130
actually after he made so much money out

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,500
of the the crime takes off to a place

38
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,869
where you can find him the end of the

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,530
investigation you are also unable to get

40
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,819
the mastermind so I'll take a quick

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,670
rundown or

42
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,010
my presentation I take a second Sophie

43
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,760
how many of us ever knew has ever heard

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:27,060
about the efcc

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,920
okay just a very small so I'm going to

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,230
talk about the FCC the agency I

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,390
represent I'll talk a bit about myself

48
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:40,920
and there's a notion that Nigeria has

49
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,839
the monopoly of cybercrime or the

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,700
business email compromise so I'm going

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,180
to for that reason I want to give you a

52
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,879
rundown of a little history and some

53
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,840
information you might need to know I'll

54
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,090
tell you about what the FCC does and

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,730
I'll discuss some problems that we also

56
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,120
have seen in the area of cyber crime

57
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,030
investigation I'll talk about the real

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,959
meat of my presentation which is

59
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,340
collaboration an instance of what

60
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,049
collaboration was able to achieve and

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,659
then of run through and finish up my

62
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:22,669
presentation now the economic and

63
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:28,470
Financial Crimes Commission the e FCC

64
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:30,919
was born in - in 2003 because of the

65
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,169
same reasons you have been talking about

66
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:38,040
why a lot of cyber crime activities

67
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:43,019
coming out of Nigeria and to that effect

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:46,168
this agency the FCC is empowered to

69
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,260
investigate and persecute all economic

70
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,540
and financial crimes were like well

71
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,209
federal law enforcement agency just like

72
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,828
the Nigerian police force but our

73
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,359
purview is streamlined - you know

74
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:03,720
economic and financial crimes

75
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,530
you know matters and we received

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,919
complaint

77
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,069
complaints from you know different

78
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,349
quotas we have of a website where you

79
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,199
can send you no complaints channel you

80
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,589
can channel your complaints directly you

81
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,570
also we also have you know the situation

82
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,869
whereby people who are within Nigeria

83
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:29,099
can do us a formal petition and drop at

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,780
any of our offices and to that effect

85
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,820
also and force anything that has to do

86
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,330
with economic and financial crimes

87
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,070
related matters offices I eleven were

88
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:44,219
pretty very small across the entire

89
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:46,409
country of Nigeria you might not have an

90
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,050
idea of what I'm talking about

91
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,600
what policing nearly 200 million people

92
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:56,070
I know of the population of Japan to be

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,220
about 120 something million so Japan is

94
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:02,400
almost about the half of Nigeria so you

95
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,700
have your imagining you know a police

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,590
formation that is you know pretty small

97
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:13,950
and tasked with a lot of you know job to

98
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,789
do in terms of combating this serous

99
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,950
minus-- and I shall be talking about

100
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,440
another thing we do again is partnering

101
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:26,099
with law local and foreign law

102
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,140
enforcement agencies and that's why I'll

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,270
take my toad survey are you a police

104
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,190
officer in Japan can I just see your

105
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,200
hand up police officer a law enforcement

106
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,450
person in Japan okay

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,000
maybe at the end of the my presentation

108
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,010
I'll be happy to to have friends with

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,170
the law enforcement people in Japan it's

110
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,480
pretty important to us as part of what

111
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:53,460
we do in order to achieve successes now

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,570
these are the offices we have like I

113
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,219
said their level we have the

114
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,830
headquarters office in the Federal

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,240
Capital Territory which is Abuja we have

116
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,099
the next big office which is in Lagos

117
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,290
Metropolitan State towards the southwest

118
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:13,230
of Nigeria it's about the action sport

119
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,890
of my agency and that's where I work out

120
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,320
from a bit about myself I have a

121
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,229
background in computer science and I've

122
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,400
been with the agency since 2009 to date

123
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:29,610
and walked many cases local and

124
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:35,640
international I've also had background

125
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:37,919
in digital forensics and just before I

126
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,490
left I was heading the digital forensics

127
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,049
lab in Lagos office but at the moment

128
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,169
I'm studying in

129
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,819
Hallam University in South Korea so I'm

130
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,639
actually on neighbor just two or two

131
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,879
hours away and there I'm doing my

132
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,669
master's program very good a bit of

133
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:01,409
history like I said Africa a lot of

134
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:05,068
people ask is Africa a country No Africa

135
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:09,930
is a continent we Africa has you know

136
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:12,240
consists of about 54 countries and it

137
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:16,560
has a very large population 1.2 billion

138
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,110
people and has a lot of history like

139
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,500
I've written there very importantly

140
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:24,900
Africa has the African Union and

141
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,409
something that is unique about Africa is

142
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,080
that we got colonized by maybe the West

143
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,180
Europe and all that so whichever country

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,580
colonized you that's the language that

145
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,729
is predominantly spoken so Nigeria was

146
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,919
colonized by the English so we speak

147
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:44,128
from a predominantly English you have

148
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:49,620
Arabic you of Portuguese you have French

149
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:52,530
as the case may be if you look at Africa

150
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,990
is divided into sub regions you have the

151
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,750
North Africa you have the southern

152
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,419
Africa of the Eastern Africa Nigeria is

153
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,830
found in the western Africa of the

154
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,049
middle Africa and you have sir pretty

155
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:11,758
interesting history you can find time to

156
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:15,180
go through like I said Nigeria is found

157
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,509
in the western Africa and it's it's

158
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:24,449
actually the most populated country in

159
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:28,969
Africa an overview of Nigeria that's

160
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:33,570
Nigeria there you have a land mass of

161
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:37,770
923 about that kilometers you know you

162
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,620
have a population of 195 million that's

163
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:45,420
been conservative we're about 200

164
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:49,680
million we have a large usage of the

165
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:54,079
internet and of 77 percent of of our

166
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,380
banks and financial institutions run on

167
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,410
the Internet

168
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,800
like I said the in terms of Internet

169
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,800
penetration you have Nigeria topping in

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:12,819
the region there about that and that's

171
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:16,390
about that that was a record of 2014 it

172
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:20,140
grew to eighty million users so you have

173
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:23,830
an idea why do you have a lot of users

174
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,980
that have access to the Internet and I

175
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,520
able to do so many things on the

176
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,420
Internet

177
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,270
in fact the population of the internet

178
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,930
uses alone is even over some countries

179
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,770
like Korea has a population of think

180
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,750
about fourteen million or they're about

181
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,540
the state Lagos where I'm working from

182
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,430
as a population of 22 million people so

183
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,410
that state alone is bigger than any

184
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,479
country so you can expect a lot of

185
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:58,870
internet activities coming out of

186
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:01,210
Nigeria the history of the internet

187
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,460
fraud in Nigeria and what the efcc has

188
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,820
been able to carry out since its birth

189
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,210
is that internet fraud actually dated

190
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,620
back into the 1980s and started very

191
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:19,960
traditional where it was then known as

192
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:23,410
doubling of money local you know Palance

193
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,620
is called wash wash means somebody will

194
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:29,290
tell you show you some sort of chemical

195
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,990
and he quickly does it you don't even

196
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,240
know he puts it in the chemical then

197
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,540
brings out a dollar bill and tells you

198
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,120
if you can pay some money I would double

199
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,459
the money for you and all Rubio's so

200
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,620
people reached out to go and get monies

201
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,080
from their families don't worry borrow

202
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,300
me money the moment I you know by

203
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,970
tomorrow I'll give you your money back

204
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,819
so that was how you know it started

205
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:59,020
gradually and it progressed in the early

206
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,510
2000s to skills of social engineering

207
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,090
where they go online and you see romance

208
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:07,120
scam where they begin to reach out to

209
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,450
people online you have inheritance scam

210
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,820
someone telling you have very big assets

211
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,790
where all I just need you to do is to

212
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,850
send me some money and I will you know

213
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,589
clear the inheritance and I'll give you

214
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,080
a percentage I could even give you an

215
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:26,740
interest and that was working like I

216
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,280
said romance cam you have people who may

217
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,770
be lonely and um have relationships that

218
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,839
have been broken and then they reach out

219
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,850
to this kind of category of people and

220
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,010
then the fall for the scam

221
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,190
sometimes they impersonate military

222
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,840
personnel and you know love our people

223
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,150
and then they reach out to volunteer

224
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,240
with vulnerable people and take

225
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,100
advantage of them some could be

226
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,230
contracts come and some could be jobs

227
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,410
camp so these things were what we are

228
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,510
observing in the early 2000 it moved on

229
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,610
to the kind of scheme we see in 2010 and

230
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:07,060
there about became more sophisticated

231
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,490
where you have the use of you know more

232
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,819
technical skills like DDoS attack warms

233
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,670
viruses and you know defacement of

234
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,490
websites was predominant about that time

235
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,469
and then they could get some tools

236
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,990
off-the-shelf already developed tools

237
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,920
that it will just get at no almost no

238
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:30,400
cost to deploy through the dark web so

239
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,490
these were the trends were seen Nigeria

240
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,439
particularly what we what the trend we

241
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:40,330
observed the real headline of it was for

242
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,840
financial purposes they just wanted to

243
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:46,090
make money with a lot of excuses some

244
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,510
tell you did because we were poor oh

245
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,370
yeah and that's where I'm also from and

246
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,819
some tell you they we don't have parents

247
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,850
who can take care of us well yes yours

248
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,550
is even better I also lost my father too

249
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,030
so you see there's really the the real

250
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:08,140
essence of it is for financial benefits

251
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:10,600
we saw different categories of this

252
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,410
crime some people acted all by

253
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,990
themselves

254
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,969
that was what we always saw but others

255
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,610
acted in a group they had a more

256
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,370
organized group where they were well

257
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,010
structured the person on top is the

258
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,820
chairman or the org

259
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:31,319
as it is called and he he breaks the

260
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,880
task down some people bring in the

261
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,980
vulnerably you know the vulnerable

262
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,180
people and then some people could take

263
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:45,820
over and do the attacks so we saw all of

264
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:48,160
this kind of structures then the

265
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,830
business email compromised came in where

266
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,400
we saw in 2015 which was about the peak

267
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,890
of it all you know also known as CEO

268
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,240
fraud man-in-the-middle attack was also

269
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:05,380
very predominant - these are the kinds

270
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:10,000
of schemes we saw the sorry I go back a

271
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,310
bit we saw you know the use of key

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,650
loggers and I'm some of us may be aware

273
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,280
of that spearfishing use of Trojan

274
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:20,020
viruses of Trojan and malware's were

275
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,480
also predominant this way

276
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,140
the kind of things were seen I took this

277
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,040
survey from Trend Micro pretty very much

278
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,030
what we were seeing

279
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,980
progressed upon to open to that time

280
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,140
where we saw a lot of activities coming

281
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:40,270
out you know just the trend as we were

282
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:45,280
seeing it and then between 2012 and 2018

283
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:47,980
we saw like like I just explained now

284
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:53,170
what is the position of the Nigerian

285
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:55,630
state in response to cyber crime in 2015

286
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,229
they the passed the bill called the

287
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:03,160
cyber crime act and this was very much

288
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,620
tailored you know a tool we have that is

289
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,650
very very much tailored to the current

290
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,830
crimes we see in cybercrime so it is

291
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:15,209
very is punishable so anyone caught

292
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,050
committing cyber crime home or abroad is

293
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,570
culpable and is punished

294
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,900
you know punished for it so the Nigerian

295
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:25,870
community is completely against cyber

296
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,090
crime so we have the advance tree for

297
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,910
that and that adds who also penalizes

298
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:36,910
anybody who is even aiding and abetting

299
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,839
cybercrime so it's it's it's a it is not

300
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,949
enough that

301
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,260
you claim your activities you need to

302
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,410
you need to do much more to show that

303
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,350
you did not support the action of

304
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,589
cybercrime so in Nigeria it is seriously

305
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,230
frowned at and the establishment act of

306
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:59,440
the economic and financial crimes is

307
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,590
also very very importantly - and with

308
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,680
that we've been able to achieve a lot of

309
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:10,210
activities in terms of combating cyber

310
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,280
crime so basically we caused

311
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,460
investigation we arrested the

312
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:20,500
perpetrators would prosecute them that's

313
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:22,690
our main goal and our joy we importantly

314
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,330
we restitute whatever we've you know

315
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,340
assets that are traceable to the offense

316
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,280
that has been committed were Resta - to

317
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,560
the victims now I put Federation there

318
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,980
because besides cybercrime there are

319
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,229
other things that the efcc does you know

320
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,990
inter white-collar crimes that the FCC

321
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,540
does including corruption cases and all

322
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,270
of that so basically that we do a lot of

323
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:50,290
that - so if you have corrupt officials

324
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:52,240
who took government funds you know those

325
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,550
funds will be repatriated back you know

326
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,770
refunded back to the federal government

327
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:03,370
so that's what the EFC does in 2015

328
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:06,910
that's the record of the executive

329
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:09,760
chairman you know trying to say was was

330
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:12,310
published published there was a return

331
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,980
of money to a Polish victim who lost

332
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,909
money and several others there's so many

333
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,940
of them I just picked one out of them

334
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:25,990
now to the problem of cybercrime

335
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,760
particularly BC the agency called the

336
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,260
Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

337
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:35,890
United States recorded in 2017 from what

338
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:42,700
they receive as reports of losses in

339
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:46,180
cybercrime and it was 675 million US

340
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:50,100
dollars I again I say that's just the

341
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:53,610
FBI we've not talked about what

342
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,070
Asia records in terms of losses to

343
00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:00,959
cybercrime there's a report there and

344
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:03,149
that's in 28 in August of sharp rise and

345
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,750
business business email compromised

346
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,260
the point again is that it is not going

347
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,100
down

348
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,460
why is it not going down because this

349
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,760
business brings in a lot of money almost

350
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,280
at no risk if you whatever job you are

351
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,930
doing currently there are risks and yet

352
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,600
you do them because you get some

353
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,090
benefits now these guys do this thing

354
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,510
with a lot of motivation so the point

355
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:33,060
again is that if you are looking at you

356
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,370
know cyber crime going down sorry you'll

357
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,290
be disappointed if you are thinking the

358
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,840
trend will go down because we are here

359
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,510
in a conference I'm sorry to tell you

360
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,959
that these guys make 12.5 billion in

361
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:47,010
scam in in in income and then you tell

362
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,500
them to go away

363
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,870
you know the Nichols spoke about you

364
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,980
know a tweet where he said I can't face

365
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:58,649
the you know the the feds yes because if

366
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,770
whatever term he serves and he has this

367
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,770
as a back-up plan is a good investment I

368
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,810
tell you so for us in this community

369
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,030
have this at the back of your mind that

370
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:12,360
we're up against something that is

371
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:15,720
pretty very tall and what is the best

372
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:20,429
way to to walk at it and bring it to a

373
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:24,000
halt well reduce it largely so like I

374
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:26,880
said it's very very you know unreported

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,150
like all these records they have to show

376
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,150
for it

377
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,930
Trend Micro again says the business

378
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:39,510
email compromise is on the rise

379
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:41,550
everywhere it is on the rise so what the

380
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,860
loss is cuts across every continent so

381
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,940
if you if you are thinking that maybe

382
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,320
the losses are just for victims from us

383
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,510
you may be very disappointed that you

384
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,450
may have lost you know losses to record

385
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,250
recorded here to in Japan and maybe any

386
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,890
other Asian country or your condo or

387
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,680
country where you you come from what

388
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,840
problem do we see again as a reason why

389
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,559
we are unable to achieve very much

390
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,418
is that we walk you know in silos you

391
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,760
walk as an individual you are

392
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,740
self-sufficient and unfortunately our

393
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,100
laws haven't helped us very much our

394
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:21,809
laws more centered on you know your

395
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,959
country and you know pretty much selfish

396
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:28,020
so it hasn't helped us so you have

397
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,279
somebody walk in cybercrime he's just

398
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,690
there all by himself

399
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,340
even in the same country you have

400
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,590
different agencies they just don't talk

401
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,199
to each other it's a lot of problem not

402
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,389
to even talk about them communicating

403
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,140
with other stakeholders like the private

404
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:45,390
sector and the academia so the working

405
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,970
inside us is a big problem huge problem

406
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,580
that you know at the end of the

407
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,500
conference like this the complimentary

408
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,139
card you get to exchange with someone

409
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,409
you know you or you receive some from

410
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,870
someone shouldn't just end you know like

411
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:02,730
another people in your shelf but let's

412
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,649
walk it out let's put it to use talk to

413
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,940
someone talk let him talk to you share

414
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:10,379
information and we'll be able to do more

415
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,990
walls of jurisdiction like I said the

416
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,899
laws that just you know that's really

417
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:20,390
nothing you can do about it maybe none

418
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:23,309
of us was here was introduced as a

419
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:25,860
legislature in his country of course

420
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:29,520
because you know that's the those are

421
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,840
the lawmakers and this if if you are not

422
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,309
a lawmaker then the truth is that

423
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,918
there's nothing you can do about

424
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,960
changing the law so if there's not you

425
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,320
can do about changing the Lord and how

426
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,600
can we walk together you know to get

427
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,520
this job done if you were a law

428
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,250
enforcement person you just like a

429
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,620
nickel talked again she said you are the

430
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,750
last you know line of defense you

431
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,020
expected whatever intelligence the

432
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:57,929
private sectors gather it's you it's

433
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,179
transmitted to now how about when it

434
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,760
when this crime happens beyond your

435
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:06,360
border do you also have powers to

436
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,970
execute you you know your your your your

437
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,158
your your your your part you know you

438
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,830
did the strength of your country are you

439
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,409
able to to carry it beyond Japan or

440
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,399
carried beyond any other country not at

441
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:22,740
all so

442
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:25,890
if we have laws that allows only 4m

443
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,620
locked which takes almost forever to

444
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,650
achieve the point I'm driving is it

445
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,629
driving at is that there are all there's

446
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,330
another channel by which we can walk and

447
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,390
that channel is what I'm proposing which

448
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,570
is we all know walking together so

449
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,730
walking together will help us to achieve

450
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,679
even when this walls of our laws are

451
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,320
there and there's nothing you can do

452
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,120
about that we have low information

453
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,360
sharing like I said you know we hardly

454
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,969
talk to each other and Nicole just said

455
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,610
mostly what I wanted to say you have the

456
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:03,300
law enforcement people knowing next to

457
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:05,159
not nothing like I said in 2003 you was

458
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,500
the birth of the Year secede the more

459
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,620
traditional police people did not know

460
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,740
very much about investigating you know

461
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,600
cybercrime and evenly it still is the

462
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,270
situation of you know put up until date

463
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,300
until younger people came in into the

464
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,340
system you know it was pretty and it is

465
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,250
still very difficult for them to

466
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,230
understand what an IP is you know I had

467
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,720
a friend who told me that he was taught

468
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:34,230
how to write in one two three that's

469
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,000
numbers and ABC for the english-speaking

470
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,559
people and now they combine things

471
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,480
together and then confuse him so he

472
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,190
doesn't like Sciences so there are so

473
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,840
many people who are out there too

474
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,050
who get confused when you are talking

475
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,600
about IP Oh Lord what is this I prefer

476
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,110
to do you know model cases I prefer to

477
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,809
do robbery cases saying things that are

478
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:58,379
practically not understandable we also

479
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:00,870
have criminals who we always forget they

480
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,610
also understand the laws criminals know

481
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,139
that this country doesn't talk to this

482
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,820
country so they know where to position

483
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,610
themselves they know where to channel

484
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,490
you know monies to and then you know

485
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,559
they they are waiting for the feds to to

486
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,900
take all forever to talk you know which

487
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:18,450
will happen which will not happen so

488
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,480
criminals also understand the law you

489
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,000
also you also you know holding they know

490
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,590
the weaknesses of this loss and they

491
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,440
have been able to take advantage don't

492
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,270
forget they are intelligent people - yes

493
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,200
maybe the make mistakes that's why we

494
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,639
get them get

495
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,679
to catch them but they pretty are pretty

496
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:37,799
much good at what they are doing that's

497
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:41,789
why they've been able to go so far the

498
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:44,309
use of VPNs also obscures from scene

499
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:47,789
very much and has been part of the

500
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:51,090
challenge that we have also noticed safe

501
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:53,220
havens that's the one very important

502
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,860
aspect of the challenge I want to talk

503
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,799
about their destination countries if you

504
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,469
if you tell me that these crimes

505
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,389
originate from Nigeria so how come the

506
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,919
money's moved to some part of Asia to

507
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:07,049
some countries in Asia

508
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,419
the money's moved to some countries in

509
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,820
the Middle East before it gets so it

510
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:14,760
means that they have people like them in

511
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:18,689
these countries so if this money's get

512
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,360
to your country what do you do about it

513
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,669
do you do next to nothing are you

514
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,158
willing to work with another person who

515
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:27,389
is saying there was a loss of money from

516
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,539
this country and has moved to your

517
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:32,699
country the moment they know that

518
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:35,460
whatever country it is is no longer a

519
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,789
safe haven for financial you know

520
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,010
money's moving to yes they or if you

521
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,870
open a bank account and then you you you

522
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,330
aid the movement of that money to

523
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,168
another person you become liable it

524
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:52,289
becomes you know we begin to clamp down

525
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:56,899
more on their activities what's the way

526
00:25:52,289 --> 00:26:00,029
forward strongly collaboration

527
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:03,000
commitments from countries that are you

528
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:08,610
know strong to work with countries that

529
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,870
are less strong in terms of resources in

530
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:15,059
terms of technological wise from what we

531
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,559
observe these guys when they talk online

532
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,120
sometimes they don't even know who they

533
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,059
are talking to but there's a lot of

534
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,879
trust amongst them they are talking they

535
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,370
say who can tell me how I can hack into

536
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,980
a bank without being noticed you begin

537
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,709
to see imputes from different you know

538
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,419
people on their forum how you can

539
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,549
quickly do it without being noticed you

540
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:38,100
see better and more innovative ways of

541
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,379
achieving it but unfortunately we the

542
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,389
good guys aren't able to talk unable to

543
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:45,030
share ideas weren't able to support each

544
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:47,959
other so the way forward is quad

545
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,370
now talk about the instance of the

546
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,900
initiative we had with the Federal

547
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,110
Bureau of Investigation we walk with

548
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,320
them a lot early early this year they

549
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:00,570
came with an initiative called why our

550
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,090
initiative they wanted to do a joint

551
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,389
operation with the FCC they also

552
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:10,290
informed us that a lot of countries also

553
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:12,750
part of this operation and the takedown

554
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,790
was going to be similar in US and like

555
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,340
usual we were happy at that and we

556
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,889
jumped at it to work with them so they

557
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,610
sent the agents down with a lot of

558
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,060
information

559
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,469
the FCC went out did surveillance these

560
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,810
are the countries that are involved we

561
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,820
have the United States they have Canada

562
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,220
there you have pool and you have

563
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,350
Malaysia your Mauritius you have

564
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,440
Indonesia and of course you have Nigeria

565
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:40,080
so the point again is that all the BC

566
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,870
cases you see are not all settling in

567
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,600
Nigeria the other countries to where it

568
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:48,209
happens nobody's really proud of it but

569
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,350
you know that's the reality we have on

570
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:55,470
our hands so we had this joint

571
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,990
operations with the U FBI we gathered

572
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:01,320
intelligence went off of the oppression

573
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:04,920
and 29 of them are the instance in June

574
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,129
we arrested and very much awaiting

575
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,990
prosecution and afterwards the operation

576
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,600
has been ongoing even when I left home

577
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:16,020
the operation has been ongoing and more

578
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,490
people have been arrested like I said

579
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,620
these were multiple countries that were

580
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,150
involved

581
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,689
that's a cross-section of the guys that

582
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:27,210
we arrested at the time so these are

583
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,730
actions that we're very interested in

584
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:33,480
carrying out it was publicized it was in

585
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:35,400
the media everywhere FBI arrests 74 in

586
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,980
Nigeria u.s. other and you know other

587
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,010
places in the body you see that the efcc

588
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,950
was also mentioned as part of what you

589
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:47,070
know contribution and that's why we're

590
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,380
very much interested in working with you

591
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,870
know law enforcement agents around the

592
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,390
world that's a guy in the middle that I

593
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,250
think it looks like somebody I knew yeah

594
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,040
that's that's what we walked together

595
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:02,460
under now what did we learn

596
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,070
first there was a message that we sent

597
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,090
out to these fraudsters discriminants

598
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:11,129
that these countries are not countries

599
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,560
that are safe for you even if you get

600
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,470
run out of nigeria even if you get to

601
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,050
such countries you are not also safe

602
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:22,620
there it's a message of deterrence that

603
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,409
we sent second lesson we learnt is that

604
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,989
it is possible to walk together you even

605
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:30,480
if you are from any country it is

606
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,990
possible to walk with like I said the

607
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,840
amulet is a pretty very long process if

608
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:40,590
we can walk together and the efcc is

609
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,240
foremost in in in its interest to walk

610
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,050
with any law enforcement agency from any

611
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,380
country we also saw that you know

612
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:53,820
communicating police put to police was

613
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:56,100
was was was was beautiful there was a

614
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,870
lot of information sharing in the course

615
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,330
of investigation we gathered more

616
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:03,179
information from them and I like to say

617
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:06,449
I at a point I ever got to meet the guys

618
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:09,000
you know the public private sector guys

619
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,610
who also provided the information to the

620
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,820
FBI and it was it was we're all very

621
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,820
happy it produces a lot of result and

622
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,669
it's pretty very lasting and like I said

623
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,280
there are other law enforcement agencies

624
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:27,750
that are interested in working with the

625
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,639
efcc and on that note I'd like to see

626
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:33,830
very big thank you and if there are

627
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,830
questions I will be happy to take them
