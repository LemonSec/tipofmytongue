1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,810
test there we go can hear myself

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,019
so good morning everybody thank you for
having me

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,340
here girl called Blue was inspired by

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,750
sort statement media about the purpose
of code below

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,490
and I've worked that into my keynote and
so

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,830
what has really done for me is made me
think a little bit more

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,129
about an analogy between public safety
and

8
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:35,519
network security we're going to explore
that a little bit my talk

9
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:39,089
Ross gonna talk about some other trends
big trends happening

10
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,960
in the industry so I'm not gonna get
very technical but what I want to leave

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,519
you with

12
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:49,649
are some bigger ideas and concepts and I
hope to talk to you about them

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,399
today and tomorrow so how do we get to
where we are today

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,799
without going too far back we can start
agrarian

15
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,589
period up and a really simple back then

16
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:05,610
everybody was a generalist

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,950
and then we move to industrialization
phase

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,789
which was a lot of a simple repetition

19
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:17,259
using machinery also unskilled labor

20
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,869
generally you needed skill to set up the
machines

21
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:27,869
but you generally get needs kilter run
the machines and then we moved into an

22
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,270
information age

23
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,140
and you can see the trajectory where

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,999
specializing or getting more complicated
worker skills

25
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:42,340
and education become more important
systems are becoming more

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:49,119
interconnected and more dependent on
each other so the big trend this

27
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,159
specialization

28
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,399
there's not many generalists left in
information security area

29
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,759
people specialize if they wanna stand
out in a crowd

30
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,200
you need to be an expert if you want to
advance your career

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,939
what are you an expert in static code
review dynamic code review

32
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,400
JavaScript reverse engineering d
obfuscation

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,159
you can specialize in so many things now
or twenty years ago

34
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,519
I was not the case this is the world we
live in

35
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,730
the side effect is

36
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,129
complexity economy needs

37
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,269
naturally becomes more complex the more
people specialize

38
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,810
and it gets to the point where no one
percent or small group of people

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,150
kept actually understand what's going on
its greater than any one of us to

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,650
conceive up in our mind

41
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,700
so that's where we are

42
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,610
we're moving to a more complex
environment you can see this in our

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,409
networks

44
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,090
here's an original drawing 1969

45
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,530
the very first ARPA network at 10

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,090
that was Sept

47
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,930
but you can see a

48
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,260
December it already has four notes

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,180
to a couple months it's gone to come
forceful

50
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,599
by 1975

51
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,090
arpa network is on both coasts in the
United States

52
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,140
there's even microwave links off to
London and Hawaii

53
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,120
so I think we can still keep this in our
head

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,629
I think if your system administrator you
could understand this whole

55
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,969
graphic have a good understanding of
what's going on in the network

56
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:44,959
but by 1977 here's a logical diagram

57
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,319
Scott too complicated to really put on a
map right now

58
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
now you probably can't keep it all in
your head

59
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,049
and I dare you to keep that in your head

60
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,109
so ok this is an attempt

61
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,200
by Chris Harrison to show

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,379
the size the interconnects between
countries

63
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,109
carrying Internet traffic so

64
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,329
the brighter the more dense the traffic

65
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,780
and I have a map from 2007 I have this
from 2011

66
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,220
and you can see the map is turning into
a big pile up white

67
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,320
so

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,170
things are in the language in the world
economic for this is a hyper-connected

69
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,760
world

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,230
missed too many connections bore you to
completely do any kind of link analysis

71
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,920
and it's forcing us to look at the
internet in new ways

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,490
here's Google trying to give us a new
map a map showing

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,560
popularity or traffic statistics

74
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,630
and you can sort of see there's a
universe here and a only a few

75
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,060
the largest sites are standing out but
you can zoom and zoom

76
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,300
and so it's a fun site to explore

77
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,760
you quickly realize how insignificant
your own site news

78
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,380
compared to everybody else

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,780
now if you go back to 110 years oh wait
they took that slide up

80
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,460
so if up so if that's the environment
where operating in

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,020
actors the bad actors good actors
companies operated

82
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,240
I just quickly go through four groups

83
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,920
so when we're talkin we have a common
understanding

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,550
and I'm trying to explain to
decision-makers

85
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,900
when I use the term decision-makers I
mean maybe politician this

86
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,320
I mean maybe executives people or
purchasing things

87
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,670
people are saying policies as a nation
states generally what secrets

88
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,290
and the reason for this is generally
nation-states wanna make sure you're not

89
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,210
lying to them

90
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,600
so when the United States says yes we do
covert

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,170
action X the technical term is covert
action

92
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,440
what we're really trying to do is
verified is the United States sure that

93
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,510
what North Korea is telling them

94
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,820
really what North Korea is doing is what
Iran is telling us publicly

95
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,750
really what they're doing behind the
scenes right so we're trying to verify

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,330
what people are saying generally through
nation-states

97
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,750
China find out secrets

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,030
criminals don't care about seekers right

99
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,680
hard to monetize could you sell them to

100
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,160
up generally organized criminals like
things that are very

101
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,850
fungible things they can sell quickly
credit card numbers

102
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,880
bank accounts wire transfer information

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,910
databases nation-states

104
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,390
have printing presses they can print
money

105
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,700
they don't need to steal what organized
criminals are stealing

106
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,180
generally protesters want attention and
I'm using the term protesters a little

107
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,520
lightly

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,400
but a protester might be in groups like
anonymous

109
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,790
it might need groups like Greenpeace
that's trying to dry attention to a

110
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,450
cause like

111
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,980
way leaner oil drilling

112
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,290
I might be a political protester opposed
to a certain

113
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,390
new policy but generally they'll do
things like

114
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,290
denial of service attacks deface web
sites

115
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,700
what they're trying to do is drive
attention to their cause

116
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,540
and finally we've got hackers and
security researchers

117
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,990
academics and they generally what
knowledge

118
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,990
they want to understand how does that
work work

119
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,880
what's really going on and that's you
guys in this room

120
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,760
least I hope it stops right I mean we're
here to try to understand what's really

121
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,970
going on

122
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,500
what are the risks what can I do with
the network

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,920
can I make the technology do things that
was never intended to do

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,660
and I build a new product based on
something and all the idea

125
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,920
so these are the actors now the
interesting thing

126
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,620
as only hackers and security researchers
generally discovered new classes of all

127
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,690
abilities

128
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,160
we expose core product security

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,400
and whisper public debate

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,010
so if you think a bit where sort of like
that a white blood cell

131
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,530
we're like an antibody floating around
the internet

132
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,570
identifying problems and exposing them
to the world

133
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,750
and then we hope things improve

134
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,879
so if we were not provided this function

135
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,199
if the government regulated what
security researchers could talk about

136
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:49,470
if governments regulated what academic
security people could publish

137
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,860
the public would be losing the one voice
where they can learn what's really going

138
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,019
on

139
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,660
you know what product do you buy do you
think microsoft is going to be honest

140
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,709
with you

141
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,060
or do you trust the security researchers
that have been studying Microsoft

142
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,000
Security

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,579
so this fourth group I feel is critical
for public debate

144
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:16,000
the interesting thing is criminals in
government don't do this

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,930
it's not in their interest why would
criminals tell you how they're breaking

146
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,610
into the site

147
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,819
why would a government go out of their
way to point out how poor their

148
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:32,819
regulation is arts standards aren't
being met

149
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,759
so if you think about all the actors on
the Internet

150
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,250
all horror the right now there interests
are somewhat aligned

151
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,480
you can't steal money on the internet if
the network is down

152
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,699
you can't break into a country and look
at their secrets

153
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,930
if the network is down everybody needs a
network to work

154
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,720
and so for the last two years I've been
asking audiences

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,589
think about this is there a 15 group

156
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:09,470
is their fifth group that does not need
the network to work

157
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,550
I'm really curious I can't really think
I'm a group

158
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,160
that would not want the network to
function but if you look at the amount

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,379
of problems we're having on the Internet
today

160
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:23,709
and that's one everybody needs it to
work

161
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,319
it makes me very nervous that if a group
doesn't need it to work

162
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:32,009
we're really in for some trouble

163
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:35,850
so this is my Jeff Moss invented graphic

164
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,430
have made this up and up

165
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,810
so what i did. is I would ask people
what's the largest island service

166
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,689
flow you've seen and that I would
charted

167
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,060
and my thinking is that's how big the
attack is that you need to be able to

168
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,589
absorb if you wanna stay online

169
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,470
I did this one is working and I can and
I was really concerned about to dial

170
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,089
service attacks against the root servers
on the Internet

171
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,249
but it's applicable not just to the root
servers it's applicable to your company

172
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,810
you know if in 2012 you could absorb

173
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,199
200 gigabits attack your five

174
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,819
but now it's February in 2014 you're not
fine

175
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:22,959
you can't absorb that anymore you can
only absorb 200 games

176
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,120
so if you look at the trajectory is sort
of the health of our networks

177
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,189
improving or not

178
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:34,879
the directions not good so just recently

179
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,149
the largest known to dial service attack
what said day

180
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,249
DNS reflective amplification attack
against spam house

181
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:47,509
I was last year as about 309 Gigabit

182
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:52,540
if you see this red line at the bottom
in the red dots

183
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,029
ok that should be at the 100 a 100
Gigabit line it's moved up when I resize

184
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,499
the graphic but anyway at a 100 gigabits

185
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:05,350
that's the pass a switch port you can
buy right now

186
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,110
you completely saturate a switch port
with more than a hundred gangs have

187
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,249
traffic

188
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:13,529
if that's all you've got and your call
center or your internet exchange

189
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,829
they're done so the only way you're
going to absorb more than a hundred as

190
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:19,819
you have to have more switchport

191
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,149
just last week the new largest attack
was made over 400 gigabits

192
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,050
against CloudFlare using reflective
amplification attacks

193
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,809
using night network time service

194
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,920
so how we gonna deal with these problems
well

195
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,170
we can look to the investment up

196
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,110
people when you invest they do things
they specialize

197
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,120
their money to get larger

198
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,259
returns they take more risk but you can
get your return

199
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,870
this example would be put all your money
Apple

200
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,040
Apple goes from five hundred dollars to
a thousand dollars

201
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,050
you just doubled your money but the
problem is

202
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,829
if Apple goes down to 250 you're screwed

203
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:14,490
so now what we do as we diversify

204
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,059
we reduce our returns we only own 10
percent Apple

205
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:22,410
but now I Apple goes down we've limited
are

206
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,059
exposure we get less return

207
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,790
we take less risks

208
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,290
and if you look in the future where we
leaning work what kind of a

209
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,769
problems will be facing I'm saying
they're gonna be complex the related

210
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,300
issues

211
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,850
and I say this because we're moving to
the cloud

212
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,439
and we even not just have cloudy a
virtualized clouds and clouds

213
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:52,529
and that leads us to the problem that
failure modes in complex systems

214
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:56,920
are possible to predict just like I said
earlier

215
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,470
the networks are too large for any one
group of people to fully understand the

216
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,790
network

217
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,459
failure modes our too complex for
anybody to understand

218
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:10,910
systems will fail and we may never
understand why

219
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,119
and you know what that might be okay

220
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,499
we might be able to adapt we might be
able to work around

221
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:25,470
you might be able to mitigate we may
never understand the root cause

222
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,660
here's an example these are

223
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,970
cameras used to read license plate
numbers

224
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,249
for traffic control for parking

225
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,809
fairly straightforward agreed to license
plate number and decides

226
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:42,350
after speeding and to give you a ticket
or not

227
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,350
but what do you think no wrong with this
what's wrong with this picture

228
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,300
look at that license plate

229
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,779
so little single injection license plate

230
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,059
and you can see by the reader board on
the right they're starting to drop date

231
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,990
out of tables

232
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,689
I don't think the network designers the
database designer spot of people doing

233
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,970
that to the front of the car

234
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,480
in the United States there's a lot of
license plate readers on police cars

235
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,629
and the most popular license plate
number is

236
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,149
X axe X xxx

237
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:32,149
because that's what a chain link fence
looks like 20 camera reader

238
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:38,769
so I really like what code blue press
release had to say

239
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,009
and I will focus on this last little
part they named we name the conference

240
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,499
after the cold because we hope to save
the world by combining

241
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:51,209
people's knowledge I think really this
is the only way we're going to move

242
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,100
forward

243
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,230
groups have communities working loosely
together

244
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,230
toward the same hands

245
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,600
too large for all this to coordinate

246
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,360
but we all have similar interests we all
want the network to function

247
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,230
so what we're gonna have to do is
already ourselves

248
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,619
and move in a loosely coupled direction

249
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,410
toward improving network health

250
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,869
and I really like this public health
analogy because it allows us to have a

251
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,550
new conversation with

252
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,470
with decision-makers like no doctor

253
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,790
thinks they're going to cure cancer

254
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,079
if you go into medicine and you say I'm
going to cure cancer

255
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,559
people gonna laugh at you we understand
cancers too complicated

256
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,129
there's too many causes it's not healthy

257
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,220
to tell yourself you're gonna cop cure
cancer

258
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,019
you're going to be disappointed and we
don't necessarily

259
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,589
sure diseases anymore we manage diseases

260
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,839
we mitigate them we reduce their fax

261
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,509
down to such a slow percentage of the
population

262
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:03,089
that diseases are no longer life
threatening

263
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,170
sounds like what we need to do with
risks on the Internet

264
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,740
and it's also possible to be re in fact
me how many people a patch their system

265
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,120
just to find out the new patch is viable

266
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,320
to a previous exploit this is

267
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,930
this is just the way things work the
medical field

268
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,290
so I think the analogy is lined up
really well

269
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,390
not perfect but allows us to now have a
conversation with a new group of people

270
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,600
that maybe they don't understand

271
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,950
firewalls but maybe they understand

272
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,080
cancer despite me a good way to talk to

273
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,700
up politicians and decision-makers

274
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,740
I think it's really healthy and they are
going to that for a little bit

275
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,690
here's the old way of thinking right
predator defense

276
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,710
you've got high walls you've got a big
blow

277
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,400
permitted defense and when you talked
about pressure defense you generally

278
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,300
talk to your

279
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,480
Security Department and your IT
department

280
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,700
maybe a top tier application teams to
let them understand what kinda by

281
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,070
network environment there

282
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,270
so the problem is out there

283
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,360
it's at the border and you're dealing
with a small number of teams

284
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,310
and if something goes wrong it's sort of
a disaster for the patient or the

285
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:33,360
company

286
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,830
ok perhaps by the new way of thinking

287
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:42,510
is the Trojan horse there are already
inside our network

288
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,800
you have to assume the bad guys are
inside your network you're already

289
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,850
compromised

290
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,220
okay now when you gonna do about it you
might have already been exposed to that

291
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,290
disease

292
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,740
you might have already been around a
carrier cold

293
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,060
what you gonna do about it well now we
get to have a much more healthy

294
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,600
discussion now we have to talk to our
legal department

295
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,930
what we gonna do if we get compromised

296
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,680
are we gonna call the police are we
gonna sue the people who've attacked us

297
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,100
are we going to try to enforce contracts

298
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,270
what we gonna tell the world we need to
get our communications department

299
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,070
involved

300
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,250
are we gonna tell the world what
happened to us I we're gonna pretend it

301
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,480
didn't happen

302
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
risk management what do we need to
protect now

303
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,250
cuz they're inside and if they're inside

304
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:40,170
and we can't protect everything we need
to decide what we're gonna protect

305
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,330
we need to involve finance this is a
limited amount of money we can involve

306
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,860
protecting ourselves

307
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,720
so on and so forth so you can see what
would you rather have

308
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,850
a company that has had this kind of
discussion

309
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,610
involving all these departments or would
you rather work at a company

310
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,390
but only had this kind of discussion

311
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:06,610
if I was leaving the security team up a
company I want to work here

312
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,500
this is where I could have the most
impact and where the company has the

313
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,910
greatest chance of having good health

314
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,340
so its 2014

315
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,050
you still can't send email securely
today

316
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,950
you can't have a secure phone call
conversation today

317
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,110
it's essentially impossible to browse
the web

318
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,500
and name resolution is essentially in
secure

319
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,280
it's getting better with TNS sec but
essentially in a secure

320
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,110
why is this

321
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,520
this is the way it's been for 20 years

322
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,850
15-20 years as a community

323
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,030
why can't we move forward

324
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,370
think about all the technology in the
billions tens and hundreds of billions

325
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,500
of dollars we've spent

326
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,100
networks mobile phones gaming platforms

327
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,150
medical systems we've invented whole
industries

328
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,180
still can't send email securely still
can't have a secure phone call

329
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,470
what's going on

330
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,370
so when people used to ask me this
question I had a nice answer for them

331
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,410
and it went something like this: in the
nineteen nineties

332
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,060
we thought but consumer selection

333
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,100
would be the solution

334
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,160
market forces would drive people toward
better products

335
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,140
how many people here remember the
advertisement if you want a safe car

336
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,710
you buy a Volvo right

337
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,120
everybody knows that you buy Volvo
somehow Volvo convinced us that you need

338
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,610
to buy their product if you wanna be
safe

339
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,630
the problem is consumer selection
doesn't work

340
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,480
by a product security features is too
complicated

341
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
mean how are you gonna make an informed
decision

342
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,580
lines of code number as perhaps
statements

343
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,640
reverse analysis cool who's gonna make
an informed decision on the best product

344
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,510
excess it's a specialized decision that
needs to be made by

345
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,910
experts not general market force

346
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,350
so the market failed us

347
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,300
people buy products based on number
features they didn't buy them based on

348
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,790
how secure they were

349
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,530
but OK doesn't matter fact that work

350
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,590
we've got some other options

351
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,500
so and the 2000's we believe insurance
would save the day

352
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,600
that's okay insurance premiums will
force companies to act

353
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,350
more rationally insurance will make sure
that companies by secure products

354
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,770
a bigass care products they have less
problems their insurance rates go down

355
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,810
market forces will save us again

356
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,970
accepted the problem here is

357
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,490
there's no standards for creating data

358
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,130
there's no national breach notification
law how to insurance companies collect

359
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,960
statistics

360
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,410
to build actuarial tables every report
you read online

361
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,180
has a different number how much
intellectual property has been stolen

362
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,450
every report has a different statistical
how many times accompanies minute act

363
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,050
there's no good data if you wanna health
insurance companies

364
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,750
you need to help create good data
otherwise the insurance market

365
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,150
is gonna fail us but that's okay

366
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,410
because now it's the 21 hundreds our
2010

367
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,490
us and we've got governments that will
regulate for us

368
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,580
the government will save the day

369
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,080
the market can save us insurance
companies can save us governments will

370
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,030
save us

371
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,230
and this is a big question right now

372
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,070
government even know what to do

373
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,210
and when I talk to government they're
very reluctant they don't want to harm

374
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,920
innovation

375
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,590
they don't want to do anything to slow
down technical advancement

376
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,200
and companies tell them don't regulate
us

377
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,440
where Facebook where Microsoft don't
regulate us

378
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,630
or else competition will be harmed we
won't be as quick

379
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:35,620
we won't create as many jobs and because
of that

380
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,500
very few things are regulated privacy
regulations

381
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:45,230
networks do you even have to report if
your networks broken into

382
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,580
so we're sort of in this period where
government I really doing it

383
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,220
markets are doing it and insurance isn't
doing it

384
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,670
that leaves us I mean it's really down
to us now

385
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,460
and this is some both exciting and
depressing

386
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,270
when I think about it is this the state
were really here

387
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,170
it's up to us to provide the leadership
to decision-makers

388
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,670
if governments are going to regulate
they're gonna turn to experts like us

389
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,680
to tell them what's possible and what's
not possible

390
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,340
we need to be able to speak to that in
terms they understand

391
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,550
and we need to help companies understand
do the right thing with their networks

392
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,160
companies need to understand they're not
island in the sea

393
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,560
their hyper-connected and if they have
bad network health

394
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,670
their neighbors around the mall have bad
network Al

395
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,710
song and Ron to this analogy

396
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,760
going back to the medical a public
safety

397
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,680
same first do no harm

398
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,580
and sometimes it probably it could be
better to not do something

399
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,560
or do nothing at all than it is to do
something

400
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,630
and cause more harm than good

401
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,440
so think that when you're working on
your network sometimes it may be better

402
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,350
not to do something it's better to not
roll out that risky new service without

403
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,880
testing

404
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,590
so for me I tried to interpret this I
have a couple of ideas

405
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,450
first do no harm to the trusted that
users

406
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,490
you need to be open about your policies

407
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,840
you need to explain what the
expectations are when you're on my

408
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,460
network

409
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,770
I'm going to monitor your behavior to
make sure you're not infected

410
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,480
okay the user's understand now

411
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,580
understand the rules if you never tell
the user's the rules

412
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,480
you're going to make some they're gonna
be distrustful

413
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,210
and we gonna be resentful way to change
the rules on them

414
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,970
without telling them you need to be
honest about the risks of technology

415
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,740
and this is going to be difficult
because you might need to speak truth to

416
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,760
power

417
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,130
you might need it to have to tell your
boss you know what

418
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,190
that's really risky are you willing to
take that risk

419
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,950
but you need to be honest about the
risks of new technologies

420
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,820
I'm not saying don't deploy new
technologies I'm just saying

421
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:30,230
open your eyes make sure those on your
team understand the risks

422
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,910
and assume the risks I don't care if you
take risks

423
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,610
I get concerned if you take risks any
don't know you're doing

424
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,900
and so don't let wishful thinking
influence your decisions

425
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,040
I mean we've all been to the doctor

426
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,810
they're pretty honest with you they're
not like sure no problem

427
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,290
ok they'll tell you every little risk
that you could be facing

428
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,850
every drug interaction you may have they
want you to be a fully informed patient

429
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,410
understand the risks and the procedures

430
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,490
so this is brought me to the thinking

431
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:15,610
up community immunity this also is that
there is called herd immunity

432
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,790
it's a it's a they're used and
vaccinating populations

433
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,930
and you get a certain amount of
community immunity

434
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,280
when a significant portion of the
population has a major

435
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,870
protection so we're gonna go through a
couple slides

436
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,800
on this

437
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,510
so there's three modes have immunity a
community immunity

438
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:47,110
in the first mode nobody is vaccinated
nobody has any protection

439
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,290
and you can see over time this is the
worst situation you can be a

440
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:57,290
almost the entire population becomes
infected

441
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,120
in the second load we have a some of the
population

442
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,630
the yellow characters are vaccinated

443
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,640
and you can see this reduces the
transmission

444
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,480
slightly and the population

445
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,400
so you get some benefit some portion of
the population

446
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,510
is vaccinated now the third mode

447
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,830
is the most important this is in most of
the population is vaccinated

448
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,650
you can see between the two once most of
the population is vaccinated

449
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:40,650
even those that are not vaccinated get a
benefit

450
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,700
so neither statistics this will tell you
how much of your population

451
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,790
actually needs to be vaccinated for you

452
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,420
to get a conferred immunity

453
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,790
so when I was looking at this i was
thinkin

454
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,530
the it does this apply in the Internet
does this apply networked

455
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,720
world

456
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,960
how would I applied this okay so here
are three modes

457
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,960
a community and here's jeff the network
security guy thinking about the problem

458
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,110
what would I do well

459
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:26,590
in the first node networks and systems
are not maintained

460
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,590
power spread to the networks without
notice

461
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,110
nobody's monitoring anything and there's
little to stop

462
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,090
the spread of days that analogy works

463
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:42,280
it's probably a corollary there

464
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,470
the second one some systems and networks
are not maintain

465
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,080
flowers sometimes noticed probably
noticed by big companies

466
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,430
companies a security teams maybe some
government agencies

467
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,400
academics and the malware spreads
through

468
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,570
some the population and finally

469
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,900
where we would want to be

470
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,800
is most networks and systems are
maintained malwares noticed

471
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,100
almost immediately it's removed

472
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,280
actions are taken taken to not only
protect the network

473
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,040
but those networks around them this
would be the conferred immunity stage

474
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,920
and a network analogy

475
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,670
and right now I think where somewhere
between one and two

476
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,970
I think the the movement is toward more
toward to

477
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,100
maybe two in a little bit of three

478
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,620
I don't think we can ever get to the
third molar without government

479
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,690
regulation

480
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,440
I hate saying that because I don't like
government regulation

481
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,880
but after twenty years there's a reason
why we're not at three

482
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,660
we haven't gotten to three in 20 years
by ourselves

483
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,330
I bet you were not going to get to three
unless we have regulation

484
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:07,300
so that means that regulation has been
going to be very important

485
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,670
so that makes me think right can a
firewall act

486
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,630
as a vaccination are their technical
things we can do on our networks

487
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,950
to sort of vaccinate ourselves and
others

488
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:24,950
or is this gonna break down it's not
gonna work

489
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,490
there's been a little bit of study in
this area but not much

490
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,940
there's a white paper called internet
bad neighborhoods

491
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,429
that was really looking at the network
to see if they were bad neighborhoods

492
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:40,980
in the Internet not what happens if a
good network

493
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,370
is interconnected with the bad network
so I think appear researcher

494
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,370
there's a lot love unique work can be
done here

495
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,570
so

496
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,669
if you want to be in the first group the
first known

497
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:59,740
that's the nineteen immunized group

498
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:06,480
just don't do anything just sit back
have coffee you don't go out of their

499
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
way to monitor your system's

500
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,259
you don't do anything to protect your
networks you don't step on patches

501
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,309
I generally think this is the home user

502
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:21,990
unless the system operating system OS X
for your antivirus program does

503
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,360
something nothing will get done

504
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,590
there's actually a passive user the
network

505
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,899
and there's some advantages to this

506
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:37,809
it's really cheap the least expensive
option and it requires the least amount

507
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,590
of skill

508
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:43,129
it just happens the problem is

509
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:48,019
you're part of the problem you're making
the Internet worse place for others

510
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,159
and increasingly there may be legal

511
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,649
consequences for example in some
countries

512
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:58,220
if you have a wife open WiFi access
hotspot

513
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,029
without a password and somebody uses
your hotspot

514
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:05,200
commit a crime you can be held
personally liable

515
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,899
you're supposed to apply password your
hotspot

516
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,560
and you did and you made the internet
worse so

517
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,510
as we look at regulation in the future
don't be surprised if this

518
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,869
first option becomes more and more risky

519
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:27,869
you can't just claim I didn't know the
second mode

520
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,460
it was the protect only yourself I call
is partially

521
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,829
immunized and what this means is you're
only protecting your networks in your

522
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:36,639
system's

523
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,730
you're not really doing anything to help
anybody else examples would be things

524
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,270
like

525
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,310
impaction update your system as you stay
on top of

526
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:51,560
buying the best software are you like
spelter

527
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,669
filter spoofed traffic inbound your
networks

528
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:58,050
so you might filter like artsy

529
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,770
1918 address space but jacques building
on the outbound

530
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:07,470
you might enable DNS second allegation
on your name servers

531
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,250
so your users are getting dancers

532
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,520
but you don't sign your own zones so

533
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,660
others are not getting good answers from
you only your users are getting good

534
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,740
answers from others

535
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,119
you may check sender policy framework

536
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,750
or SPF records to try to limit the
amount of spam

537
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,260
your network is receiving but on the
other hand

538
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,349
you don't publish SPF record to tell the
rest of the world again

539
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,369
you're getting the benefit but you're
not helping others get a benefit

540
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:45,770
the advantages here are

541
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,290
it's a lower cost than being fully
immunized

542
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,680
the changes are not as complex as being
fully immunized

543
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,880
and you're in a better

544
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,460
posture you're in a better position to
protect your networks but there's a

545
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,400
higher management configuration cost

546
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,410
your administrators have to be more
skillful

547
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,050
if you doing this yourself at home you
just have to have more knowledge

548
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,540
and finally we're in the fully immunized
state here

549
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:20,510
this is like the ideal this is where you
go out of their way to help others

550
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:27,510
you don't have to but you do this would
be a lot like the second one but now

551
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,950
you're also filtering

552
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,540
outbound traffic and this would be using
something filtering something called BC

553
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,339
p38

554
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:37,660
addresses PCP 84 address space

555
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,839
up artsy 1918 addresses

556
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:44,079
if you look at how denial of service
attacks happen on the net

557
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,099
a lot a minister spoof traffic a large
portion of harm

558
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,970
on the Internet can be reduced it can be
managed

559
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:59,030
if everybody was filtering spoke to
traffic

560
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,079
you DNS excite your zone

561
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,900
you might disable recursion on your name
server: so people don't use it an

562
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,010
amplification attacks

563
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,130
you would also make sure feared time
server not anybody can query maybe your

564
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,099
time service

565
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:20,280
see your time server can't be used in an
attack like we just saw last week

566
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,589
you can see the difference you're doing
things that are helping

567
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:27,400
others

568
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,160
and this is where I believe the network
gets a conferred Muni

569
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,119
all in this third state does the network
start getting better around you

570
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,569
its most beneficial to the largest
number people on the internet

571
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,200
it's the best security for yourself and
others

572
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,500
its most expensive requires most skill

573
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,810
and I don't think we're going to get
here without regulation

574
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,780
but in the medical field there's
regulation

575
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,530
he saw function medical system public
health around the world improving

576
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,579
maybe there's a something to be learned
there

577
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,140
for example if you look at TNS sec

578
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,210
around the world here's a map of all the
country codes in the world and whether

579
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,339
or not

580
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:20,040
they're ready to receive DNS exciting
zones

581
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,079
this is January of 2014

582
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,799
if you look at this map the vast
majority of all internet users on the

583
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,799
planet

584
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:31,819
can use DNS sec

585
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,920
so we're in a chicken and egg situation

586
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,990
the network is ready for DNS sack

587
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:44,410
but nobody's really adopting why is that

588
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,920
to chicken-and-egg situation freed in a
sec to be useful

589
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,760
people need to sign their zones nobody
wants to sign their songs

590
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,760
until I know it'll give them a better

591
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,140
so were in a stalemate right now

592
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,790
and you see the same thing happening
with ipv6

593
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,869
why would I deploy ipv6 nobody's using
it

594
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:10,920
well pretty soon will be parts of the
world the will

595
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,359
only be reachable over ipv6 and then
market forces

596
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,400
her market forces well hopefully force
people to upgrade

597
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,950
their networks

598
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,690
so what if you don't owner-operated
network what if you're not

599
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,660
accompany with the big Riis p

600
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,920
well I'm not going to go into a lot of
detail but i just want to give you some

601
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,420
ideas

602
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,460
donate your resources

603
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,180
this is the idea of you donate blood

604
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,430
to help others why don't you donate some

605
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:53,599
Internet resources so I've got a couple
examples

606
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,710
let's say you want to help a political
activists reporters

607
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,339
other people increase their privacy and
security around the world

608
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:04,700
well you could donate some other CPU and
some other band with the run

609
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:10,060
a tornado you can just set it to use a
little bit if your bandwidth

610
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,549
what really impact your network and
you're making the overall internet

611
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:19,510
a safer place for people to browse
securely using tor

612
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,440
but you can be part of the solution and
all you have to do is turn it on

613
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,310
updated once in a while

614
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,940
maybe wanna help gather that data maybe
you wanna help

615
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,240
instrument the Internet and help
everybody

616
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,079
not just researchers understand

617
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,119
the current state the world current
state of the internet

618
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,290
well right in Europe will give you
what's called Atlas probe

619
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,900
for free you plug this atlas probe

620
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,230
and your network at home or in your
company and now it's part of over 4,900

621
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,099
or 4800 probes around the world

622
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,599
measuring the Internet and academics can
now go to ripe

623
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,430
and they could submit jobs they could
say they can ask questions like

624
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,190
I wonder if i can suppose traffic out of
Europe

625
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,880
I wonder how many countries are not
reachable in China

626
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,540
I wonder if anybody's name server in
Europe is telling lies

627
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,540
well now we can ok we can use the right
Atlas network-

628
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,880
and ask questions from anywhere on the
planet

629
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,580
you can help out by plugging in a free
probe donating to bed

630
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,589
right you can help be a researcher

631
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:43,260
whether you understand it or not or
maybe you really do want to help cure

632
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,779
cancer

633
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:48,890
the folding at home despite repeated
computing project

634
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,220
uses some other band what to help hold

635
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,650
proteins through a simulation

636
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,839
after folding proteins up

637
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,000
new novel drugs and cures could possibly
be discovered

638
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,029
so you're donating your CPU type this is
something that's so needed

639
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:12,480
with the PlayStation 3 by default they
installed the phone at home project

640
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,700
so if they weren't playing games you
might be helping the planet

641
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,020
and these are just three quick examples
if you really want to help out I'm sure

642
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,349
this rumor people can find ways to
donate resources to make the world

643
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:29,480
better

644
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,170
now my community immunity analogy

645
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,430
breaks down a little bit because you're
talking about diseases

646
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,580
we're talking about one community humans

647
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,290
but what we're talking about communities
online we're talking about different

648
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,779
populations

649
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:52,240
we're talking about companies that
behave differently than governments

650
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,490
the PA different than individuals

651
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,089
and so I think from I tell you to really
work I would have to look at

652
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,299
each one of these populations and I
would have to say

653
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:05,569
if you are a company what could you do

654
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:09,500
if your government what could you do and
then I would start

655
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,609
telling each population how they could
make a difference

656
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:17,430
how they could get a conferred immunity
how they can help out

657
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:23,540
but so far I'm really liking the
direction of this

658
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,960
so finally I want you to all think about
the future

659
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,839
you're gonna be listening to a lot of
talks here that are very cutting edge

660
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:35,130
very technical gonna be exposing
vulnerabilities in a certain class of

661
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,790
products are certain piece of software

662
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,140
and I want you to think about the big
picture I want you to think about the

663
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,609
future

664
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,560
part in the future is next generation
technologies

665
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,790
for the first time in 20 years the
Internet is essentially

666
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,240
getting an upgrade the way we used to
use the Internet

667
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,930
and the way we're going to use the
internet ten years from now different

668
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,380
if you look at the future it's going to
be DN a sec

669
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,599
maybe not this year maybe not next year

670
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,180
but within 45 years we will be using DNS
sec

671
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,290
because it's safer and

672
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,609
and allows companies to build new
products

673
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:22,579
so for example in a sec allows you to
ask a question a DNS

674
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,299
and you get an answer back and you can
trust that answer

675
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:29,920
you can trust that IP address for the
web server

676
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,990
but what I asked him as a different
question

677
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,579
what I'm not asking for the IP address
of Google

678
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:40,579
what I'm asking for a picture of a cat

679
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm asking for a recipe

680
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,790
what I'm asking for digital certificate
our music file

681
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:52,869
for the first time you'll be able to ask
a question

682
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:56,210
and trust the answer

683
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:00,089
and I think that's gonna enable a huge
new class and products that we haven't

684
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:00,410
even

685
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,260
fatah your and once people start
building those products

686
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,920
and using DNS sec the market will take
over

687
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,940
the first killer app for DNS act right
now

688
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,910
is considered a and what you do with
Danish you publish your own SSL

689
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,880
certificate

690
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,770
and so icing not to you with Dane I say

691
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,470
you wanna come to my website using SSL

692
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,279
okay only trust my website if it's this
SSL certificate

693
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:35,500
if the fingerprint on the SSL
certificate is in my DNS

694
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,109
trusted if the fingerprint doesn't match
then it's a man-in-the-middle attack

695
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:43,540
or some BS faking my SSL certificate

696
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,060
or certificate authority has been
compromised

697
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,450
well in the future you get trusted jodie

698
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,480
you get to change your SSL cert whenever
you want immediately

699
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,859
you don't have to count a certificate
authority you control your destiny

700
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:03,490
and that's going to be done through the
day and you RTC

701
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,950
mail servers postfix supporting Dane

702
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,069
new web browsers I think ron is
supporting day and there's a plugin for

703
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,839
firefox

704
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,589
so several years from now everything
will speak today

705
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:22,029
and we will start to mitigate and manage
the harm that can be done by rogue CA's

706
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,410
we're also gonna move into an ipv6 world

707
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,920
now maybe not all that interesting to
security researchers

708
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,549
but the one thing it does do is it helps
us with attribution

709
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:38,589
one of the big problems with ipv4 right
now

710
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:42,569
is since we've run out of address space
we're sticking everything behind

711
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:46,260
network address translation devices or
even worse carrier-grade

712
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,420
thats and it makes it almost impossible
for law enforcement to figure out

713
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,089
who really attacks you it's a lot of

714
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:59,140
looking for logs to figure it out in the
future no more carrier-grade that

715
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:04,540
hopefully it'll just be ipv6 which will
help with better attribution

716
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,710
I'll give us unlimited growth animal
label a whole new class

717
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,160
love products the wall re inspired the

718
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,109
the Internet of Things already inspired
the marketplace for innovation

719
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,569
so Internet is changing

720
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:24,819
ten years from now I hope to give the
speech I hope to be able to say

721
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:29,569
you can send email securely you can
browse the web securely

722
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:35,920
because of technology such as Dana DNS
sec

723
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,859
so I'm gonna leave you with this thought
I want you to talk to me at the

724
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:40,890
reception

725
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,510
later today has thinking about Internet
Security

726
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,180
in a public health contacts been useful

727
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,329
is gonna help you when you talk to your
management

728
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:55,319
is gonna help us as a community we have
to go explain the government's

729
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:00,470
companies what we're trying to do I hope
it helps you sleep better at night

730
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:03,690
because we're not convincing ourselves
we have to solve a hundred percent of

731
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,609
the problem

732
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:10,109
we have to cure cancer now we just have
to work at curing cancer

733
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:14,540
tell with that are thank you very much
and welcome you to code blue

734
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,540
thank you the

735
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,440
not sure if you have chided questions
were done a time

736
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,060
now where at a time okay so I'm gonna be
around all day today and tomorrow

737
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,060
and i'm happy to talk to anyone if you
thank you very much
