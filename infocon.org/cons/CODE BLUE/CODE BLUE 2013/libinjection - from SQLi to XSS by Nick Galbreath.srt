1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,330
barrio great

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,130
higher on

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,130
my name's Nick Cobra no on here

4
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,300
other ago great the Cobra hours

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,990
with Twitter on this one announce the

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,400
actually form a new company based on
some stuff he'll be here in

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,000
but thanks to my former employees I open
web in

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,680
Tokyo and Moscow and at sea before me
these slides are also in English and

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,690
Japanese their online

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,370
right now so you can follow along

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,519
now or code blue will also post later

12
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:57,730
excuse me

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,079
it's a cenar con a slide no

14
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,229
on them this lies are available lot

15
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,899
this lies are not available in Japanese
injection attacks

16
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,700
Ahmed still a number one a loss problem

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,520
and these are very easy problems

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,630
this is unlike go wit Jeff Moss said
yesterday

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,250
this is not curing cancer these are very
easy problems

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,520
yet we still have a lot of problems

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,050
so we really need some other type of
solution so what is live injection

22
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,050
on to small C library

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,179
to tact sequel injection from user input

24
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:44,280
such as a web site or other application

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,810
it has an API in Python

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,780
PHP lou are and I think there's one for
Emery B

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,160
Anders introduced about two years ago at
Black Cat

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,530
ca Tom again it's available now

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,580
its open source its on

30
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,599
get home for you to use right now

31
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,700
why

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,490
I two years ago when I was looking for
solutions

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,890
about there just weren't very many
available

34
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,060
on the existing Mac moves

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,690
the existing systems to detect sequin
jack shit are all based on regular

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,700
expressions

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,590
they didn't have any tests in terms of
performance

38
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,200
I how fast it was where they

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,650
accurate did they work well I actually

40
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,830
didn't know what they were doing and
very difficult to debug

41
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:49,830
right

42
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,370
okay so today I

43
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,350
its after two years Sun version 3.9 .1

44
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,390
now we have over 8,000 unique Sourav

45
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,250
sequel I signatures over 400 unit tests

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,670
and we got over 85,000 samples have
actual sequel injection

47
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,140
collected from all sorts of people also
tough test and applications

48
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,510
and down right now it's in use at a
number of places

49
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,860
turn mod security right now the while on
the iron by: of

50
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,870
a couple of honeypots some can

51
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,400
commercial laughs on I

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,720
cannot focus on the who's here

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,590
i think is work on a job apart and there
also is a dotnet

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,310
rapper so it's being used quite a bit
arms not perfect but it's certainly a

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,030
good start

56
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,690
so now let's talk about excess

57
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,690
which has served the other injection and
someone is

58
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,299
very similar to seek well I there is no
good detection system

59
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,459
no standard library again not very many
tasks

60
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,390
and are again

61
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,500
the ones that exist are regular
expression based that

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,570
is a problem due to false positives and
false negatives

63
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,270
great

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,570
if we look at XSS

65
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,449
there are really two types there's

66
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,360
JavaScript injection attacks and their

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,380
HTML attacks if you

68
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,310
work with XSS there's a whole bunch a
different sort of names for these but

69
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,520
for detection

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,520
two types great so

71
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,970
first-run is you know cross-site
scripting JavaScript injection

72
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,240
this is your Dom style attack

73
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,800
right it attacks

74
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,470
exist in JavaScript code in your
application

75
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,520
and

76
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,020
it my opinion that this can really only
be detected

77
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,760
in the browser sometimes is a tax

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,500
never even touched the server on

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,500
and attacked in these is really hard

80
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,830
on HTML injection is the other type

81
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,710
and here on the really attacks against
that

82
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,920
token is Asian algorithm tokenization is

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,270
turning taxed into tags: X

84
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,850
not a very common word I don't know if
that translates well or not

85
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,130
and

86
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,960
this the goal this is did trick

87
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,870
the browser into changing into
JavaScript mode

88
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,480
so you can run whatever code you want
this actually seems detectable

89
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,580
and here

90
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,420
maybe easier for me over here these are
to serve samples 0

91
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,430
if you're familiar with you know
cross-eyed script in these are

92
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,130
where a you know where the user input
gets inserted

93
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,350
to create the injection attack and can
be in many

94
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,920
places you can just be emitted right
into the HTML

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,680
a might be part in the tag attribute

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,680
tag attribute value can be inserted
their

97
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,530
inside quoted characters and then also

98
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,970
only and I E you can do back quotes

99
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,900
as well so meaning

100
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,900
HTML injection concurrent many serve
different areas

101
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,840
hopes

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,979
great aka so I'll a long time ago

103
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,879
%uh every browser had their own
algorithm

104
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,990
to sort of turn text in the tags

105
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,539
I and this led to all sorts a different
tax in 01

106
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,169
for Firefox one for IE et cetera et
cetera

107
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,490
actually all did it differently however

108
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,610
at nowadays every current browser

109
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,629
actually does this exactly the same way

110
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,099
that's great for web developers and
that's great for us

111
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,180
right the html5

112
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,180
a algorithm for tokenization

113
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,039
is very specific camp um

114
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,219
you don't really need to translate all
this but

115
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:04,629
literally every step in the pars in
oliver them is very defined

116
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,319
comment start comments star with a dash
to deliver

117
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,689
all these different things and thats all
available for everyone to read

118
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,199
and inside each one things are

119
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,509
or a really clear you know

120
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,770
if it's this character do this if it
this character do that

121
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,900
if we don't know how do something else
really clear

122
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,969
and every browser now follows this
algorithm

123
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:36,640
great

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,589
arm so right now the for desktop
browsers

125
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,959
around sixty percent use this algorithm

126
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,570
right the in for IE it started in
version 9

127
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,190
upward and all the latest versions of
Chrome and Firefox have done it for a

128
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,149
very long time

129
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:02,709
likewise for mobile mobil's newer

130
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,980
over ninety percent or html5

131
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,980
thats great news so

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,230
up

133
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,279
ups excuse me the roster

134
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
mom the rest to the troublemakers are I
E six

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,779
I E seven and ie8 I E six

136
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,160
someday will die hopefully right

137
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,199
it has two occur down

138
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,720
I E seven really tiny so

139
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,980
don't worry about that an

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,600
I E atheism bit have a problem it's

141
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,699
till used a good bit 20 percent

142
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,779
Tom mostly however on Windows XP

143
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,040
so we're hoping in

144
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,060
that usage in Window XP

145
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,670
goes down I'm not convinced we should
focus our energy

146
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:09,740
on protecting users on Windows XP I'm
not sure you can do it anymore

147
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,740
so

148
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,399
given this the when introduce

149
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,399
live injection X SS and

150
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,850
one problem I saw an old version old

151
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,440
systems of detecting cross-site
scripting is

152
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
the weren't focused so are they didn't
have a

153
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,790
clear goal my goal is too packed

154
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,560
HTML injection attacks on new browsers

155
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,910
I do not care about XML

156
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,050
XLT injection different problem
important but

157
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,850
different problem I i don't care about
ie6

158
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,970
and Dom style attacks are just different

159
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,699
and there's a lot of good innovation and
protecting the client

160
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,390
Chrome and IE both have interesting
systems

161
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,519
but not today

162
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,410
I but lived injection

163
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,190
has a complete html5 tokenizer

164
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,790
now unlike a browser

165
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,380
it does not tryin bill a tree

166
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,579
or a DOM or anything like that

167
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,709
it just tries to admit token events and
I'll

168
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,899
show what that is in a moment also know

169
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:44,899
cop enough data very very fast okay so
here's

170
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,980
here's a sample avoid so the output of
this

171
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,310
tokenization step looks like you know up
top you have service that pag that comes

172
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,920
in

173
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,779
and outcomes these little things like
this

174
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,880
you know in that's I think if you've
worked with HTML your you understand

175
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,319
this

176
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:08,009
what it does so emits all the different
pieces of the input

177
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,420
now most

178
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,639
user input if it's not HTML da like this
from your web page or website

179
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,709
please enter your name most the time

180
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,970
its gonna admit nothing just one big
blob because it's not actually edged him

181
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,449
out

182
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:30,779
right so

183
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:34,850
I'm going to take user input run it
through the tokenizer

184
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,149
six different times because

185
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,970
that's how user input can be injected in
HTML pages

186
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,970
right

187
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,800
rubs there we go and then wanna have
this list I've

188
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,430
tokens I can actually banned things that
look bad

189
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,510
an obviously things that are script tag
is coming in

190
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:12,190
yes 18 Banos right away I found enough
problems with anything

191
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,960
X amount like or SVG like just to
recommend

192
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,550
banning those elements to on

193
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,840
the classic sort of like on

194
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,890
star Wildcat on time

195
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,510
the tributes for JavaScript the on blank

196
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,150
things ban those your owls that

197
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:38,690
are JavaScript ban those two and the
idea is this is much less

198
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,930
false-positive because you're your

199
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,800
you're using the structure HTML to
detect thanks

200
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,190
like on an error by itself won't

201
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,270
be banned it has to be part of a tag and
a system

202
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,200
to to work okay

203
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,510
so right the algorithm

204
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,640
how do I show that it works or doesn't
work so

205
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,460
training data

206
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,460
okay first thing I looked at as XML

207
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,670
up to use me access cheat sheets which
is our number I love

208
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,820
and fortunately the few that I found are
very old

209
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,870
they haven't been updated a was sad to
say

210
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,900
some just don't work anymore so

211
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,880
I removed all the old ones that were
kinda junk on

212
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,190
on C then a

213
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,140
yet so get rid of all the old ones keep
only the ones that actually stole work

214
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,990
I if you're not permitted html5 sack dot
org it's a really good website

215
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,410
Tom it lists every type

216
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,480
love XSS vulnerability analysts

217
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,250
what browser it's for so it's very good
resource

218
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,200
but also has a lot of very old exploits

219
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,830
great for history not so good for
training

220
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,240
and

221
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,130
this gentlemen on whose

222
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,670
Twitter handle I cannot pronounce um he

223
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,430
regularly produces really good

224
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,200
XSS they've never seen before very
regularly

225
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,980
and he's published a few documents on
excess acid are really great resources

226
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,730
so I've integrated his

227
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,730
work as well

228
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,760
notes hopes or

229
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,220
sorry there on and then I took

230
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,200
one attack scanner on

231
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,010
something you pointed a website to find
vulnerabilities

232
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,310
and took its output to see how

233
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,440
it tests for cross-site scripting and
captured that and put it in our tests we

234
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,400
the mod security

235
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,610
team also gave me

236
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,770
part of the Shazam database fuzz
database

237
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,320
also very interesting resource it

238
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,860
tries to find bugs in the

239
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,890
HTML the parsing algorithm

240
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,360
it's worth looking at if you have a
moment

241
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,750
okay

242
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:53,750
so what's the current status here
tombaugh for SIDS available now

243
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,240
its on get hard again I

244
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,070
I didn't mention before but the homepage
your website %uh vlive injection is here

245
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,050
its in the mainline you can use this
right now

246
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,510
it is early though Tom

247
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:16,000
I did run it through so I collected all
the sources and I got about 1600

248
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,310
unique access a samples and I run it
through and I get

249
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,380
almost everyone detected and I got 11 1
dats

250
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,780
not detecting and I'm very pleased to
say

251
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,140
that these only are 4-1-1

252
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,100
particular problem which I am
researching now and how to fix

253
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,110
I on balance quotes

254
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,420
mmm hard to say in japanese: I my friend
couldn't quite figure it out

255
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,420
a incorrectly formed HTML

256
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,680
attributes when they have different
quote characters inside each other

257
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,570
I E processes on very differently

258
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,530
and I'm working on on fixing that aka

259
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,650
so

260
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,350
pars in all this work and doing it six
times song slow

261
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,490
the good news is it's not

262
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,180
for most imports very little work is
actually done

263
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,660
and on my laptop

264
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm getting over 500,000 checks per
second so it's definitely fast enough

265
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,430
you won't even notice this

266
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:37,060
you know you integrate this in your
website the other thing is algorithm is

267
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,130
'em actually pretty simple the source
code

268
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,390
isn't see bite if you are

269
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,590
counted in program and I think you could
part it directly to another language

270
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:55,590
and it would still be very fast

271
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,550
okay okay so what's left on

272
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,590
it's still early my experience before

273
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,070
says because it early there'll be

274
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,920
incredible failures are bypasses you'll
find them

275
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,220
still working on that all um I need to
run it through

276
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,190
normal input to make sure false
positives don't happen

277
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,610
if a website using this code has lots of
false positives

278
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,350
they solve that problem by turning it
off

279
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,390
arm I need to put a

280
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,630
at test better place for you can go on
the web in

281
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,950
and enter your own input to test against
I need that publish

282
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,280
code coverage and Q-eight s an

283
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,380
I need add scripting languages a

284
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,810
but this should be done in the next
couple weeks so if you have

285
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,990
excess sources or if you love access ass

286
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,510
up please contact me and

287
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,030
I'm always looking for new sources
information and I'd love for you to try

288
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,790
out live injection XSS

289
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm as a final note these photos I was
an

290
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,530
California two weeks ago so this is
Death Valley

291
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,680
and thank you could blow for your time I
hope to see you

292
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,620
soon thanks
