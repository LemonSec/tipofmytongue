today we are going to share some

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
interesting things about non-private

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
chat police investigation legislation in

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,280
the flat world

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
this is our outline

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
the first part is about introduction of

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
police investigation

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,359
and some technology

12
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,120
about

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,239
messenger apps and its protection

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,840
in the second part

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,720
we will share several approaches

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,840
and cases in different countries

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
about the police investigation

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
legislation

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
and then

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
discuss about the issues between

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,799
governments

22
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,320
individual

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,639
and isps

24
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
before we start

25
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,840
let me introduce myself and my partner

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,400
i'm interested in web mobile blockchain

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,799
and privacy issues

30
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
i shared some research on cold blue last

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
year

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
econobox

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
and hikon

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
my partner is joy ho

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,479
is a phd candidate from suzhou

36
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,560
university

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
she is interested in

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
data protection and privacy issue

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
that starts from monitoring

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
and police investigation history

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
about 400 bc

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,840
the earliest records about money turing

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
uh device

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
is spying

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,879
brazilian

46
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
bury the brazilian and cover a litter

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,959
on the bottle mouse you can hear the

48
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,599
vibration from the army 100 miles away

49
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,200
or the voice nearby

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
with the advance of science and

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
technology

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
people change their communication ways

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
the skills or device

54
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
of monitoring

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
also improved

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
from micro device named mousetails and

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
telephone

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
capture the signal from cell phone base

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
station

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,159
and final some

61
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,519
rat and spywares on pc and mobile phone

62
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,120
all their purpose

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
is to get information and spy

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,560
the communication

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
here's an example

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
in 2006

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,959
a group with four people planned to rob

68
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
an armored car

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
and they tried to kill drivers and

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
guards and take away the money

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,040
taiwan police once gets the informations

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,560
that's they are going to rob the car

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
they install

74
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,799
the mouse sales to

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,159
monitor

76
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,680
their information and they finally catch

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
the four people

78
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,319
before they start to rob the car

79
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,799
it reminds me about the

80
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,640
minority reports a famous movie

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
information is powerful and important in

82
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
criminal investigation

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,918
but also brings private issue

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,400
nowaday

85
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
messenger apps are part of

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
our daily life

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,320
people use it for everything

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,360
chat

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,479
work

90
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,320
information switching

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,720
and probably for criminal also

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
we have several popular messengers like

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
whatsapp

94
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
facebook

95
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,479
telegram

96
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
and signal

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
some of them are

98
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
popular in different regions for example

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
whatsapp

100
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
facebook messenger and telegram are

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,280
popular in united states

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,600
and europe

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
wechat

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
online kakaotalk are popular in east and

105
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
south asia

106
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,639
so before we start to dig into the

107
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
technical parts

108
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,039
i want to show you some important and

109
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
sensitive information

110
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,960
that are all in the messenger apps

111
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
the first part is personal information

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,720
some people will put their names on

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
display names or status

114
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
and the number two

115
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
phone numbers

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
maybe it's not so hard to get phone

117
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
numbers in count some countries but in

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,880
taiwan to apply a personal

119
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
phone number you have to bring

120
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
at least two identifications to prove

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
who you are

122
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,039
and they can check these

123
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,840
phone numbers to chase who you are

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,639
number three a profile

125
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,199
the profile is one of the easiest way to

126
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,160
find out who you are

127
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
number four

128
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
location

129
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
location is sensitive too

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
it's easy to chase your movement

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,120
if the system gains enough data

132
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
and the last one

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
account and password

134
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,360
lots of people use weak password or one

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
combinations

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
for all different services

137
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
the next one is sensitive information

138
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,039
here we are talking about the secrecy of

139
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,759
communication

140
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
all the type

141
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,840
of message

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
in chats or accounts like text

143
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
image video

144
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,599
voice message

145
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,759
are the content of the conversations

146
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,479
and the last one is the ip address and

147
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,840
device information

148
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
with announced amount of this kind of

149
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
information

150
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
we can recognize a certain device owner

151
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,599
indirectly

152
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,599
so now we know there's a bunch of

153
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,160
sensitive informations in

154
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
messenger apps

155
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
and the service provider also know about

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
that

157
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
and they want to protect the secrecy of

158
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
communications

159
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
so they deploy

160
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
e2e

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,479
end to end encryption

162
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360
in messenger apps

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
so what is

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
e2e

165
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
here's the flow about e2e

166
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
first

167
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,080
the two clients have to send public key

168
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
to each others

169
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,840
and create

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,360
a secret key

171
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,879
with divi helmet exchange

172
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
so let's see the key is only stored in

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,719
two clients

174
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,519
and the step two

175
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,559
the one of the clients will use the

176
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
private key to encrypt

177
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,630
messages and send it to

178
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,919
[Music]

179
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,199
the other client

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
no the flow will pass the

181
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
application server but the message is

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
encrypt

183
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
and only can decrypt by

184
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,079
the clients who owns the secret key

185
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
so there are some

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
examples about this kind of protocol

187
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
like

188
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,080
mt proto in telegram or literal ceiling

189
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
in line

190
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
so let's

191
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
have a comparation about

192
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
the messenger apps and e2e

193
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
so we these five

194
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,200
different

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,279
messenger apps

196
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,080
in this table

197
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
so first

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
about e2e settings

199
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
most of the

200
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
applications their

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,080
e to e are defaults on

202
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
but

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
facebook and telegram

204
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
they only open um

205
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
some

206
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
specific function

207
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
and the next one is the protocol we have

208
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,079
discussed about that

209
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
and you can mention there's a backup

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
in the table we will explain

211
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,079
why we put backup

212
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
in this table

213
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
later

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
also we can see that they have the

215
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
police support

216
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
they will

217
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
support

218
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
the information to the police

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
in

220
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,399
some conditions

221
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,480
then we dig into

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
the messages

223
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
for facebook messenger and telegram

224
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,720
only when user use certain functions

225
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,839
like secret conversations or secret

226
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
chats

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,880
will have e2e

228
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,399
but i heard that

229
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
facebook messenger is going to deploy

230
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
e2e

231
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,560
in the old services

232
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
and another difference you can check is

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,959
the group chat

234
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,480
most of the messengers not support e2e

235
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,000
or limit support

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,279
because the overhead of secret key

237
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,519
recalculations and decryptions is large

238
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
so that's why they only support limits

239
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,079
group members for performance

240
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,560
and then we'll discuss about the backup

241
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,600
why we discussed about the backup here

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,880
because

243
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
actually

244
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
user when they receive a encrypt message

245
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
they will decrypt the message

246
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,600
and then they will save the plaintext

247
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,760
into the local

248
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
database

249
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,880
so

250
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,120
how can user backup their message

251
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
they will copy

252
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
their local database

253
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
into

254
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,839
the

255
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,800
or into other ways somehow

256
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
stagger extractors

257
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
for user to extract the plain text

258
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,450
to

259
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,880
[Music]

260
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,760
the new phone or new storage

261
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
so actually

262
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
the storage of the plaintext is in local

263
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
database and is out of

264
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,440
the e2e coverage

265
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,720
so if the attacker wants to get a plain

266
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
text

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
from client side

268
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
the best target

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,480
is from the local database

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
and also if you want to monitor a

271
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
messenger apps

272
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,200
it's hard to break the e2e but it's easy

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
or you can say it's more easier to get

274
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,040
the plain text in database

275
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
so

276
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,360
that has a little summarize about how

277
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,519
can the attacker or monitor

278
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,279
try to get the messages

279
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,839
not only as i mentioned about

280
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,720
the backup in the cloud or local

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,360
database

282
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
also from

283
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,040
like spying apps or malicious plugins

284
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
indoor label

285
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
or somehow the client-side apps is

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
vulnerable

287
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
they have a chance to get the plain text

288
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
messages

289
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,199
from

290
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,079
the client side

291
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,560
and on the server side

292
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
the situation is more complicated

293
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,600
besides the vulnerabilities

294
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
probably they will have um

295
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
developers

296
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,199
back doors

297
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,320
or monitoring systems that can decrypt

298
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,120
some messages and provide it to

299
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
authority

300
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
so here is a quick summary of the first

301
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
part

302
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,199
i share about why message apps

303
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,720
matters in

304
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
police investigation is all about the

305
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,320
informations

306
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
then i shared the e2e encryption and its

307
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,079
scope

308
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,240
then

309
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,040
the technical possibilities of spying

310
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,320
apps

311
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399
needed in police investigations

312
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,199
or other ways could get the information

313
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
so here i mentioned about the

314
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,399
information is about the plaintext

315
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,600
and also the sensitive or personal

316
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,680
informations

317
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
in

318
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,839
the

319
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,519
previous

320
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
page

321
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,959
and then

322
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,160
we will start steps to the legislation

323
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,040
and approaches

324
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
and here i will introduce my partner on

325
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
joy to start to introduce about this

326
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,040
part

327
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
hello everyone i'm joy

328
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,399
i'm going to introduce the legislation

329
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,920
and approaches to you

330
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,639
let's start from yeah let's start from

331
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
the taiwan case

332
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,360
uh it's a gps case in 2017

333
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
a shift surgeon jeff marin petro agency

334
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
has been convicted because of using gps

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
illegally to investigate smart gold

336
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,079
cigarettes

337
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,959
the judgment has a roast discussion

338
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,199
about the usage of high-tech and

339
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,600
criminal investigation

340
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,160
the discussion led to the draft

341
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
legislation of technology investigation

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,399
act we also call it tia

343
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
in the 2017 case

344
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
let's see what did the court say

345
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,759
the court said that first

346
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,120
the shift surgeon's behavior using gpas

347
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
to record the truck drivers whereabouts

348
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,439
information

349
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,240
constitutes crime of obstructing secrets

350
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
so he faced criminal detention for 50

351
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
days

352
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
second the court expressed that

353
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
new zealand gps could collect the trucks

354
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
location chronically

355
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,240
after analyzing the truck's long-term

356
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
location data

357
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
the investigators could know the

358
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,039
driver's daily routine and behavior

359
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
pattern

360
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
this infringes individual privacy

361
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
seriously

362
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
also there's no legal basis to use the

363
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
new tank to investigate

364
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,360
by 2017

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,160
now we are going to introduce the idea

366
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,919
of private space in tia

367
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,400
people could have privacy in an

368
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,799
independent

369
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,880
confined

370
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
confined space

371
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
and that the individual must have a

372
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,320
reasonable expectation for privacy

373
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
so we could see the picture that inside

374
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,679
the car the internal space of the car is

375
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,320
private space but outside the car is

376
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
public and people have no privacy

377
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
expectation over it

378
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
we wonder how could this idea work by

379
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,640
telephone

380
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
so you can see by the right

381
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
right hand side

382
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
most communication software

383
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
provides encryption function just like

384
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,360
what we introduced to us

385
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,039
and it is point-to-point encryption

386
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,480
the tia now in taiwan allowed

387
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,000
investigative agencies and police

388
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,720
to perform communication monitoring by

389
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,080
employment by implanting children

390
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,400
programs on mobile phones computers

391
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,799
or tablets or other device sites

392
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,880
and that's introduced the traditional

393
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
monitor and the high-tech monitor

394
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,039
investigation in tia what's the

395
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,320
difference

396
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,600
what's the difference between the three

397
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,559
traditional monitor means that the place

398
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,600
would while taping the content of phone

399
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
call between individuals

400
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,120
the police need to wait for the evidence

401
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
show and the criminals do not know the

402
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
place is waiting

403
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
so it is passive and secret

404
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,720
traditional investigation means

405
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,440
the police come to knock your door and

406
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
show you the search warrant and ask you

407
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,840
to cooperate

408
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
the police could come into your house

409
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
and take the crime related stuff

410
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,520
so it's active and transparent

411
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
but the technology investigation in tia

412
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,159
could break the secret uh security of

413
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,200
individual smartphone and could get any

414
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
secret in the form

415
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,039
it is active and secret it shall be

416
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,679
deemed as more dangerous to people than

417
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
the traditional methods

418
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,880
now we are going to know the legal

419
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
development in different countries

420
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,360
first we came to the german approach

421
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
you can see according to the scope of

422
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
actual information

423
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,799
german separates the investigation to

424
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,640
two types

425
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,720
one is source site telecom monitoring

426
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
which means that communication

427
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,480
monitoring

428
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,919
people uh

429
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,640
that police must apply for the

430
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,760
author authorization monitor the

431
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,799
suspect's communication in the future

432
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,799
the police could only monitor the

433
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
ongoing communication but could not

434
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,120
store or access other information

435
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,320
this is also another way to do the

436
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,640
investigation which is called online

437
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,919
search

438
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,360
which means that

439
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
the police could access and store all

440
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,280
the information or data in the suspect's

441
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,520
cell phone

442
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,799
now about the online search there are a

443
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,120
few developments

444
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,200
in 2007

445
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,080
in a terrorist crime investigation

446
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
the court rejected the request using

447
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
online search

448
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
the reason is that there is no legal

449
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,159
basis and no authorization indicating

450
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,720
police could do it

451
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,039
in 2008

452
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,520
the court allows similar requests under

453
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
specific conditions

454
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,799
first

455
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,440
they must have a material risks to

456
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,360
important interests

457
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,799
such as life body of freedom or public

458
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,320
interest

459
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
second

460
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,039
the court

461
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,679
the court reservation principle must be

462
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,720
fully and clearly followed

463
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,679
third

464
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,240
the protective majors for personal

465
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,679
private life

466
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,960
has been existed

467
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
in 2016

468
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,400
the court allowed the request for

469
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,559
preventing the inter international

470
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,400
terrorism

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,799
the condition is

472
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,559
first the proportion

473
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,919
no the proportional principle must be

474
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,280
followed

475
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,400
second

476
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,520
they need to provide the randy mechanism

477
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,400
for protecting individuals right

478
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,960
third there must be a legal obligation

479
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
to destroy the access

480
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,719
personal information

481
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,200
in 2018

482
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,760
the criminal procedural law has been

483
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
amended and the online search has been

484
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,039
aided as article 49 secret intervention

485
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,640
of information technology system

486
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,919
now we come to japan

487
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,120
japanese communications balance act

488
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
came into force in 1999

489
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,600
started the country's scientific and

490
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,919
technological investigations

491
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,760
establishing legislative

492
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
principles

493
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,039
such as

494
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,960
limited to felony

495
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
relevance minimal infringement and less

496
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,799
research

497
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,919
the 2000 the amount amendment in 2016

498
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
has shown public attention that

499
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,039
this amendment has expanded the scope of

500
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,320
white taping and easing the rules

501
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,360
the all rules only apply to four types

502
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
of crimes

503
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
including

504
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
illegal drugs

505
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
firearms trade

506
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,279
human smoking and murders

507
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,840
involving an organization

508
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,000
but in the

509
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,360
2016 amendment

510
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,919
the scope of white taping by police

511
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,640
would include bolder types of crimes

512
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
such as fraud

513
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
deaths

514
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
murder and errors

515
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,559
this trigger the public concerns

516
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,480
such as the lack of

517
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,279
third party of the

518
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
observation

519
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,039
and the scope may keep expanding

520
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,080
by u.s approach

521
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,240
i will introduce a case instead of

522
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,640
introducing old structure of u.s law

523
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,000
in 2 in 2013

524
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
microsoft challenged a warrant by the

525
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,679
federal bureau of investigation

526
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,039
fbi

527
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,159
to turn over emails of a target account

528
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,159
stored in ireland

529
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,360
other than that a warrant issued on the

530
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,919
section of the stored

531
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,559
communication act could not compel

532
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,120
american country companies

533
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,159
to produce data stored in servers

534
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
outside the united states

535
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,640
the southern district of new york stated

536
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,240
that the nature of the stored

537
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,400
communication act warrant

538
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,559
was not subject to territorial

539
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
restriction

540
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,880
and microsoft appealed in the united

541
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,279
states court of appeals

542
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
for the second course

543
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
group circuit

544
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,400
who found in favor of microsoft by 2016

545
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
and invalided the warrant

546
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,080
in response the united states department

547
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,640
of justice appealed to the supreme court

548
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,720
of the united states

549
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,600
which decided to hear the equity appeal

550
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
but

551
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,679
while

552
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,840
the case is still pending in the supreme

553
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,799
court there's a new law which codes

554
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,159
clarifying

555
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,520
lawful overseas use of data act

556
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,480
which also called cloud act

557
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,039
the active the act passed in 2018

558
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,760
which allowed federal law enforcement

559
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,840
to compel you u.s companies to provide

560
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,240
data stored in the servers

561
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
regardless of whether they are stored in

562
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,679
the u.s

563
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,960
or on foreign store

564
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,840
now come to australia in australia

565
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,039
approach

566
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,840
the telecommunications amendment

567
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,919
uh

568
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,559
2018

569
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,120
established a framework for voluntary

570
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,159
and mandatory industrial assistance

571
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,640
to law enforcement

572
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880
which is

573
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,520
related to the encryption technologies

574
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,760
so you can see there are three

575
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
classification

576
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,520
of assistance

577
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,480
one is tars here is which quotes

578
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
technical assistance requests

579
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,640
which are voluntary voluntary requests

580
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
for

581
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
a communication provider to use a

582
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
decryption or other data access

583
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
capability they already have

584
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,279
second is tans

585
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,840
which are compulsory notice

586
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,480
for a communication provider

587
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,840
to use the capability they already have

588
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
and third is tcns

589
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,279
which are also compulsory notice

590
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,480
for the provider to build a new

591
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,320
capability so that it can fulfill

592
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
subsequent

593
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
technical assistance notice and

594
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,640
requesting

595
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
when we talk about the issue between

596
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,360
government and individual

597
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,000
the chat monitoring investigation will

598
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,320
definitely infringe in individual

599
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,080
privacy

600
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,279
so so

601
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,840
there must be some control measures to

602
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
balance

603
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
privacy impact

604
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
i listed here full checking points for

605
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,799
basic control

606
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,440
there must be more control measures but

607
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
there are basic

608
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,559
questions if we want to know the laws

609
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,760
first is

610
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,440
who could use technology investigation

611
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
generally police officers and other

612
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,960
criminal eva

613
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,480
investigative agencies have the

614
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
authority to use technical

615
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
investigation

616
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
then who approve it

617
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
prior to use

618
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,799
how to remove the children after the

619
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,520
investigation is ended

620
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,679
these are all the questions we want to

621
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,279
know in different countries

622
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,840
let's see the comparison in the five

623
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,440
countries

624
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,720
first in taiwan

625
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
when we come to the question that who

626
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,240
could approve

627
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,679
the request of using technology to do

628
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,600
investigation

629
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
some available technology technology

630
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,279
investigation such as gps

631
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,080
could be approved by the prosecutor

632
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,120
this rule leads to lots of arguments

633
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,159
but for the usage of the children

634
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,279
only judge can approve it

635
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,880
also about the

636
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,799
application scope

637
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,919
in taiwan drafted legislation the

638
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,279
statute about hiking investigation could

639
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,080
apply to a lot of crimes such as

640
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,960
financial crimes corruption

641
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,120
abstract abstract voting drugs essence

642
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
money laundry

643
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,159
about 18 types of crimes are included

644
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,279
and the tia rules that after the

645
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,679
investigation is completed

646
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,799
the trojan must be deleted

647
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,440
from the target cell phone and the cell

648
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,840
phone must be reverted to the original

649
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,240
stage this is a legislation it's an easy

650
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
statement

651
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,399
but from technical perspective

652
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,240
how could we do that

653
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,320
how could people trust the police would

654
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,799
do that

655
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
so we can also see

656
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,760
the

657
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,200
wording here i put that yes there's a

658
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
state the legal statement

659
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,039
but they do not guarantee

660
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,000
uh if the police or the investigative

661
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
agency would delete the children

662
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,799
and revert the cell phone

663
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,559
so in german we could see that

664
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,440
also

665
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,799
only judge can approve the request for

666
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,120
individual chat content

667
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,600
and the application scope is limited to

668
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
the listed

669
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,120
serious crimes

670
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
but what is special is that german law

671
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,480
requested the police to guarantee to

672
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
remove the children

673
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,840
and restore the individual equipment to

674
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,240
original state

675
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,640
but even there is a guarantee

676
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
there is still no effective way for

677
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,679
suspects to confirm the children is

678
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,679
removed

679
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,200
and in japan u.s and australia

680
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,679
there's no such rules requesting police

681
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,880
to remove children if they use it

682
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,559
when there

683
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,640
are always

684
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,000
some rules or some standard

685
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,519
to limit to limit the application scope

686
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
although technology companies have been

687
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,039
actively stressing

688
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,919
user data protection and providing

689
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
better encryption measures in recent

690
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,600
years

691
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,919
law involvement agencies in many

692
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,120
countries have taken a negative attitude

693
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,320
and have begun to formulate rules

694
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
requiring technology

695
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
companies to cooperate with the

696
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
government to provide user data

697
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,960
decryption

698
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,080
to protect national security

699
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,720
so the issue here would be the

700
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,399
relationship between government and isp

701
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,240
companies

702
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,159
could government request or compel isps

703
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,039
to

704
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,559
provide

705
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,080
users communication content

706
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,600
how about in different jurisdictions

707
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,159
do isv have the legal obligation to

708
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,240
leave a backdoor for police need

709
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,840
these are what we want to ask

710
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,440
so here we could see the comparison of

711
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
five approaches

712
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,000
for the first question

713
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,480
could government request or compile ict

714
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,279
to provide my communication content

715
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,960
in taiwan yes in german yes

716
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,559
in japan especially that as no

717
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,360
but

718
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,720
the isp do have an obligation to

719
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,880
preserve the evidence

720
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
to preserve the chat

721
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,239
in u.s it's yes and in

722
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,439
australia ics

723
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,639
and how about the chat content is stored

724
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,839
in the server in different

725
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,800
jurisdictions in taiwan and still yes

726
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,280
the isps still have the obligation to

727
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,399
provide

728
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,159
and german also

729
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,679
in

730
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,639
u.s and australia is also the same

731
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
but in japan it's no

732
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
just like what you can see in the column

733
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,239
there's only the prism

734
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,760
preservation

735
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,560
of occasion

736
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,000
so we came to the third question do isp

737
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
have the legal obligation to leave a

738
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,399
backdoor for police need

739
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,760
in taiwan know in the explanation it may

740
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
be

741
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,839
in german

742
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,720
snow and

743
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,680
japanese also know in u.s and australia

744
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,160
yes it's definitely

745
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,359
they have the obligation to cooperate to

746
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,720
assist

747
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,879
the government

748
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,320
now we come to the conclusion

749
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,680
the issue is could we sacrifice a bit

750
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,000
privacy or in

751
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
while encountering difficulties

752
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,839
investigating severe crimes

753
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:32,800
yes

754
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
but we need always limit the police

755
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,040
power

756
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,079
therefore the basic principle such as

757
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:44,000
proportionality and due process shall be

758
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,160
always considered

759
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,560
also only judge could decide the request

760
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,760
the use

761
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
of the high technology

762
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,320
for investigation

763
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,119
so this is all the issue

764
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:01,839
in

765
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,839
