1
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,479
hey everybody at code blue it's so happy

2
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
i'm glad you came

3
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,040
thank you for being here i promised me i

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
promise you we'll try not to be boring

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,640
um let's go ahead and introduce

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
ourselves sure everyone i'm ducky um

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,960
also occasionally known as michael

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,559
rodriguez um when i'm not working on

9
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,559
maritime stuff with nina i'm a principal

10
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,280
consultant with mandiant

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
um okay so i'm nina collars i am

12
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,079
sometimes referred to as kitty but

13
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
everybody just calls me nina anyway

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
um so i am a professor at the united

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
states naval war college um but i am

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
also just a good friend to ducky and we

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,439
spend a lot of time at

18
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,560
defcon

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
which is a

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,720
infosec and hacking convention in the

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
united states and so we're very excited

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
to be taking part at code blue this year

23
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,560
and we're really hoping to come see you

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
all in person next year

25
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,040
but let's not get ahead of ourselves so

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,960
what do we want to talk about today

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
so the reason we're here talking to you

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
guys is

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,159
because what we'd like to bring to code

30
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,520
blue next year is some conversations and

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
kind of fun activities around maritime

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
cyber security what's maritime cyber

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
security

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
so maritime cyber security is um

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,079
kind of any

36
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,680
infosec problems or issues that revolve

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
around the ocean

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
as you know most of the earth is the

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,799
ocean something like over 90 percent of

40
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
commerce

41
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,200
is is transacted that way

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
goods have to get from point a to point

43
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,199
b um and the ocean's still the fastest

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
best cheapest way we have to get it

45
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,760
there

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
um but

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
uh things have gone a bit weird lately

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,239
um so we have pirates again that's new

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
um actual like hey this is our ship now

50
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
we're gonna take it pirates

51
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,400
um we have uh

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,879
geopolitical issues as far as other

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
nation states um kind of

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
being less than friendly over the

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
friendly seas

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
um

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,519
and

58
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,319
yeah so i so what keeps me up at night

59
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,640
about what is vulnerable about maritime

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,319
and i think what's interesting about

61
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,959
this question is everybody is excited to

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
talk about industrial control systems or

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
ics and people are excited to talk about

64
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,920
land-based cyber vulnerabilities or

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
infosec problems uh privacy making sure

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,720
that your connections are

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,959
secure and stable one of the things that

68
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,599
we don't think about very often however

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
is that we need the communication

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
systems that happen under the ocean

71
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
the communication systems that happen

72
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,760
above the ocean and then the ships on

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
the ocean to be equally as secure so

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
ducky has said that 90 of the world's

75
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,400
economy runs on the ocean and over the

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
last

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
probably three decades

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
all of that commerce all those systems

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
to include uh to include militaries

80
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,120
but also just everyday civilian ships um

81
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
everyday persons ships and companies

82
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
they have automated so much of those

83
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,120
systems that now for a giant

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
container ship

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
there might be maybe 30 people total on

86
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
the ship

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,879
because so much of it has been automated

88
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
and as we know from the history of

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,319
automation

90
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,959
security is often the last thing people

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,799
think about and it's one of our major

92
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,120
concerns so from your perspective ducky

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
what are some of the major problems with

94
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
what do you think about when i say

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
maritime cyber vulnerability sure so we

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,120
are all have gone through and are still

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
going through a global pandemic

98
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,918
um and when it comes to and you know

99
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,238
these are things i think about as a

100
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,120
cyber security practitioner who who

101
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
delves mostly in

102
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,280
private sector and and commerce not

103
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
always necessarily in government issues

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
and so the things they worry about is

105
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,520
that uh

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
again the reason i brought the pandemic

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,759
is is because

108
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
um aside from worrying things like being

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
in the u.s and saying hey um i can't

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,320
find a ps5 or a nintendo switch anywhere

111
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
um

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,240
there's also goods there's food there is

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
vaccines there's medicines there are

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
other things that that people and

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
depending on your part of the world you

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
don't just

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
need it to be comfortable you need it to

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
live literally

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
um and and so

120
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,639
as you mentioned the rise of automation

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
um

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,199
and despite it being such a large field

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
um i don't often see a lot of research

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
in it you know right now a lot of the

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
the and this is where nina's research

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
and my work kind of overlap sometimes is

127
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
that

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,080
it's still very much nation states that

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,639
are the ones that are kind of uh

130
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
abusing technology when it comes to

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
maritime issues whether that be aas

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,080
transponders or gps spoofing things like

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
that of that nature

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
as we all know it's only a matter of

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,759
time before that is commoditized before

136
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
you know anyone with a not even a large

137
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
amount of money and not a lot of funding

138
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,520
um can exploit these things in fact just

139
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
recently so if you're not a person who

140
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
thinks about maritime vulnerability

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
um you probably wouldn't have heard of

142
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,840
these stories i think everybody knows

143
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
that supply chains are compressed and i

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
don't mean supply chain in the infosec

145
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,560
way i mean supply chain is in how do

146
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
goods go from one country to another

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
country supply chain so um so we have

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,639
been through the pandemic we have

149
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
realized these supply chains are

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
vulnerable but if you haven't thought

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
about maritime vulnerability you

152
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
probably don't know that there have been

153
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,880
major attacks over the last

154
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
gosh maybe year and a half

155
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
on port terminals around the world and

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
so the port is the space itself and the

157
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
terminal is the uh all the machinery

158
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
that gets goods from the ship back on to

159
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
land and off again so these these uh

160
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,080
terminals have been attacked uh most

161
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
recently the most recent cases that i

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
remember ones in houston

163
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,199
um there was a set in south africa um

164
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,280
and then i think everybody remembers the

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
um the accidental case which would be

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,160
not petya on the shipping company so

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
it's a really big problem

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
and i think as ducky said we're just not

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
seeing very much research

170
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
from people in the infosec community

171
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
on this question in particular just

172
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
given how large it is and so it's it's

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
an area of concern for us one of the

174
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
things that we want to do at code blue

175
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
is start to create that community that

176
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
comes together to think about it and

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,160
we'll talk about that in a second i just

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
want to say a little bit from my

179
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
perspective because ducky's perspective

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
comes at it from um i think from the

181
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,479
corporate or commercial side um and so

182
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,840
he's thinking about how to protect

183
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
businesses better

184
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,319
my concern working um for the department

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
of defense in the united states and the

186
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
navy comes at it from a navy perspective

187
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,759
so um the u.s navy and associated navies

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,599
around the world are in charge of

189
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,759
helping to keep what we call the freedom

190
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
of navigation and so how do you keep all

191
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
these ships all of these um commercial

192
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,319
ships flowing and that that is in part

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,039
the responsibility of the coast guard

194
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,000
and the navy it's the responsibility of

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
um the international shipping companies

196
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,639
it's the responsibility of the ports and

197
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
the captains of the port so there's so

198
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
many uh um overlapping responsibilities

199
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
and for me as a person who works for the

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,720
navy

201
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
not quite understanding how that all

202
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,199
comes together uh

203
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,800
it has me a little bit worried because i

204
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
know a lot of it is not well protected

205
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
and i think right now we need to be

206
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
thinking about how to create security

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
before the before the next major

208
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,960
incident occurs

209
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
right and so

210
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
building on what nina just said

211
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
um

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,199
the interesting thing is is that we'd

213
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
call it maritime infosec and and a lot

214
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,519
of folks might think that that ends at

215
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
the stuff on the on on and under the

216
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
water right

217
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
but it very much doesn't so that the

218
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
interface between the maritime transport

219
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,120
and land right those ports

220
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,160
um you know other major shipping centers

221
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
um that's a problem too right there's

222
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,279
vulnera a lot of the cranes are

223
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,560
automated

224
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
so ransomware attack can just

225
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,360
take them right out um and there's lots

226
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
of other cyber attacks as well um and

227
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
there's also the problem can also be

228
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,560
bigger than just a port right so if

229
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
you're familiar if you fly a lot or if

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
you used to or you will again

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
um

232
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
you know you'll you'll know sometimes

233
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
that if you know

234
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
um the large airport uh near me so you

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
know um

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
newark liberty international airport if

237
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,959
there's a

238
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,279
hurricane or if there's an issue where

239
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
you know ewr is backed up that cascades

240
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,160
throughout the entire

241
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
um air traffic

242
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
environment right and so if you are

243
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
flying out of 95 airport

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,240
and your flight is delayed it could very

245
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,760
well be not

246
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,200
their fault it could be something that

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
happened on the other side of the world

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
right the other side of the pacific

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
um the same the very much the same thing

250
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,519
happens with maritime trade that's true

251
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,160
you have one port that suffers an attack

252
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
um and there are goods that are now

253
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,040
going to back up and cascade and not get

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,640
to where they need to all over the world

255
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
there's a lot of money that's get wasted

256
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,839
um

257
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,800
you know a lot of times in maritime

258
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
transport much like in infosec and much

259
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
like in information technology there's a

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,959
lot of just in time kind of shipping and

261
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
the fuel on vessels is is measured down

262
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
to the the last ounce

263
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,800
um

264
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,519
and so any delay can cost

265
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,519
uh you know untold amounts of money that

266
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
just keep

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,680
keeps escalating so it's a it's it's

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
very much a global problem and so i

269
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,959
wonder

270
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,480
why do we so

271
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,680
ducky and i have been thinking about

272
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
this problem in the united states we met

273
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,320
at def con where we talked about um we

274
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
both thought this was a big issue we

275
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
have some friends at def con and we have

276
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
some friends around the world who are

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
who are very interested in growing our

278
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,560
community of people who worry about this

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
who do research on this who want to

280
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
develop good policy

281
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
um

282
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
ducky why japan

283
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,079
um

284
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,480
that's a great question so

285
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,519
one of the things that you know i've

286
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,680
noticed to begin with is that maritime

287
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,920
again despite it being such a large

288
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
vertical such a large sector

289
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
um doesn't get enough love um there's

290
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
not a ton of research um that is done uh

291
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
around the topic

292
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,680
um

293
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
there's some in the u.s

294
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
um but you know japan has some of the

295
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
largest ports in the world some of the

296
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,920
largest volumes of

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
of traffic and commerce

298
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
flow through japan

299
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,279
um

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
and we started asking ourselves the

301
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
question of well

302
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
that's awesome there must be tons of

303
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
research in japan there must be tons of

304
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
people who are thinking about this

305
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
problem and oh my god we're we are silly

306
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,600
because we

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
should have thought of that to begin

308
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
with

309
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
um and maybe there is and maybe you're

310
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
just hiding or maybe we haven't heard or

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,560
maybe so my my my my uh my kana reading

312
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,079
has gotten really bad over the years so

313
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,320
maybe i just maybe it's not yet um

314
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
written in english which is also fine

315
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
but we want to find you or we want you

316
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
to get interested in thinking about this

317
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
question we think that the japanese well

318
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,560
from

319
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
from the united states navy perspective

320
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
the japanese have been long allies great

321
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,000
friends um and our u.s coast guard is

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
very familiar and so i think it just

323
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
makes good sense to start talking about

324
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
bringing this conversation not just

325
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,839
inside the united states but

326
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
internationally and also i just have a

327
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,839
very deep love of japan and i know ducky

328
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,639
does too um and in fact i feel bad now

329
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,440
because we didn't even start our whole

330
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
our whole greeting we should have said

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
hello

332
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
sort of kunichiwa it's uh i think it's

333
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,360
afternoon actually i don't know when the

334
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,519
show is is airing but anyway

335
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,959
it's nice to meet you

336
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,830

to find all of you in japan who are

349
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,920
interested in maritime security

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,959
um

351
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
whether you're thinking about it or you

353
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120

to an awesome conference like code blue

356
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,200
consider this an invitation to do that

357
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,519
as soon as the cfps are open for

358
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
code blue in 2022 we hope to see some

359
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
amazing research projects and papers

360
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
from you guys

361
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040

362
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
we are super excited

363
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
if you decide that you'd like to have us

364
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
to come back in 2022 and bring

365
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,320
um

366
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
the things we've been working on

367
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
um bring kind of our love of the infosec

368
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
community to japan

369
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
um and there's a few ways that we're

370
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
we're thinking of doing that right so

371
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
um we have a couple of uh partners that

372
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,639
we work with in the atlantic council and

373
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,440
another

374
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
um organization called fathom five um so

375
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
we'd like to bring

376
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,079
um from our side we'd like to bring some

377
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,320
uh talks already kind of pre-canned for

378
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
you guys

379
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
um about maritime infosec um discussions

380
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
around policy because

381
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,920
um

382
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,519
one of the interesting things these days

383
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
is and a lot of you probably already

384
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,880
know this is this not every solution is

385
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,360
a technical one um it's not a matter of

386
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
throwing up an ids or a firewall and

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
setting up a sim and like oh good we'll

388
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
catch all the evil

389
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,120
that's good it needs to be done right

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
you know vulnerabilities and software

391
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
and hardware need to be discussed and

392
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
patched and mitigated

393
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
but the other side of that is is also

394
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,639
policy

395
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
right there needs to be legislation

396
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,880
there needs to be um

397
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
international cooperation right we need

398
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,199
to start a strong dialogue between the

399
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,160
infosec communities um anybody who likes

400
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,079
to play with maritime technologies even

401
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,240
if it's your first time right we need to

402
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
start having the japanese start working

403
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
with with hopefully with the united

404
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,959
states

405
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,199
and just just build a nice

406
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
healthy community one of the things i

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
hope again if we can be there in 2022

408
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
one of the things i hope to do is bring

409
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
one of our dear friends uh gary kessler

410
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,480
um he is an ais um

411
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,399
educators so he can teach some classes

412
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,320
on what ais is which is an international

413
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
ship tracking system

414
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,079
and he can teach you about ais and teach

415
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,600
you how to work with it teach you what

416
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
its vulnerabilities are um and what are

417
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
some of the things we can bring

418
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,040
so we have another partner like

419
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
mentioned before fathom five so one of

420
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,199
the fun things that we do um

421
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,160
at the maritime ics village at defcon

422
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
and in a couple other places in the u.s

423
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
is we have what is called a ctf

424
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
um so i'm not sure how well this is

425
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
going to translate but normally right

426
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
it's ctf capture the flag in this case

427
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,920
it's

428
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,560
s-e-a as an ocean

429
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,199
right um and that's because

430
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,759
it's our take on a traditional ctf so

431
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,480
the the awesome folks at fathom five

432
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
um have created a system that lets you

433
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,240
hack into the bridge systems of a large

434
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,680
vessel

435
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,240
you can with the ultimate aim of causing

436
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,639
some serious mischief um so there's

437
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,519
points to be scored um if you're you

438
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,240
know already a veteran pen tester it's a

439
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,839
great way to cut your teeth in kind of a

440
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
new environment

441
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,560
if you've never done a ctf in your life

442
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,519
uh it's better still right because it

443
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,440
gives you you know there's not too many

444
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,720
chances or there are not too many

445
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
opportunities for someone to invite you

446
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
on their vessel and ask you to sink it

447
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
uh or make it just

448
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,920
turn in circles for days right um so

449
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,040
that's one of the other things that we

450
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
have to bring and along with so i wanted

451
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,279
to ask ducky do you think that a person

452
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
who doesn't speak english

453
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,600
natively or very well would be able to

454
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,079
do the the ctf

455
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,480
oh without a doubt okay why so yeah i

456
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,520
mean

457
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,839
computers all speak the same language

458
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,599
um you know

459
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,839
even if uh

460
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
we'll we'll pick on an open source os

461
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
right so even if your copy of linux is

462
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
localized for for japanese

463
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
all the stuff that underpins it all runs

464
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,240
the same so

465
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,839
even if you're not you know the world's

466
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,720
most prolific english speaker

467
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
you'll still be able to do it and still

468
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,720
be able to have a lot of fun doing it in

469
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
fact so we are proud we're so proud of

470
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,400
our friends at fathom five um that last

471
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
year nope it would be last august this

472
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,840
year stefcon

473
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,200
um uh father the winners of the fathom

474
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
five ctf got the black badge

475
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,880
and so it was a very exciting time for

476
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
that team it's a very exciting time for

477
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
five and five um so now there will be a

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
black badge competition it'll be amazing

479
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,559
it's gonna be a lot of fun we're also

480
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,720
hoping to bring some education um so uh

481
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
again as you mentioned our friend gary

482
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
kessler um who is an ais expert and

483
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
we've got access to lots of other super

484
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
super smart folks smarter than us much

485
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,880
smarter um who want to share right it's

486
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,840
it's the purest form of

487
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,559
of our respective infosec communities

488
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,320
right which is sharing information

489
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
learning from each other playing

490
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
at the same time but also learning

491
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
important things and and things that at

492
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
the end of the day also help other

493
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,360
people

494
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
right the the whole point of infosec is

495
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,600
not just to keep systems safe but the

496
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
people behind them i think that's right

497
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
so i think and then the final thing that

498
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,919
i really want to stress i like to stress

499
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
in part because of my day job but also

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
because

501
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,440
the policy area is more my expertise

502
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
is is to think about it's not enough to

503
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
teach people about the system it's not

504
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
enough to educate them on how to make it

505
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
safer

506
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
at the technical level but as ducky had

507
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,520
said we have to make it we have to make

508
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
it safer and better not just the

509
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
machines but the people in the processes

510
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,799
also so

511
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
working together with some united

512
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
states-based think tanks

513
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,360
like our friends of the atlantic council

514
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
we want to bring the policy

515
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
so just like sort of a hat right you've

516
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
got the machines you've got the people

517
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
you've got the policies and then i want

518
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
the policy hat on top that says this is

519
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,720
how united states this is how japan this

520
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
is how uh companies this is how cyber

521
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,360
security firms uh can work together to

522
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
create this safe robust place again to

523
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
sort of protect better protect that 90

524
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,960
percent of the world's traffic uh and

525
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
trade and so that is our you know it's

526
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
not it's a small task it's not a big

527
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,640
task at all so but we're we want we want

528
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,559
to grow this community organically so

529
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,720
we're we're really excited

530
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,559
yeah so you know thanks for for watching

531
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,280
this

532

um in the next year um between your

533
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
awesome experience at cobalu this year

534
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
and by the next time that they that you

535
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,159
know the announcement comes out from

536
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,480
when code blue 22 is going to happen

537
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
um we really really ask that you think

538
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
about this stuff if if it's something

539
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,159
that you've not

540
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,960
considered before um look into it um

541
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,159
it's it's

542
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,840

um you have plenty of time

544
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
um but it's kind of like

545
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
a sort of untapped field to think about

546
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
um and kind of the sky is the limit with

547
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,600
that

548
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
