1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,879
thank you very much

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,279
greetings from australia

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,480
where it's springtime

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,320
um

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,639
so today i'm here to speak to you about

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,759
something that actually the japanese

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,600
government sent over

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
a group of people

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,119
in 2011 to australia

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,279
and they asked questions about cyber

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
security and psychology research

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
and so at the time

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
i led them to the three or four people

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
working in that area

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,200
but i quickly discovered

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
why wasn't i working in that area

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680
and so i've started to move my work and

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
my research

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
heavily into behavior

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,239
so thank you for that japanese

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,600
delegation in 2011.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
i won't be speaking to you today from

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
any one perspective not from my role as

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
a professor as an author

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,439
as a champion of human rights

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
or as a cyber crime investigator

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
i'm going to be sharing only my opinion

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,360
as a person

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
when i first moved to australia

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
i arrived via canada via hong kong where

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,400
i had worked previously

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,759
and i went to the famous bondi beach

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,880
and at that beach on my first time to a

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
beach in australia

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
i saw this man on the left

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,880
and i thought oh my goodness where have

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
i moved to

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
this is so bad

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
later i found out

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,240
that he is sasha baron cohen

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,759
a very famous actor

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,280
now

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
you're probably thinking

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,439
what does borat have to do with

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
chocolate mars bar

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
and this man to the right

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,600
this man to the right is the brother of

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,919
sasha baron cohen

49
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,959
and one of the first people to start to

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,680
do cyber security behavior research

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,640
there was a research where they handed

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
out a free chocolate to people on the

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
london metro

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
in exchange if they gave them their

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
username and password

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,519
and i thought nobody would be dumb

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
enough to do that but it turns out most

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,080
people were

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
now this was back a very long time ago

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
but in many ways

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,959
we haven't improved

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,080
so

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
what i want to talk to you today is

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
about the the following thing

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
there

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,440
are

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,120
11

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
000

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
new

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
cyber security technologies

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
that are developed

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
and released for purchase

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
every year

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
and cyber security is getting worse

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,840
not better

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
this is because

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,159
cyber security is not a computer science

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
problem

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
and so the world has recently begun to

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
really understand

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
how much more is involved in cyber

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
security

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
so i'll start with a little story

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,799
i was hired to deliver cyber terrorism

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,000
and training

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,959
on

87
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
to the people responsible for security

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,799
at parliament and senate buildings in

89
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
canada and the united states

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
and so it was my honor to be there for a

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
week

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,439
i also received all of the

93
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,040
anti-terrorism training including

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,080
gunshots and how you enter a building

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
but at the end of the the training i

96
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,480
asked the chief of security

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
what his job was

98
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
and he said

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,358
he's responsible for all security in the

100
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,199
parliament building

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,320
as well as doing tours

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,080
of the building

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,960
for

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
people

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
coming from other countries like foreign

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,840
dignitaries

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
so i scratched my head

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
and i said can you take me on the tour

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
that you do

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,199
so he did and it was all very nice

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,000
and then he took me back to his office

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,440
and then i said what do you do now

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
and he said

114
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
we offer coffee tea

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
and usually they show me pictures of

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
their family

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
and i said that's really nice

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
i said how do they show you pictures of

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
your family

120
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
and he said

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
often they give me a usb

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
and i

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,960
went what

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,120
a usb

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,039
why wouldn't they take out their mobile

126
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
phone and just show you pictures of

127
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
their family

128
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
on a mobile phone

129
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,840
he did not

130
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,560
understand

131
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
that they were putting malware on a

132
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
system

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,199
and so

134
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,600
we only have to look back to two really

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
serious issues in the last 10 years that

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
have come from usb

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
and that of course is stuxnets were

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,720
that slowed down

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
the spinning

140
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
of the uranium which destroyed the

141
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
nuclear program in iran or delayed it

142
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
for several years and then of course it

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
was an espionage situation in mar logo

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
um

145
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
as well up i put in a usb and it spread

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,639
from there

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,720
so what we decided to do was something a

148
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
little bit different

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,720
i am very lucky in that i get to travel

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
um extensively in the world for my job

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,720
not during covid but before covid we

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
took 50 usbs

153
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,840
and i put them in airports all around

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,319
the world so i left them there

155
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
and people picked them up

156
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,880
and when they put them in their system

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
a message popped up and said

158
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
you really should not plug in usbs if

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
you don't if they're not yours and you

160
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
really should not buy cheap at usb's

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
ever

162
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,720
and then we told them all the risks

163
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
now when they plugged it in that usb

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,880
sent a beacon signal back to us

165
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
at that point i asked the person

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
to email me

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,479
and then to take the usb

168
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
and drop it off in a different airport

169
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
the next time they flew

170
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
now the vast majority of people who

171
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
picked up this usb

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,639
were senior business people

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
who put them into their computers

174
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,160
and so behavior really

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
is as fundamental as any computer

176
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,639
science program developed in cyber

177
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
security

178
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,479
the last usb i left was in malaysia

179
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,960
right before colvin and i haven't gone

180
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
back since so i'm looking forward to

181
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,240
dropping my usbs off again

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
in a post covered world

183
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
so

184
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,199
i often describe my job as gu

185
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,000
so

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
working between disciplines

187
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
because these days if you're on a cyber

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,520
security team you will have people

189
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
working in all sorts of different areas

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
right all across the spectrum and so

191
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,840
these are projects that i'm working on

192
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
at the moment

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
some with government

194
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
some with industry

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,720
and some with universities because again

196
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
cyber security really sits as a vertical

197
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
and a horizontal

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,879
the vertical is research and development

199
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,479
of products that are unique to cyber

200
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,680
security

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
and the horizontal is that cyber

202
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,400
security now factors into everything we

203
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
do in life

204
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,960
and so when someone asks me

205
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,839
um do you work in cyber security

206
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
i say yes but in a specific field

207
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
it's as broad as asking someone

208
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
do you work in health

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,320
because you could be a doctor

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,839
a nurse

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,519
work in a lab

212
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,640
janitor

213
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,519
everything these are all part of health

214
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,920
so i want to tell you a little bit about

215
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
something we discovered by accident

216
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,120
during covid

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,240
as you know everyone when covet hit

218
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,880
and things were shut down started to

219
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
work from home

220
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
and we saw during that time an

221
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
exponential

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
spike in both cyber attacks

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,399
and cyber crime so both were doing this

224
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
and we also

225
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
moved

226
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
business to the home

227
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,279
right and this was something that was

228
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,880
done globally

229
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
now during that time i had 50 students

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
that were meant to be working with

231
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
industry two days a week

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,000
who suddenly couldn't go

233
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
so

234
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
we decided what could we do

235
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
as a community service in cyber security

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,800
so we divided the students up and did

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,760
two things half the students worked with

238
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,279
high schools

239
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,760
and developed workshops for teachers and

240
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,839
students in blockchain in behavior in

241
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,839
different cyber security

242
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
and the rest focus on small business

243
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,720
so

244
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,079
we had our students contact 30 small

245
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
businesses

246
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,079
and then we asked them three basic

247
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,079
questions

248
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,880
could they explain cyber security to us

249
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,399
very few could

250
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,480
okay they might understand one or two

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,079
concepts

252
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,800
we then ask them

253
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,920
do you know of any security controls

254
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
now remember

255
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,079
security controls have been developed in

256
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,399
countries globally for for over 15 years

257
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,959
and we only had

258
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,399
a paucity of people as in one

259
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,800
who could name more than one security

260
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
control

261
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,760
so can security trolls are

262
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,839
backing up

263
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,360
automatic updates

264
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,959
strong passwords

265
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,480
multi-factor authentication

266
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
and then when we took it one step

267
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
further

268
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
we asked them

269
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
did you implement any of them

270
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,519
and only one had so one out of 30 small

271
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,880
businesses

272
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,320
and so we were just fascinated by this

273
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
because while we knew cyber security is

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,720
probably weak in small businesses

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
we didn't know it was that weak

276
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,399
now

277
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,800
why is this important

278
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,839
because most cyber security attacks

279
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,800
can actually be stopped by implementing

280
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
eight security controls

281
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
and the other reason why it's important

282
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,880
is that a lot of cyber security attacks

283
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,079
are done

284
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,639
in the supply chain

285
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,519
with many of the supply chain being

286
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,360
small and medium-sized business

287
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
so governments are starting to realize

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
that this has been a neglected area

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
and so in our country tens of millions

290
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
of dollars have been released

291
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,480
in order to better secure smes

292
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
so what we also did is we had a look

293
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,160
at all of the training materials on

294
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
security controls for small business and

295
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
remember

296
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
this is important because most supply

297
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,639
chain

298
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,040
are in small business

299
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
so we analyze all of these materials

300
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,959
so the nist framework

301
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,320
in australia the asd essential 8

302
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,560
and the crest framework

303
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
and we took the recommendations for

304
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,240
small business

305
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
and

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
we analyzed the training materials

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,760
chose the best ones

308
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
and then we gave them to five small

309
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,480
businesses

310
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
to see if they could use the training

311
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,800
materials

312
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
to implement

313
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,240
one security control

314
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,200
not one small business could implement

315
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,920
the security control

316
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
based on the training material

317
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
even more

318
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
they all said they wouldn't

319
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
spend money on cyber security unless it

320
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,959
was about 200

321
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,000
and so we have so much to learn on the

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
behavioral side of things

323
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,279
right

324
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,880
so price wise behavioral economics

325
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
the behavioral

326
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,519
culture within an organization

327
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,519
so much behavioral research needing to

328
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,720
be done

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
and so

330
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,440
because of this project that we did

331
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,519
helping small businesses

332
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
we were very fortunate and the

333
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,800
government gave us a lot of money to set

334
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
up what we think is

335
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,600
the for the first university center

336
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
that is a live security operations

337
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
center

338
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,839
and

339
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,880
so it is a cyber incident response

340
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
center

341
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
run by experts

342
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
but utilizing

343
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,720
our students

344
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,279
so a hundred of our students will go

345
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
through this center every year

346
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,880
and they will provide free

347
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,320
incident response to small business

348
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
for ransomware

349
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
malware

350
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
data breach

351
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,199
and business email compromise

352
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,600
and so we've been very lucky and that

353
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,519
we've partnered with a number of

354
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
industry um associations

355
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
who are helping us to run this

356
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,079
these are just the ones below um that

357
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,560
are helping us we just got the funding

358
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,079
and we'll be opening uh in january it's

359
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,480
been a monumental effort

360
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
but we're hoping that this center

361
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,959
can go and be used

362
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
at any university in the world

363
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
afterwards

364
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,360
so we're making all of our

365
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
blueprints open

366
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,399
now you say why is this important

367
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,480
well in the 1930s the first legal aid

368
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,519
center opened up at a university

369
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,199
and almost every law school in the world

370
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
now has a free legal aid center

371
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,120
operating to train students and help the

372
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
vulnerable

373
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
we're hoping this center inspires a

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
whole new generation

375
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,720
of universities thinking that cyber

376
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,800
security advice also needs to be free

377
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
so let's talk about something a little

378
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
bit different

379
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
so i don't know if we have any

380
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,959
psychologists here

381
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,000
but this was a very famous experiment in

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
the 1970s

383
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
and it was called drunk tank pink

384
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,800
and it happened when

385
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
people would have too much alcohol to

386
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
drink and then they would become

387
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,399
obnoxious maybe violent and so the

388
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,199
police would pick up all of these people

389
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,759
and put them in jail overnight to let

390
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,440
the alcohol go out of their system

391
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
but because they were drunk there was

392
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,759
lots of fights and it was problematic

393
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
they found that if they painted jail

394
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
cells this particular color of pink

395
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,880
it reduced violence by 80

396
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,399
and so

397
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,560
for me i'm thinking

398
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,360
what

399
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
is the drunk tank pink

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
in cyber

401
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
so we're calling it

402
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,959
security activation

403
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,520
so at the moment what happens that the

404
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
studies show that

405
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
awareness training

406
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,439
doesn't work

407
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
so almost all money globally at the

408
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,039
moment

409
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,599
is being spent on awareness

410
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
right

411
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
everybody has a fishing exercise they do

412
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
at work

413
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
and it doesn't help because those

414
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
materials were based on fishing

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,160
materials from six years ago

416
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,799
i investigate cybercrime

417
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,840
cyber criminals are

418
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,320
smart the smartest person in the world

419
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,120
could not detect a fake phishing email

420
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
anymore

421
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,200
we're way beyond that

422
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
and so

423
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
what we're trying to do is do the

424
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
research to figure out

425
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
what works

426
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
what

427
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,880
empowers a business

428
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
to learn about cyber security

429
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
and then to feel

430
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,520
comfortable about exploring it more

431
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
to feel

432
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,559
they can take small steps

433
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
to implement it

434
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,440
and then have it actually become an

435
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
applied security control

436
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,160
that's run across the organization

437
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
and so

438
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
i think there's two things that are

439
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,080
going to be essential in this

440
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,919
one is going to be on cognitive

441
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,520
resilience

442
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
and the other is going to be on

443
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,080
behavioral data engineering

444
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,960
so behavior data engineering in cyber

445
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,760
security really is just a step in the

446
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
direction of lots of data analytics

447
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,400
applied to

448
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
data sets that we don't normally look at

449
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
in cyber security

450
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,360
so at the moment we don't analyze

451
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,120
behavioral aspects very much when we do

452
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
it tends to only be analyzing aspects of

453
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
fishing and fishing is only a small

454
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
aspect right in cyber security and so we

455
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
need to do a lot more research in this

456
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,880
area with industry

457
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
the second thing we need to do

458
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
is so the australian government

459
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,400
similar to japan just this week has

460
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
released the ransomware action plan

461
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,400
finally the governments have realized

462
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,360
that cyber security and cyber crime

463
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,280
needs to be coordinated by like-minded

464
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
states

465
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
it is not a problem you can solve

466
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
within your own country

467
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,440
because ransomware

468
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
is

469
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,559
organized crimes number one

470
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,360
profit at the moment

471
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,880
and it is also running the economy

472
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
in several nations

473
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
it's their first economic output

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
ransomware

475
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,559
this is crazy cyber security and cyber

476
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,280
crime are literally exploding off the

477
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
map

478
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,440
um

479
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
and for all of us who work in this field

480
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
we know how busy we are

481
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,440
i worked 100 hours last week because of

482
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
the insane amounts of cybercrime and

483
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,320
attacks coming in

484
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,480
so i'm very lucky in that i work for a

485
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
number of companies very par part-time

486
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,760
and

487
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
we do

488
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
cyber crime investigations

489
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
and so

490
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,960
four years ago we started to pay

491
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
informants

492
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
within organized cybercrime games

493
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,559
to feed us intelligence

494
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,960
and while i can't disclose where we're

495
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
working

496
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
what i can tell you

497
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,120
is how cyber criminals are organized

498
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,640
they have cyber crime universities

499
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,559
i kid you not

500
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,720
there is a university that looks like a

501
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
university but is only cybercrime

502
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,679
and its nickname the university of fraud

503
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,760
and they are running cryptocurrency

504
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
scams

505
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
24 7.

506
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,360
they train 100 people per week

507
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
and charge 1 000 u.s dollars

508
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
and when you exit their program with

509
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
your crime certificate

510
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,120
you then start perpetrating cyber crime

511
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,320
and so

512
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
are we producing

513
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,039
a hundred people per week

514
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
for a thousand dollars

515
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,960
to counter cyber crime no we're not

516
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
and so our even our behavioral economic

517
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,360
models in cyber security need to change

518
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
or we're not going to be um getting

519
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
around this problem anytime soon

520
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
so i haven't mentioned where our

521
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
informants are

522
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,000
because it would put their lives in

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,480
danger

524
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
the other thing is that i've yet to see

525
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,039
law enforcement outside of

526
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,640
the us

527
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
who truly have the expertise

528
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,280
to to tackle many of the issues that

529
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
we're seeing

530
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,000
um we do quite a bit of cryptocurrency

531
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,720
tracing at the moment and that's with

532
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
bespoke our research and development

533
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,679
and a couple of israeli products

534
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,640
and what we see is the following

535
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,679
there is no way any government is going

536
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,200
to be able to tackle cyber security and

537
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
particular cyber crime around crypto

538
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
without engaging private companies

539
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,440
it's just not going to be possible

540
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
for here and forever

541
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
because again

542
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
we need to scale right

543
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,240
scale from a few people to that model

544
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
where we're producing as many experts as

545
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
the as the criminals are

546
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,120
so

547
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
i'd like to leave lots of time for

548
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,440
questions

549
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,240
so

550
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
what i want you to do is think

551
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,880
what

552
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,840
is the safest mobile phone

553
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,918
so everybody have a thing

554
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
now i want you

555
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
to think why

556
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,520
you think it's the safest mobile phone

557
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,960
okay

558
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,240
everybody have their answer

559
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,000
so usually people might say oh it's the

560
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,159
iphone because i've heard it's more

561
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,120
secure

562
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,440
and it's true the iphone is infinitely

563
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
more secure than an android

564
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,919
i would never use an android in any

565
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,039
business

566
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,919
where i needed to be private and secure

567
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,919
because they don't do security testing

568
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,720
in the sandbox for their applications

569
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,159
but no

570
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,679
the iphone's not the safest safest phone

571
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,039
so

572
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,039
other people might say oh it's a really

573
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,960
old flip phone maybe

574
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
nokia or samsung

575
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
and you're like yeah okay that's a

576
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
really good answer because you know

577
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
nobody bothers with that anymore

578
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,120
possibly

579
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,640
others say it's a burner phone

580
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
could actually be

581
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,159
but if we're talking about smartphones

582
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,039
it's the microsoft phone

583
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,840
because nobody uses it

584
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
and while that's kind of funny

585
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
it's true

586
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
criminals and people who target you

587
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,080
they function based on behaviors

588
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
they're not going to write sophisticated

589
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
ransomware or malware

590
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,840
for a product that's not used

591
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
very much

592
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
because they would lose profit

593
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
they target the most important

594
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
security

595
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
devices coming onto the market

596
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,600
where they know for sure they can

597
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
maximize their profit

598
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,640
right

599
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,960
yeah in order to understand cyber

600
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,520
security you have to get behind the

601
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
mindset of those committing cyber

602
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,799
security

603
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,400
attacks

604
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,360
and so

605
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,200
what i can say

606
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,720
is that it's a very complex area

607
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,880
and that i'm probably doing more

608
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
political science

609
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
consultancy now that i've ever done

610
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
and

611
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,520
i'm actually really concerned for the

612
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,559
future

613
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,678
for the following reason

614
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,640
everybody is writing about zero trust so

615
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
they're trying to figure out and develop

616
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,440
applications technologies and devices

617
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
that trust nothing and no one they don't

618
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
trust the other device

619
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
and they don't trust the people in that

620
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,120
world

621
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,159
so while it's important that we develop

622
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,360
more secure products

623
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,080
the concept of zero trust

624
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
is something that i find

625
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,880
problematic

626
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,640
i do not want to live

627
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
in a world

628
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,240
with zero trust

629
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
it's sad

630
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,440
so in a world where you can't every time

631
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,400
you pick up your social media feed or

632
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,559
you look at the news

633
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,360
there's something about a cyber attack

634
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,120
cyber terrorism

635
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,520
and now with covet we've never seen more

636
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
cyber attacks than we've seen at the

637
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,880
moment

638
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,760
and then cyber information warfare

639
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,960
it is constant right with news and

640
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,000
industry but we have forgotten one

641
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,120
really important question

642
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
what does cyber peace look like

643
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
we need to start thinking of these

644
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
things

645
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,919
otherwise we're going to be a slave to

646
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,039
cyber security and perpetuity

647
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,120
and it's a world i don't want to live in

648
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,840
so

649
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
i'm sorry if this talk was a little bit

650
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
depressing

651
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,279
the good news is that look

652
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,360
teaching as many students as i do at the

653
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,559
moment

654
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,120
and many of you would as well

655
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,679
i can say that there aren't a lot of

656
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,080
senior people in cyber security but

657
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,880
there's a lot of really talented juniors

658
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
coming through that pipeline

659
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
and so i don't think it's always going

660
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,440
to be a rush

661
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,000
to catch up with cyber criminals

662
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
i think we're learning and getting

663
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,279
better as we go

664
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,159
but in order to do this well

665
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,399
we're going to have to collaborate much

666
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,640
much much more

667
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,159
and

668
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,720
governments and industry are going to

669
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,480
have to start to think in an agile way

670
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,440
and be open to changing quicker

671
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,039
because at the moment we're not so

672
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,720
on that note

673
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,600
thank you to the organizers and for all

674
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,120

694
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,840
try again sorry

695
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,559
okay

696
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,039
so that the probably that

697
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,760
there is some the kind of paradox if you

698
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,200
are using that

699
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,240
so the behavioral science into

700
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,760
information security area then probably

701
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
you can find us as a

702
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,600
holiday usual person

703
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,679
cannot uh

704
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,279
perceive the appropriate risk

705
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,399
of cyber security and privacy

706
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,640
and probably that uh

707
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
security industries

708
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
or the government

709
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
or law you have to uh something

710
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,360
uh to the just making the good

711
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,559
balance

712
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,600
of the

713
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
information security and the actual risk

714
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
so

715
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,399
when

716
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,799
you if you have some idea

717
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,320
about how to

718
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,440
get the optimal balance

719
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,840
of the such kind of risk

720
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,440
and social security activities please

721
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
let us know

722
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,840
about your idea

723
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,919
that is a

724
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,399
question

725
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,480
because balancing

726
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,679
is almost impossible

727
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
at the end of it you have to choose

728
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
as a society

729
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,039
and a business

730
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,760
which is more important

731
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,279
now

732
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,600
privacy and security

733
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,240
are highly related

734
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
and so you test

735
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,039
if you have

736
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,519
good privacy controls

737
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,600
often that will take effect

738
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,880
with good security controls

739
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
but should

740
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,919
be on the user

741
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,639
i think it's

742
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,679
the risk be

743
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,440
on the people

744
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,240
with the expertise

745
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,519
and so

746
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,480
we're starting to see a change

747
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,279
where internet service providers

748
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,200
for example

749
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,919
or banks

750
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,720
feel its difficulty

751
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,320
to assist

752
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,320
their customers with cyber attacks

753
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
are sponsoring our center

754
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,640
because

755
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,200
they have such high demand

756
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,799
from users

757
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
to learn more about cyber security

758
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,440
and they don't have a model to provide

759
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,399
thousands of hours of training to those

760
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,240
people

761
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,840
so

762
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,080
while they're good materials online

763
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,039
they're not always accessible

764
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,079
to people who start

765
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,079
and know nothing about cyber security

766
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,760
the one thing

767
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,719
we don't do well in society

768
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,159
is we move everything to a chat box

769
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,800
and automate everything

770
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
that's really many industries

771
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,280
it's terrible for cyber security

772
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,839
here's why

773
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,000
when you get hit

774
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
with a data breach

775
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,159
or ransomware

776
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,918
or business email compromise

777
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,440
you want a

778
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,000
human

779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,079
not a

780
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,359
so

781
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,879
what we find is clients will fall

782
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,240
and they'll be crying like literally

783
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,760
crying

784
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
ceos of businesses

785
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,079
realizing they've just sent 12.1 million

786
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,480
dollars

787
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,800
to a full supply chain provider

788
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,760
and so

789
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,599
there's this notion of shame

790
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,240
you know whether it's large business

791
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,079
or small business

792
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,560
or individuals

793
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,240
and what the message has to go out

794
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,000
that you should not be embarrassed

795
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
because this happens

796
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
and could happen

797
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,960
to anyone

798
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,319
i hope that's

799
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,640
if not

800
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,920
respond back

801
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
we can go from there

802
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,720
i i do a lot of work in privacy uh

803
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,399
engineering at the moment as well

804
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,839
okay thank you

805
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,520
[Applause]

806
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,280
all right

807
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,960
looking forward to coming to japan soon
