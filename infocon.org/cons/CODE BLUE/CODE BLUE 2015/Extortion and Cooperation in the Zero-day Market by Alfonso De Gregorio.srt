Dozo yoroshiku onegai shimasu everybody
thank you for the opportunity to speak

3
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:30,920
with you today it's a great honor to
have the privilege to address the esteem

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:40,190
gold blue audience to start with I would
like to pull your opinion and your

5
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:48,900
experience with 80 the market if you
feel inclined with riser and recognize

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,040
your view of many of you

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,680
stories of people or organizations who
burned in trading vulnerability

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,490
formation 40 day exploits anyone

9
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:18,380
and how many of you ever stories or be
trial the faction or extortion in the

10
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:29,100
secretive market and how many of you
expect to face any of these obstacles in

11
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,640
the future I do

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:43,479
is next all deals with such situations
and for those of you will never such

13
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:57,158
stories if everyone else I want to show
Jonathan Stewart as a freelance job a

14
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,900
family lives in a Phoenix suburb
featuring stucco houses a manicure arms

15
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:14,550
making 2013 after spending once more
days right moment

16
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:22,620
Jonathan was walking around on his own
when stumble into availability in Aus

17
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:33,080
Jonathan was security career is old
enough to remember when his colleagues

18
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,880
were being nothing more offer a tiny
talking about finding Willa Willa

19
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,079
abilities it right he has played for
them

20
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:51,829
tells about his discovery to be friends
because you know we can make some extra

21
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:58,910
cash from his work and already did so in
the past

22
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:08,680
guy is a boner ability broker word about
the Jonathan discovery from another

23
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,600
actor named jailed and who is in touch
with some businessmen in China the plan

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,930
is to take the Jonathan discovery let
george quite a spot for it and sell this

25
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:34,700
as a package deal to the Chinese
businessman meanwhile another group of

26
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,820
actors called the debaters third about
the same vulnerability and cut

27
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:51,209
$1,000,000 deal with a different group
of Chinese businessman general friend

28
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,300
got in touch with them in the open they
could all work together and you know

29
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,030
what

30
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:06,220
after turning down the Aviators go to
the finish line first figuring out how

31
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:15,900
to exploit the vulnerability and we need
to raise Jonathan never thought one of

32
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:26,900
France who told me to sell him out when
I found out we no rules no watchdogs no

33
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:36,020
court system to protect this discovery
Jonathan but used

34
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:44,159
that is to say that trading will be
deformation 40 days Lloyds is considered

35
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:54,319
a risky or players in the secretive 02
market face some obstacles related to

36
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,830
the time sensitiveness of trade
commodities frost rice burners

37
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:13,090
impossibility of the faction or to put
it succinctly this is a business

38
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:22,010
to begin with a bit information is a
time sensitive commodity beating cancer

39
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:44,060
in his clothes or a remediation is the
release the poor Brian sections should

close in a short time it would require
discretion for every day can be the last

41
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,510
day or a No day sale yet it is market
with no centralized way to locate its

42
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:10,599
players finding buyers and sellers can
be time consuming a major power market

43
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,910
participants web deals with individuals
you're not familiar with it was true

intentions are are to verified

45
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:30,219
furthermore even if buyers and sellers
managed to find each other really is

46
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:36,479
negotiating a fair price is often
challenging due to a lack of

47
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:46,599
transparency factors like the adoption
levels of the vulnerable component the

48
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:53,509
presence within a given a tax or face
the level authentication required to

49
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,919
exploit the vulnerability the difficulty
or independent rediscovery

50
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:07,589
exploit of liability another front doors
have any impact on the market price but

51
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:15,169
these factors are difficult to measure

52
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,698
the position of the security researcher
his partner impoverish by the tension

53
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,860
that exists between the amount of
information required to disclose and the

54
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:34,520
possibility of losing the intellectual
problem as it is for other information

55
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,229
goods proving the validity of
availability information without

56
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:48,150
disclosing it is challenging you're
essentially two possible approach reveal

57
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:57,909
or demonstrate in their both undecidable
if the seller reviews deformation before

58
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:07,490
and the possibility exists for a buyer
to exploit it without pay for it and

59
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,589
vice versa

60
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:14,509
decider might run away with the money if
the buyer pays sittin in a dance

61
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:24,029
demonstrating the validity of
availability we exploit is not any

62
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,479
better

63
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,289
Weber us full control over the computing
environment as an edge over the other

64
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:42,429
party if the demonstration is to be
carry out on the seller divisors it

65
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,399
becomes possible for the seller to
tamper with it

66
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:54,130
leaving the buyer in the position to be
unable to verify its integrity on the

67
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:00,779
other end if the demonstration is to be
carry out on the buyer equipment the

68
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:08,130
buyer may record the water slide into
still it

69
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:19,510
dwarfs any bullet ability claim can be
in short I believe about availability

70
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,670
from the side or the other party might
claim the same reliability as his own

71
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:36,310
and exploited as many of these deals are
international in our regulated it

72
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:44,050
becomes our to enforce the potential
conference finally the seller might be

73
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,750
interested to grant the exclusive rights
to the buyer in order to receive the

74
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:58,070
largest playoff but the seller made a
fact and sell the same intellectual

75
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:06,490
property to other buyers this time are
the buyer's to lack the means to protect

76
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:15,000
the south of course contracts may
include language the force the seller to

77
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,440
return to find to return the money if
the same not own or the contractor

78
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:31,400
obligation but in is eroding market the
difficulty to identify sellers to

79
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:39,110
attribute multiple transactions to the
same supplier it will force Congress at

80
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:49,820
the seller will lead to betray this are
obstacles the traditional business do

81
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,230
not have to face

82
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,490
in order to alleviate some of these are
knows it was suggested to use punishment

83
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,530
to discourage the buyer from the factory
were punishment can be understood as the

84
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:12,930
public disclosure obligations this
resort to the use of process the parties

85
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:20,260
as crucial entities for enabling the
cooperation market participants in a

86
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:28,050
simple which are escrow service or build
their reputation system for instance

87
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,319
reputation score as an instrument to
establish trust relationship between

88
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,560
distrustful players today I will tell
you about the first results all in one

89
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,170
study about extortion in a cooperation
in this year the market through the lens

90
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,199
of game theory theory is luring you
might say a price asleep because it's

91
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:02,600
boring I will produce so you don't have
to the questions

92
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,940
motivating this research are candidacy
ready market achieve cooperation in

93
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:16,870
efficacy even in absence or trust that
the parties can punishment discouraged

94
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:25,200
by from defecting under which conditions
the player can extort opponent can

95
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,000
corporation be sustained also fully and
I'm sightings in what about the same

96
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,640
anonymous economist told me address
these questions in orders by providing

97
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,420
trading strategies applicable to each
scenario now why I'm interested in all

98
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,040
of this

99
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:53,130
a white you may be interested as well I
work at intersections software security

100
00:12:53,130 --> 00:13:02,380
and security software exploring try to
contain the space or unanticipated state

101
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,060
the choice of my career was dictated by
dream I dream that software

102
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:15,439
manufacturers have the incentive to
build security into their products I do

103
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,830
the user's

104
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:25,520
instruments to education information
security risks they're exposed to a

105
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,590
dream that believability researcher
every fishing mean to capitalize on the

106
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:37,780
14 their security analysis essentially
dream that information symmetry is panel

107
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,750
established between buyers and sellers
in the security market but that's just

108
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,810
me i'm a dreamer the reality is that
current economic regulatory and legal in

109
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:58,819
centers are misaligned restore or
ineffectual what we serve today is not

110
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,530
economists call a market failure

111
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,680
any market failure is about the
inability to South correct software

112
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,719
manufacturers will know for gold market
shares Super User will know for go

113
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:24,540
features they translate into greater
complexity greater at AXA face

114
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,719
attackers will know for god sake then
millions of vulnerable systems out there

115
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:40,430
these markets how do we change I'm on
the record for funding be wise the first

116
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,979
information security prediction market
this wasn't my contribution towards

117
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:53,280
establishing the report instances while
I didn't succeed so far there is still

118
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,589
open me that we can improve our global
security posture and in order to

119
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,840
understand the market forces behind this
year the market needs for our community

120
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,560
i turn my attention to the dynamics of
this economy

121
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,859
understanding the emergence
sustainability a breakdown of

122
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:24,580
cooperation in this year the market is
increasingly important as our society

123
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:34,020
gross more interconnected it becomes
more interdependent we didn't south and

124
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,430
the more interdependence the greater the
larger the dynamic range of possible

125
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:47,410
failures and it comes as no surprise
that will rebuild information is key to

126
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,010
both offensive and defensive purposes

127
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,439
0 day exploit are gaining a prominent
role in national security

128
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,680
modern intelligence and law enforcement

intelligence community uses 0 dr king as
an alternative me to address their need

131
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:25,219
to access communications only later to
find out that those communities are

132
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,100
already knowledgeable about this craft I
don't need to be like sure about that

133
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,970
today

134
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,560
and the underground community as well as
as the information security defense

135
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,459
surveillance industries actually respond
that is to say that needs work

made in the shade or the future this is

the story of a dilemma faced by zero day
market participants were each given the

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,840
money split according to the proposal if
you rejects neither player receive any

150
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:21,620
money the prisoner's dilemma is
economical game study being a theory

151
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:28,299
that shows out to Puri Russian
individuals might not cooperate even if

152
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:33,629
it appears that the best interest to do
so

153
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:40,210
in the prisoner's dilemma to prisoner
commit a crime if they both do not

154
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,820
confess they get a low punishment if
they both can pass to get a more severe

155
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,399
punishment if one compares to other does
not

156
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,950
then they wonder confessed gets a barrel
of punishment yarder get a very severe

157
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:03,650
punishment they are traded prisoner's
dilemma is a repeat game where the

158
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:10,080
prisoner's dilemma game is the stage
game I didn't play the prisoner's

159
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,840
dilemma game an indefinite number of
times now in order to model 08 rates and

160
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,790
using a new game I called they all day

161
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:28,899
dilemma toward a dilemma works as
follows the reason is eerily seller and

162
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,510
the buyer if they both cooperate
respectively supplied is your day April

163
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:43,430
pay for the same they both received a
reward payoff are if they both the fact

164
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:50,850
respectively retaining the intellectual
property and the budget if both receive

165
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,459
a punishment be of be

166
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:03,029
if the buyer pays 40 day and the seller
and doesn't supply or undersupply done

167
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:12,899
by receive this sucker pay off as in the
cellar the temptation of the however if

168
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:18,219
the seller provides adizero day at the
buyer doesn't pay for it

169
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,640
three options becomes available to did
betray participant the seller may either

170
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:34,010
opt to a separate trial this scenario I
called submissive to be sure to perform

171
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:41,110
at retaliation a First Avenue or
retaliation is too close alternative the

172
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:50,149
earth with other buyers for the same 0
day let's call this scenario adopted a

173
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,719
second Avenue retaliation resembling the
doctrine of mutually assured destruction

174
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,909
is to publish the zero day and they get
its value to the spider minimizing the

175
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,960
window of opportunity associate with
this ploy to below the belt I call this

176
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:15,620
scenario any format both a match
retaliation approach work as long as the

177
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,539
believability splash

178
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:25,460
following relation between the payoff
that temptation payoff is strictly Gary

179
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,140
greater than they're worth of the reward
payoff is strictly greater than the

180
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,830
punishment of the office so strictly
greater than reporting of residual

181
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:44,340
payoff and expired playoff finally the
punishment payoff is strictly greater

182
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,549
than the soccer field

183
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:49,629
remarks

184
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,650
in the submissive scenario traders are
playing the standard prisoner's dilemma

185
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:01,980
the relationship or greater than pee in
price the mutual cooperation is superior

186
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,950
to mutual attraction but their
relationship the greater than our aim P

187
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,350
greater than ice implied that the
faction is the dominant strategy for

188
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:20,750
both factions or if action is better
than cooperation for one player no

189
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:28,700
matter what the other player me play in
the doubles scenario to media player nor

190
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,340
the seller abdominal strategy if it was
as if we assume they expire payoff to be

191
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,159
greater than the cycle payoff in the
refurbished pair of boobies noland a

192
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:46,140
reward payoff if they betray seller as
the ability to close our tentative deals

193
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:53,350
for the same exploit Sally one day and
attacked both or one day private exploit

194
00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:01,330
for instance then the faction would not
be a dominant strategy anymore but the

195
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:01,990
market

196
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:07,940
nature plays a role in this capacity
today nearly market is not a monopoly

197
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,060
and his weekly regulated but starting
from the implementation of the Boston or

198
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:20,940
arrangement new laws regulation may
emerging space and this will have any

199
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,920
impact on market liquidity

200
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,790
demand scenario is a variant of the
standard prisoner's dilemma where the

201
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:36,950
seller is the ability to negate the
buyer the temptation to the fact he does

202
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:45,420
so by making sure the temptation of
approach the punishment bills and the

203
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,840
perception is not a dominant strategy
for the buyer now if factors such as the

204
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,070
market liquidity export trade
regulations mean time to close a deal

205
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:05,189
prevent the adoptive retaliation
approach from being undertaken than the

206
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:13,130
seller should consider disclosing
publicly displayed or availability by

207
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,530
doing so she will not make yourself
worse off she was going to get the

208
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,240
soccer playoff anyway

209
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,950
Ricky either pretty the other way around

210
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:32,400
she will reduce the buyer incentives to
the fact on the first place but it isn't

211
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,890
it's important for his zero reseller web
inefficient me for doing full disclosure

212
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:46,940
I say full disclosure or not for the
sake of bragging rights anymore but for

213
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:54,890
modern-day bring mission in fact a
Sportster disclosure vulnerability are

214
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:03,850
shorter the window of opportunity to the
spider in the smaller the residual now

215
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,980
since July 2002 the full disclosure
least experienced a fair share of legal

216
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,340
trouble selling the way

217
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:21,299
and the market will likely witness more
laws or regulations both may translate

218
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:29,870
OPSEC fail or if they don't even notice
a meter is not protect or which is to

219
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,020
say that I would not be surprised to
learn about a new day disclosure

220
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:42,418
platform researcher could use it for
doing full disclosure players in this

221
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:50,029
market could use it to retaliate against
the buyer who the fact insiders would

222
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:54,610
turn to it puts pose a security of trade
in intrusion is surveillance

223
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:05,209
technologies that it yesterday or 0 recs
if you like to note that as long as the

224
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,190
seller doesn't play the submissive
scenario they buy is no better off

225
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,049
defecting therefore in the one-shot
sequential Zelda game corporation is

226
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:24,059
possible if the seller must retain the
ability to punish the by all the facts

227
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:32,279
if this is not the case then the russian
Prime is the action profile of mutual

228
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,549
defection middle and modern is that
mutual cooperation yes a better outcome

229
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:45,110
the mutual attraction but is not the
rationale of gun because the choice to

230
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:50,719
cooperate at individual level is not
rational promised a field west point of

231
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,460
view

232
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:59,990
therefore I want to ask you if no form
of punishment can be undertaken by the

233
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,559
seller can be cooperative outcome will
still be sustained as an equilibrium

234
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:12,289
they are directed toward a dilemma is a
repeat game word or deed alignment is

235
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:18,370
the State game wardens played all day
dilemma game an indefinite number of

236
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:26,270
times now whenever the submissive
scenario applies the I directed toward a

237
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:31,610
dilemma reduced to the wider aided
prisoner's dilemma therefore it becomes

238
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,820
possible to tap into the extensive
theoretical and experimental literature

239
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,789
devoted to the study or repeat games in
to draw some predictions on the

240
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:51,629
emergence sustainability and breakdown
of cooperation in this year the market I

241
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:57,809
ask you to consider three major
sightings the only inciting were traders

242
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:06,080
know the identity of the party they are
dealing with their anonymity citing were

243
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,799
breeds takes place among strangers and
they see me an online setting were

244
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:21,520
either the buyer or a seller is
anonymous since their over all my work

245
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,780
my machine 1959 it has been well known
in the autonomous acting to rational

246
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,940
individuals facing each other an
indefinite number of times can sustain

247
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,730
the cooperative outcome presently will
impress in Freeman Dyson changed a

248
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,000
viewpoint in this game

249
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,289
illustrating the power granted to a
sentient player or a player with the

250
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:58,860
theory of mind if we remind is a poetic
way to say that the player realized that

251
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:06,459
their behavior can have any influence on
the planning strategies present I soon

252
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:14,909
introduce a new class of strategies 20
determine strategies in able to enforce

253
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:19,830
illegal relationship between the two
players course

254
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:31,000
0 determine strategies have far-reaching
consequences 0 day traders if one trader

255
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,169
is a were 10 determine strategies by the
opponent is an evolutionary player then

256
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:44,690
the former can choose to extort the
larger a player is said to be

257
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:52,460
evolutionary if she possesses no theory
of mind and simply seek to adjust their

258
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:58,440
strategy to maximize their own score in
response to whatever the adversaries

259
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:06,399
doing extortion strategies want a
disproportionate number or type of food

260
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:14,260
extortion is too expensive the victim
but it's the B team best interest to

261
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:19,760
cooperate with extortion is because
she's able to increase their score by

262
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:27,769
doing so but in so doing she will end up
increasing the extortion score even more

263
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:34,389
than their own now be king will never
catch up to the extortionist issue with

264
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:42,580
a seat where nichols case or to do so
here we are an example for an

265
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:49,750
extortionist strategy right into the
player X three times the sheriff of a

266
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:57,110
both punishment then those rewarded to
the opponent why but how does it work in

267
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:04,289
practice in practice if we assume the
war temptation punishment is soccer

268
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:06,490
playoff to beat respectively

269
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:13,840
23510 know if we assume

270
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,750
I was a extortionist player you were an
evolutionary one I could play this game

271
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:28,240
with you if we both operate less time
than I cooperate with probability 11

272
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:37,470
over 30 if I cheated on you last time I
cooperate with probability seven over 26

273
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:47,750
cheated on me last time I could hear it
again with probability one off if we

274
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:54,779
both the fact I will defect in this way
on average on the long run my score 2-1

275
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:02,679
would be pricier score 2-1 I would I
refer you to date paperboard indicates

276
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:10,919
president also show that if both players
are sent into in only one is

277
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,559
knowledgeable about 20 determine
strategist than they are decorated the

278
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,350
prisoner's dilemma reduced to the
ultimatum game that supposed both

279
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:27,600
players are sentient but only the buyer
is knowledgeable about zero determine

280
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:38,010
strategies for the buyer may decide to
extort the seller but the seller will

281
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,559
eventually noticed that something is
amiss because whenever she tries to

282
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,590
improve your score

283
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:55,389
synapse improving the buyer score even
more than their own if you remind the

284
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,570
seller may eventually decide to sabotage
discoverable

285
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,080
she does so they are they traded
prisoner's dilemma reduced to the

286
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,090
ultimatum game by are proposing an
affair ultimatum and the seller

287
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,959
responding by either accepting or
rejecting the proposal

288
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,620
finally present doesn't show that if
both players are sentient and

289
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:26,389
knowledgeable about 20 determine
strategies then they can agree on

290
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:33,320
playing what they call a generous 0
determine estrategias impart any

291
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,639
tentative to extort opponent will result
in low pay off for both the port the

292
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,230
rational thing to do is to agree on a
fair operations strategy and they can do

293
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:53,250
so by unilaterally citing opponents
strategies of all agree upon that you

294
00:33:53,250 --> 00:34:00,100
possibly the maximum possible whenever
they do so neither player can improve

295
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,408
your score by violating the strategy and
each is Spanish for any purely malicious

296
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:11,730
violation similarly to what we sell for
next orson strategy here we have a

297
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:17,500
generous strategy right into the player
acts to time stepping off they both

298
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:27,050
reward those awarded to the point why in
practice if we assume the same pay off

299
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:33,280
as we did before two players
knowledgeable about 20 determine

300
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:43,500
strategies who follow these rules if
they both cooperate last time than the

301
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,760
will keep operating if the axe cheated
on why less time than acts cooperate

302
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:58,120
with probability 8 overtime if why
cheated on max less time than X

303
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,540
cooperates agreeing with probability
three overtime and if they both the fact

304
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,690
X will cooperate but with probability to
overtime on average on the long run the

305
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:16,210
score of Acts mines three will be twice
the score of why ministry but all the

306
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,400
results

307
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,050
sided so far applies only when the
market participants have the ability to

308
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:31,400
identify charter identification is
required to describe past action to the

309
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,610
same market participants in to choose
strategies according to the outcome of

310
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:43,600
past interactions but nowadays we know
that there are a number of black markets

311
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,270
where traders are anonymous

312
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:54,750
therefore it's natural to ask its
cooperation possible in an unnecessarily

313
00:35:54,750 --> 00:36:02,660
markets you believe it is if yes which
institution for monitoring and

314
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:10,750
enforcement promote cooperation in
deciding experimental study on anonymous

315
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,280
economies global economy remarkable
Saudi found out that cooperation is i

316
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,080
increase with experience but also notice
a low degree of cooperation when subject

317
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,190
see aggregate of time without observing
identities as might result from

318
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:35,180
discussing trading experience on an
audience for

319
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,109
more interestingly they observed that
the costly personal punishment

320
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:47,029
significantly promotes cooperation in
experimental treatment subjects were

321
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,290
given the possibility to observe action
coming the game

322
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:59,869
18 feet at a cost a loss in the earnings
of the defect important to america sorry

323
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:04,829
disobey idea second stage two day one
shot game in the second stage

324
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:12,349
retaliations stage resembling food
adopted the Med scenarios in their

325
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:20,819
ordeal and therefore they result applies
in our citing this year the market in

326
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:26,029
the same treatment players were observed
opponent the fact sometimes employed

327
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:31,380
personal punishment which is to say you
met retaliation we're staying

328
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:38,589
cooperative mode in the four-week period
and they collected extensive evidence

329
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:44,520
showing that players show preference for
a match retaliation over important

330
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,650
retaliation and this form of punishment
was found to be all set patient impact

331
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,299
the factors would be punished by the
operator were more likely to cooperate

332
00:37:56,299 --> 00:38:03,030
in the following periods for personal
punishment can be understood as a public

333
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:10,319
good on the 19 is significantly increase
cooperation on the other the subject to

334
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,690
benefit the most

335
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:18,740
park operators to punish little or not
at all now for the sake of completeness

336
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,270
let's turn our attention to save me

337
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:29,420
anonymous 20 the markets this is a
trading scenario documented by the

338
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,930
summer hockey team leagues

339
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:41,808
according to the leaked documentation to
daily correspondence the chief

340
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:49,010
technology officer and co-founder of the
medium base company was approached

341
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:58,290
backing 2014 by in a 90 day seller
proposing a Windows local previous the

342
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:06,009
local privilege escalation exploit a
some research services called upon the

343
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,940
chief technology officer for any opinion
the chief operation officer recommended

344
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:19,420
against closing any deals with anonymous
individuals area fear that accreditation

345
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,809
is of essence therefore I want to ask
you was the chief operation officer

346
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:35,770
impression right cannot trust announced
a sailor's if you were in the place we

347
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:42,140
have trusted seller with supplying all
day my answer to these questions are a

348
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:49,308
corollary to the analysis able
essentially if one party's anonymous the

349
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:56,510
only US counterpart has no ability to
know if she already had any deals with

350
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:02,380
the same participant before the latter
can benefit from the sentence and is

351
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,420
forced to choose strategies as an
evolutionary players would do

352
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:15,250
this means that the anonymous party if
the party is knowledgeable about 20

353
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:21,250
determine strategies can choose to
extort your opponent and is terribly

354
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,850
interesting because show while
cooperation in emerging economies

355
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:35,360
extortion can proliferate in simi
announced markets all which is to say

356
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,120
that the intuition by the chief
operation officer in nineteen team was

357
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:45,509
quite alright the for today I have some
good news

358
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:52,140
a cautionary note is some recomendation
20 day traders these are Nikki take away

359
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:59,980
I would like to leave you with today so
please bear with me one minute longer to

360
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,970
sum up their 0 the market can achieve
cooperation even in absence of processor

361
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:12,680
parties even in absence of escrow
service corporation can be sustained

362
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,710
even when traders are anonymous

363
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:20,990
that's remarkable a punishment is an
effective instrument to discourage

364
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:27,029
traders from the factory but be careful
because it's possible to get texts or if

365
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:33,580
the adversary knows about zero day
strategies and we simply seek to adjust

366
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:42,120
our strategy to maximize our own profit
therefore my recommendation by six

367
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:49,350
recommendation to all day traders are
the following first do not deal with an

368
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:57,220
ounce traders if you cannot assure your
own anonymity

369
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:03,589
second discouraged if action by
practicing brinkmanship forecasting the

370
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:11,170
shadow of the future in every decision
or your counterpart third consider

371
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,109
punishing the faction to promote
cooperation the seller can do so by

372
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:28,310
closing alternative deals or publishing
2004 let the seller supply W 51st if

373
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,840
interest in one-time deal

374
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:39,060
learn about the relatedness strategist
if play in a market of course it seeks

375
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:45,200
forever defect if you see the faction
while playing in an anonymous market and

376
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,109
have no ability to punish the point
that's pretty much it as far as your

377
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:58,230
egos in order to put this recommendation
of fairness scientific grounds

378
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:07,680
experimental verification need to be
carry out so please be in touch before

379
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:19,819
wrapping up one last remark to me and I
would like to close within 72 in the

380
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,690
death of me sorry there is still garners

381
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:31,000
army in music inside me now if you like
me

382
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,530
believed dead in security or the
presence of mitigate double surprises is

383
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:44,450
the misery of our time if you like me
believe that insecurity is the misery of

384
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:50,740
our time and at the same time you like
me are also sanguine about our ability

385
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:57,618
to attain better security threat of it
to give to our children the chance to

386
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:03,069
reach confidence in the process to which
they will entrust their business

387
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:07,839
then we can part of racism and goggles
said that too we are opening the death

388
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:17,069
of insecurity there is still down here
are many a music inside us thank you

389
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:28,670
hello have you ever bought an all day
before have you ever so in order before

390
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:35,440
or have you ever broker a deal before I
facility some deal so you broke up

391
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,329
before speaking with first-hand
knowledge of how the oil market is

392
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:44,599
working I some first-hand experience
with this

393
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:52,079
that's quite alright but my spirits can
be partially because anyway very limited

394
00:44:52,079 --> 00:45:00,329
so I tried to draw some prediction using
a theoretical framework and also to

395
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:06,949
reconcile this pretty chick with some
other experiences cool collected from

396
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:11,910
the field so you're you're companies
involved in the OJ trading business

397
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:23,920
somehow no I work in IT Engineering
security products already on your own

398
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,529
individual effort this was a journalist
Peters

399
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:54,050
ok expert west

400
00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:20,930
different sensibilities towards ethical
issues I believe that while ethical

401
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:28,040
issues need to be discussed more openly
widely at the same time we need to

402
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:36,430
address the security is seduced into
this market because as long as there

403
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:42,859
will be some markets out beating are
there will be purchasing problems like

404
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:51,120
bug bug bounty programs there will be a
sizable sexual sizable part of our

405
00:46:51,120 --> 00:47:00,410
community sailing their information they
0 day exploit for profit so in order to

406
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:08,930
let son dynamic something ominous
emerged we need to make sure to delete

407
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:17,250
address ethical issues in my 22 provide
a satisfactory solution to this but the

408
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:24,990
line also the economics of information
security market so right now I'm study

409
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:30,229
all of these in order to focus more
specifically on economics leaving the

410
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,480
legal issues too

411
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:59,760
other entities US market I tried to

412
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:12,560
fortunately the data set of public
experience is quickly narrow so my

413
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,910
presentation by name a few

414
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:20,230
Charlie Miller experience documented in
the workshop only economics information

415
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,840
security in 2007

416
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,700
Jonathan Stewart raced to exploit aus

417
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:34,799
also day I can t miss appearance in with
a 9-0 they sell in all these experiences

418
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:42,510
are consistent with theoretical
predictions and I also had some exposure

419
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:51,190
in private to some for other traits that
reflects also his prediction but I mean

420
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,410
that the city's anyway so small that

421
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:06,950
I cannot tell a girl say that you feel
my my model it's a model so can be

422
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:17,098
somewhat right but it can have also some
forces some limitations sure enough for

423
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:22,900
either couldn't fall all the other
models and simulations sparked it seems

424
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:31,690
to me that one part is missing which is
dealing with different say value of the

425
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:39,250
exploits like you can be selling cheap
or easy exploits and you get i mean

426
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:46,059
trust by somebody and then you can
defeat on the big exploit so if you are

427
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:52,309
thinking only about anonymous market
this kind of doesn't apply so much but

428
00:49:52,309 --> 00:50:00,829
any any of the other scenarios this is
actually a lot really thanks for passing

429
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:02,900
this is true

430
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:12,940
some nowadays unfortunately we are toxic
face growing larger and larger we have a

431
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:19,260
plan to build is ready to be deployed so
we will be always said it

432
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:26,089
oversupply of bugs to be exploited for
profit and this means that some really

433
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:32,779
skilled talent to researcher can trade
routes and build a reputation in the

434
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,500
market

435
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,750
return not anonymous only later to
benefit from good reputation burn it in

436
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:48,260
order to the South Bay I never heard
about any of this story so far but we

437
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,470
know be surprised

438
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:58,040
about this because it's a matter of
profit if the incentives

439
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,599
economic incentives line and we are
witnessing prices in the marketed under

440
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:10,410
increasing more and more sooner or later
this may eventually at the so thanks war

441
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:18,848
over marketing display

442
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:28,020
thank you very much we still have some
time left I okay the middle blocker the

443
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,800
person in the first place well thank you
very much for the interesting

444
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,710
presentation

445
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:45,500
vulnerability cutie then there will be
free of charge so I was provide that

446
00:51:45,500 --> 00:52:01,509
developing company where the impact on
the market but I think

447
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:11,249
while my prison in some of the players
in the market place there's some they

448
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:18,598
identified availability and they give it
for free of charge so I'm sure

449
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,439
information

450
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:27,348
value decreases if they do that if they
provide a free of charge so I'm sure I'm

451
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:31,009
sure there's some impact on this kind of
money market how do you know I start

452
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,429
thanks for your question

453
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:39,549
destroyed there are some markets
especially some regions of the globe

454
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:45,189
where the payoff for the availability
researchers is not only financial but

455
00:52:45,189 --> 00:52:50,670
comes from essentially recognition by
the community

456
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:57,310
in those cases especially not really
critical vulnerabilities can be

457
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:02,680
disclosed for free in order to gain some
exposure became a bookstore maybe landed

458
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:11,470
a new job this absolutely true at the
same time it's true also that whenever I

459
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:16,790
speak with friends and colleagues in
countries were disputing market is

460
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:25,300
pretty immature they are ready to
consider this option in order to make

461
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,880
career in the field but when I speak
with other friends from countries were

462
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,100
industrial is not so well that the
battle and where the opportunities to

463
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:43,950
learn new job is no so they go after the
financial reward they go after first

464
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:52,720
after they fuck financial so this true
and what you say is also fortunate

465
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:01,149
because whenever the supplies we can run
either will be markets such as fuck but

466
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:05,770
bounty programs in order to invite
security researcher to disclose

467
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:11,220
vulnerabilities but sometimes will

468
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:18,419
purchasing programs but bounty programs
are outbid by this year the market and

469
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,410
there are there is a sizable part of our
community

470
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:27,690
trading with those entities doctors we
should align incentives in order to make

471
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:33,660
sure that more palatable diskette
disclosed reported and fixed in a timely

472
00:54:33,660 --> 00:55:17,640
way

473
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:45,200
impact financially boat on companies
that are traded publicly whether I was

474
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:52,390
surprised and was forced to reconsider
my position by the recent experience in

475
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:57,629
the security market way were some data
breaches were reported according to some

476
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:02,450
additional loans for instance in the
United States were you need to report

477
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:07,450
any breach to their properties and the
market price of those companies let's

478
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:14,970
say target for instance was local impact
in the first day but it's true also that

479
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:22,029
the same time to recover quickly and
regain its position right after so

480
00:56:22,029 --> 00:56:29,019
nowadays at the end of the day I'm not
really persuaded that security incidents

481
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:32,740
are highly consider by

482
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:39,830
investors especially if they're not able
to make a save significant dent into the

483
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,299
financial so the companies in the long
run
