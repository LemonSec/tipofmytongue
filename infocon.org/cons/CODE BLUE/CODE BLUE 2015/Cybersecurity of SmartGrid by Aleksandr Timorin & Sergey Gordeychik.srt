1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:31,580
and now to speak on the health or SCADA
strangelove security team in birkenau

2
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,379
three or four different security
companies but here to introduce

3
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:48,318
collective efforts to boost security
industrial control system and this is a

4
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:55,640
list of participants of Scott estranged
wife team and I would like to ask you to

5
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:10,210
give your big hands for all guys who
were together we thank you

6
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:28,380
become much better since 2010 we advance
tax warm was introduced it but we need a

7
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,990
lot of efforts to make more secure
industrial control system today we will

8
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,310
speak about power about electricity and
I think it's very important here in

9
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:52,020
Japan because as you can see Japan its
number five is the least of power

10
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:05,060
producers in the power grids shows
moderate concept what is Margaret the

11
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:14,220
half water sources of energy and we had
a lot of customers who get energy and

12
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:24,769
use it or where needs and number of
generators consumers become more and

13
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:33,690
more and we need a weary sophisticated
system which you interconnected shower

14
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,380
and exchange information about number of
energy generated and consumers why

15
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,450
because we need to cover the cannot
store electricity likely cannot likely

16
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,600
can store for instance oil we need
generated instantly and instantly

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:02,420
concealment so in first part of our talk
with you speak about communication

18
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:13,779
issues and issues related to customers
or green energy sources of electricity

19
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:24,920
we decided to go deeper into this kind
of systems to go deeper in our resort

20
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:33,060
was based on the joke the internet
especially entry terror and there was a

21
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:41,430
joke about worries that light source is
lost forever in solar plans to announce

22
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:51,260
and next was that we find out that most
TV plants based on the system called

23
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,109
system-on-chip one of the most

24
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:02,890
widely spread system is called IDC cheap
well is it uses Sirius realtime

25
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:11,329
multitasking operations system with PHP
strict protocols with popular serious

26
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:19,700
like that and it's consistent uses some
kind of security protocols but we find

27
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,760
out is it simply through the entire
peace without authentication we can

28
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,370
download chip configuration script

29
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:37,400
well one of the system based on a PC a
cheap solar lock system by solar look

30
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:50,070
when there and uses it uses a connection
from inverter so world wide spread and

31
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:57,180
aggregate information about distributed
energy on investors and simply

32
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:08,790
overlooked systems can use in about 1
million in the rich world by trade for

33
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,880
example in germany you can see the map
all the connected to the Royal Oak

34
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:24,440
PCCHIPS system devices just simply for
germany well how to find out the devices

35
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,370
well first approach is very simple just
simply using Google Docs and

36
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,510
we can find out Google direct from some
configuration scripts but moreover we

37
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:43,820
can use it freely available and using
the simplest drinks we can find out who

38
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:53,000
directs over logs and simple doing
search Google can see that about 65,000

39
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,800
of other local artists connected to the
web and uses sorry and connect to the

40
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,850
web and Google know about it

41
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:14,250
well brief overview of the web interface
give us the ability without its a very

42
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,460
important head without authentication to
download configuration of the solar

43
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,729
system configuration is system because
well the brief overview of system become

44
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:34,099
give us some kind of encryption of the
user passwords but as you know and

45
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:42,980
it's not just simple encryption in just
simple soaring well as one findings in

46
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:52,790
the film where was that we simply sleep
in looking at the HTTP request we can

47
00:06:52,790 --> 00:07:02,770
see that we can simply replace system
any system file folder Lock well we

48
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:10,430
coordinated be certain boomed and this
lunar abilities was fixing things went

49
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:18,850
well another one popular solar system
it's by Germany render is me a sunny

50
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,550
books and simply using short-term into
Google and under caution if we can find

51
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:34,460
out about 80,000 devices connected to
the web just only for europe countries

52
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,849
well

53
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:45,680
findings was about four years ago and it
was very popular vulnerability for this

54
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,070
kind of devices default password well it
was a smear passport applications but

55
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,639
when we take a look

56
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:03,280
the official documentation for signing
books system we find out another one

57
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,159
default passwords it's it's me lover
crease well okay it's just the only pour

58
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:16,879
installer well I think occasion process
for signing books based only on past but

59
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,560
without the username and based on the
past 40 signing books give you kind of

60
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,930
role like user and installer well next
one finding someone it's not only a

61
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:39,820
small upper case and lower case the
fourth person but only but also 407 414

62
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:49,420
user and installer usergroups ok so we
decided to go deeper and observed

63
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,160
solar arrays tiny bugs applications and
find out

64
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:03,819
left like part of light hits it has not
only user and installer roles but also

65
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,850
serious and developer for whatever
reason to have this kind of fraud and

66
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:16,720
another one interesting findings was
possible modes like how could it

67
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:29,790
TV what does it mean I think you should
know about it so past 14 sunnybear box

68
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:40,019
art called it very hard but how much
energy we can control his weight is

69
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:51,820
simple when their abilities their main
page or device shows the number of

70
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:59,190
energy produced by TV plans so using
Google cash we can get in trouble this

71
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:05,370
information and can calculate amount of
energy generated by the greed of such

72
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:14,370
devices so he able to extract from
Google information about 100 of

73
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:23,209
megawatts of innocence power if you
compare this amount of energy be four

74
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:29,790
different sources it's like a small he
dropped my Electra stationed somewhere

75
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:42,980
out so not so many but let's speak about
win because if solar panels consume all

76
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:50,899
the Sun in two mins consumed all the
wheels and its command disaster so we

77
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:59,130
decided to save universe again simple
shirt and briefs

78
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:13,380
able to find about 500 or devices and
Nordics and see through portal which

79
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,760
have a long history of vulnerabilities
but still connected to internet you can

80
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:33,370
see what was found in 2010 but the root
problem with this system what this basic

81
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:43,550
weary all web server so it's around web
server version number free actual

82
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:53,349
version is number nine so job and
several it does not supported by

83
00:11:53,350 --> 00:12:03,560
manufacturers already but it still used
by the system so you can find a roto

84
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,189
bilities and you can find the world of
exploit which can be used it to bypass

85
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:19,360
protection and the get out enough
indicated access to such systems these

86
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:31,430
regions between and within FIFA TV plans
you work for basic device so you have

87
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:38,420
solar panel you have investor you have
management system and software we've

88
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:47,860
sent you have a mechanical system you
have engines you have breaks you have a

89
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:57,800
generator and if you can manage breaks
or engine you can use it to make a

90
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,490
physical disaster so

91
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:08,470
instrument from a security point of view
or safety point of view I think physical

92
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,750
safety much more dangerous

93
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:21,800
solar ok how much energy we can manage
in this case again

94
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,740
route page all the Nordics in situ
portal shows us amount of energy

95
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,070
generated by the system and the gain
instructed to this information from

96
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:43,570
Google cache the able to find about 1
gigawatt of Houston's power company

97
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:51,460
involved different sources it's the same
amount which generated by nuclear power

98
00:13:51,460 --> 00:14:00,260
plant in bushehr which was impacted by
Stuxnet worm so to break into bushehr

99
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:08,050
secret service of different countries
prepare it very sophisticated target and

100
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:16,510
malware to manage same amount of wind
power you need only wearing simple

101
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:23,780
public vulnerabilities and you can find
affected system we have Google scary

102
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:38,870
part where he where is simple
vulnerabilities be able to find a way to

103
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:48,620
control about 80 gigawatts of power it's
like number five

104
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,860
crustacean largest either elect
restoration in the world in Brazil so

105
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,010
it's good amount of energy

106
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:13,810
time finding clothes presented at CCC
cows Communication Congress confidence

107
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:22,449
in Germany and based on feedback we
decided to establish Karda si OS project

108
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:30,500
it's open project and everybody can
contribute it and the main goal of this

109
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:38,980
project to find devices power grid
devices is the internet to find

110
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,310
insecurities and to inform vendors and
computer emergency response team about

111
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,800
such issues

112
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,609
here's example of contributors

113
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,210
information about insecurity to be in
consideration about hardcoded passport

114
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:11,000
again and this information was shared
computer emergency response team and

115
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,110
sexual abilities will fix it by the
vendor also as one of result able to

116
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:30,750
force lenders to disconnect about 65,000
of smart grid devices from the internet

117
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:41,420
because you know awareness work if you
can so you have 25,000 of your customers

118
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,280
which can be immediately hearted by
schoolboy please care about your

119
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,660
customer

120
00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:01,410
makes point its global radio network and
why is Global Radio Network so important

121
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:14,629
radio network now use it everywhere in
ATMs in Cardiff in our everyday lives

122
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,990
but Iranian authorities where huge
attacks or phrase so you cannot target

123
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:28,280
area different factor now its uses
tcp/ip protocol so you can use your

124
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:36,510
favorite attack to keep to find an
expert vulnerability and what's

125
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,070
important

126
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,419
its global so if you have further
ability

127
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:51,210
Mumbai area of someway NUS you can use
me sooner abilities to exploit my bike

128
00:17:51,210 --> 00:18:02,740
carrier in Japan why because it's
interconnected let's give an example one

129
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,000
of the simplest way to find twelve
durability seen mobile carrier network

130
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,780
its its use of her abilities of IP boxes
of five-year-old tools like gigi is just

131
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:26,840
because in general it's IP devices under
management interfaces and you can find

132
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,750
on security interfaces like something P
etcetera and exploited sometimes

133
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:45,890
customers use private 8 p.m. AP and its
connection stream for GPRS which

134
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,180
well-known

135
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:54,580
different carrier but sometimes you can
use private API which uncle know and

136
00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,699
many people believe with these kind of 3
p.m. but in general this is wrong

137
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,980
8 p.m. can be easily guess it

138
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:10,000
and use it with private collection
stream you can get access to different

139
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:21,919
IP connection we are mobile network in
our prime its 4G redo security already

140
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:29,330
clear if you believe what current level
of encryption for LT is okay so

141
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:38,750
outsiders strong encryption
authentication but on practice areas

142
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:46,500
support backward compatibility to gene
networks so if you can mound when the

143
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:55,280
media dock so if you can be plagued by a
station you can downgrade of medication

144
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:06,610
and encryption level and intercept any
communication more customers know on

145
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:18,689
sista see demonstrated in many countries
increased ship is prohibited by law

146
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:27,230
so even food unit work arounds
unencrypted but in many countries even

147
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:35,690
if encryption is a lawyer who jean
chretien only is prohibited

148
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:42,390
why because secret services need have
ability to downgrade encryption level

149
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:52,990
2004 interception to markets bad guys
terrorist etc but our guys can use these

150
00:20:52,990 --> 00:21:00,530
ability to downgrade encryption level
and intercepted communication another

151
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:08,899
interesting point it was presented here
in Japan last year its advanced it

152
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,990
vulnerable 'tis

153
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,470
SIM cards I think you know what seems
card in the computer

154
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:23,409
running Java so if you can find
vulnerability in application running on

155
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,030
the cheap

156
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:32,678
you can use it and explode and it was
demonstrated how we are special crafted

157
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:42,539
SMI says you can obtain encryption keys
and Tim C which store on their SIM card

158
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:50,150
or even installing special crafted
malware special corrupted pro-jobs job

159
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:59,650
are played on the SIM card which will
soon wife my handset changing so if you

160
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,429
change your form and install be SIM card
from different phone you still will be

161
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:14,130
in fact another one more very
interesting area of security research

162
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:23,669
security of femtocell what is found
herself a cell is a small brown bike but

163
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:31,110
station Mumbai base station which you
can be used to extend coverage so you

164
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:41,449
can install them to sell in with room to
have good coverage but in most cases so

165
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,409
just a Linux box if you can root it you
can intercept phone communication

166
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:57,380
between him and my balcony area so you
can mount man in the middle attack for

167
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:04,929
3G and 4G network because all
communication if you be decrypted want

168
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:12,260
to talk so radio communication you can
intercepted and I'll after encrypted and

169
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:20,000
proving IPSec tunnel submit to my bike
carrier it was presented in different

170
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,220
conferences for insulting where had you
as 2050

171
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:33,059
another interesting topic presented by
our team its vulnerabilities in 4G

172
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:40,020
modems it's very common device you can
plug into your laptop and get access to

173
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:49,370
internet but in most cases putting more
than it's very sophisticated piece of

174
00:23:49,370 --> 00:24:03,668
software and hardware it's different
interfaces its cold storages so so let's

175
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:12,230
try to guess how we can use
vulnerabilities in 4G modems to get

176
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:19,049
texts to host which use with more than

177
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:52,260
internet connection at a control piece
was wirelessly Hackett and was updated

178
00:24:52,260 --> 00:25:00,800
it starts to works other network device
that and this is ok because this is a

179
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:15,260
modern I'm sorry call me but after
timeout these devices become a keyboard

180
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:28,550
and those who flee keyboard can type no
hands but somebody typing with our model

181
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:35,250
as a real hard currencies so long which
calculator after its get bias its

182
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,280
application to understand hardware
specification of the laptop and reboot

183
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:59,160
the computer during reboot then became a
cd-rom drive why

184
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:07,430
the movies computer from the cd-rom and
urine brute either style would keep on

185
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,530
the system and can by-pass any security
features on your device

186
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:28,780
become a question for you one guess how
to bypass security bias using these

187
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:38,300
attacks because now many laptops devices
have a security feature some buyers you

188
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:48,500
get special price from Scott estranged
wife team let's imagine with we have a

189
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:56,840
passport on the bias so from the bias
from the USB view not work but how to

190
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:07,620
bypass this protection and against among
the school

191
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:25,219
ok bias is it interacts with different
devices to interact with devices we need

192
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:39,900
their computers piece of software to
interact with devices and driver have

193
00:27:39,900 --> 00:28:01,380
excellent prices yours so drivers have
box so biased have drivers for carved

194
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:09,690
these cool keyboard from my sis and
nobody care about vulnerabilities in

195
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:17,580
driver older models why because how to
exploit remotely vulnerability in mice

196
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,500
Driver Easy

197
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:27,429
bad use be so with you jumped up surveys
printer driver smiles drivers file

198
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,690
system drivers etc etc

199
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:37,130
trend is good speed and seventy brothers
had a good research on these but we're

200
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,860
thinking about only workout local
exportation of such vulnerabilities but

201
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:48,870
such vulnerabilities can be exploited
remotely and sometimes it can be

202
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:56,879
exported to the internet it's against
simple help you to find the water of 4G

203
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,730
modems witchcraft web interface

204
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:10,460
Intermap so how it's related to thank
you

205
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:21,340
house situated to SCADA security
obviously many industrial system use

206
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:30,240
special devices wireless modem smiled as
I wrote us to connect to central point

207
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,790
management Boynton cetera and obviously
this vulnerability scan be up late to

208
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:44,149
such system but we thought our next talk
maybe

209
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:56,020
max conference well a few steps back do
the smart grids to winter being sent in

210
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:10,120
jeans and anybody already see the movie
like this year hollywood movie well if

211
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:20,409
somebody didn't see it please close your
ears disabled you translate the device

212
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:30,840
going to give you should spoil about the
movie and at the beginning of the movie

213
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:39,250
their pool the button push push the
button in turn on the laptop and send

214
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,300
some packets too big

215
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:48,470
strange engine machine and as a result
is going into big physical disaster

216
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:57,310
unfortunately from our experience it's
real scenario everybody knows who that

217
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:04,668
about hollywood fairytales Hollywood but
as I said from our experiences

218
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:14,669
real type of attack because based on the
simple protocols which can increase or

219
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:22,859
decrease pitot tube of 12 machine and
big heavy machine in gene and so on

220
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:37,249
simply one for example UDP packet can
change physical system well connected to

221
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:42,090
the internet radio antennas and so on

222
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:49,529
we find out an article and some journal
called the communication of agent-based

223
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:55,299
model breeds well communication what
does it mean we was really impressed

224
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:07,739
about this article and main idea was to
connect system energy system to some

225
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:18,350
kind of social network and to create
these powerful social network and the

226
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:28,879
media was to get disability for users to
send some kind of social network it's in

227
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:35,840
our days like iCloud cloud network to
send the data about

228
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:44,580
power generation and exchange between
users you can show your neighbor look

229
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:52,908
how many Asian generated I'm save the
oil so i'm good guy why you generated so

230
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:58,940
much so much let's work together to
generate more energy and more but these

231
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,970
have back side with a broad

232
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:13,669
downsize or follow into Syria Gaede
previous century Rio was proud about our

233
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:19,630
big drugs a lot of money but nowadays we
should proud about how much energy

234
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:28,429
reproduce and thought it was a deal to
distribute SCADA system to the cloud

235
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:39,580
well and one of the system who going to
be its other local and so they look

236
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,840
purple get connected

237
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:51,379
a lot of devices to the system and well
simply its web based system based part

238
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:56,100
out and the same as another one

239
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:06,510
systems for vulnerabilities well one of
the beauties give as many as a result is

240
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,480
give

241
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:16,010
possibility to create be connected to
the home smart grid system and these

242
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:26,540
cases remote code execution and just
simply club Porto can connect to all

243
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:40,699
devices patch management sometimes to
find winner ability is easiest part also

244
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:47,089
after these other Whitehead you should
fix it or force somebody to fix it and

245
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:51,830
sometimes it's great troubles for
instance when we first find

246
00:34:51,830 --> 00:35:00,009
vulnerability in so broke we try to
reach the band doesn't return any

247
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:07,900
response so try to coordinate our
activities ICS so it cos basic computer

248
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,460
emergency response team but we get a
response but when it's not interesting

249
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:22,040
because we system not distributed in us-
so we connected we've turned down in

250
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,290
Germany and thanks for them again

251
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:33,960
coordination but in several months we
found General Electric

252
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,370
integrate solar system in smart meters

253
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:48,450
why it's important because smart meters
share information about amount of energy

254
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:55,589
generated by people and not we've agreed
to only i win

255
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:05,549
greet like a cloud but we've powered
retail so so you can fool power greed

256
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:12,239
all the country you can spoof amount of
energy generated or consumed by this

257
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:20,130
installation for sure want to be planted
the rates very small amount of energy

258
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:27,499
few kilowatts only but if you can't
control thousands of plants you can

259
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:41,769
power and you can fool the system and
managed to change power pool in the

260
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:52,118
wrong direction just a demonstration in
short circuit on what it's like looks

261
00:36:52,119 --> 00:37:13,380
like 10 megawatts so it's it's child in
the city sorry so after talk we have a

262
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:26,069
conversation with German electricity
engineer and he told us but European

263
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:32,808
power read only 3 gigawatts of water so
if you can

264
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:44,259
management system for free nigga once
you can make the situation when the

265
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:52,500
lights go out for a long time so we
carry

266
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:03,230
next we will talk about digital
substations digital substations one of

267
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:10,670
the important part of security its
release

268
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:19,250
protection it's kind of protection when
something happened but on the on the

269
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:25,700
left side from this picture and let
Protection Clause any connections any

270
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,569
physical activities between energy
distribution

271
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:36,250
well it's kind of firewall

272
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:44,970
between problem said aunt between real
life side well for relay protection

273
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:55,350
based on icy 61 who formerly protocol
and we did do Brasil about this kind of

274
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:06,580
protocol sent created some two kids to
play with icy protocols and next our

275
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:16,410
activity how to find duties how to
create community to give possibilities

276
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,730
participants to find out their abilities

277
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:30,950
one of the first was is open laboratory
was 85 days it was positive day three

278
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:37,649
and its culture parent laboratory it was
simulation of

279
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,510
railway stations trains and so on

280
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,779
next one was positive

281
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:50,400
days for calls it called critical
infrastructure attack and the main idea

282
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,079
was to find out

283
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,680
label the refugees and the goals was not
only find out who their abilities but

284
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:07,000
also make the disaster and create some
kind of practical tools practical

285
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,430
importance on toys disaster not real
disaster area yes exactly

286
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:21,078
and there was some targets very popular
I see a systems like Schneider Electric

287
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,240
Siemens rocco and so on

288
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:34,669
well after two days for we got a lot of
interesting vulnerabilities and only for

289
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:41,029
two days ago to more than ten 10 days
and one of the winner so was released

290
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:45,490
from message left sorry she found out

291
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,270
binary vulnerabilities a lot of Google
beauty in

292
00:40:49,270 --> 00:41:00,140
Schneider Electric software well and of
course we are beauties we share

293
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:10,700
following by responsible disclosure
policy until the next one and this year

294
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:16,370
was positive for today's digital
substation takeover was quite

295
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:24,339
interesting but it was challenged yes
exactly

296
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:37,740
very interesting challenge participants
and sorry

297
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:45,859
duties

298
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:56,080
it's a real hard way but toys power and
the goal of participants were both to

299
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:02,610
find their way how to make it to a
disaster and you saw

300
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:08,800
greet overload which was created using
vulnerabilities in Siemens si protects

301
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:17,760
system part of our abilities already fix
it by the vendor and we know especially

302
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,800
for Japan's energy it's very important
it's highly important part of your life

303
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:33,310
and Internet we can find out the map of
energy stations and interesting

304
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:41,520
information about energy stations it's
how much energy they produce and also

305
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:49,210
location of this nation following this
information we found out some solar

306
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:55,890
lance and the picture you can see you
can see me and also Kagoshima

307
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:02,950
solar power plants well what about
Kashima is produced created by curse

308
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,830
areas

309
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:09,740
know and we asked me then there is me

310
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:17,609
greeted sunny central big station and
diagram you can see how she planned

311
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:28,220
works and as you know it's me very
interesting when do we find out some

312
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:39,060
vulnerabilities in software and devices
could produce about 70 megawatts of

313
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,770
energy

314
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:46,560
well and as we mentioned before they
produce his simple vulnerabilities like

315
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:57,930
her account and this information public
and we shared with these information

316
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:08,839
we've Japan sound so we hope it was
important responsibilities will be fix

317
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,160
it all already fixed it

318
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:18,319
one additional point its number of the
system connected to the Internet in

319
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,340
Japan re able to find

320
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:32,250
600 of different Scott appeal seas parte
use and most of them use open protocols

321
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:38,570
like industrial protocols I mean like
most bars like S seven and with very

322
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:46,270
good why because such political does not
have any security features at all but

323
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:52,390
this information sharing sorts and I
think will help to secure such system

324
00:44:52,390 --> 00:45:00,170
but anyway now it's Luke like with

325
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:09,140
when you're working before industrial
security you need to have a meeting

326
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:18,170
myself mindset I have one more questions
for you which picture is bad

327
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:32,339
number one or number two number one we
have no signal on number two we have

328
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:48,279
green signal which raise your hand only
to get this season can get a price

329
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:55,450
yeah I have won the prize ok one more to
please everybody

330
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:08,210
one ok you're wrong but then you are you
surprised the bet is to green-light why

331
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:15,559
I will show later one more example of
you have a super heavy trade it strange

332
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:26,500
the beach used several engines and radio
channel to coordinate activity and many

333
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:33,450
people believe if you increase the radio
channel it's safe but in general you

334
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:41,279
don't need to convert encryption you can
judge Emmett and after the gym engines

335
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:48,920
we work in the manner and you can have a
disaster one more example is when you

336
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:57,470
talk with industrial engineers often can
listen something ok our system is sooo

337
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,569
4:30

338
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:05,859
it's a it's cannot happen in disaster
and frankly speaking what is sooo for

339
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:11,259
its certification for a probability of
failure

340
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:18,720
our on demand and leases where a small
number so we system must be safe but if

341
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,950
you can get a remote access to the
system and I'm peat group access to this

342
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,100
platform in several minutes you can
makes everything you can happen here

343
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:40,080
where you can play each execution away
and no suit anymore but people still

344
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:47,110
believe but computers it's a small
airways no its computers is managed by

345
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:56,280
software so now we know what the green
light is bad why because according

346
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:03,680
railway rooms green light to pass the
station on the maximum speed but we have

347
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:13,830
a yellow road salt is walking on the
side way and on the side way because we

348
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:20,319
have a speech and if trained you go on
the maximum speed on the Gulf its can

349
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:30,770
get out of the rain right so you need to
understand not only technical abilities

350
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:36,380
but also our abilities of technological
process to understand what you need to

351
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:43,750
protect one of us create them several
years ago

352
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:51,690
movies so network compared against
approach in different networks so we use

353
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:57,440
technology that moment we used to see p
but would receive moment the coalition

354
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,700
operation Technology Co on their guns so
when different operation to colleges

355
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:10,279
like scarred up my bike carrier payments
internet all the heat clout to use it

356
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:17,880
for different system like smart grid
like public transport like smart CT and

357
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,770
vulnerability in any of these can
correct

358
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:32,500
disaster more it's kids can create
change change affect disaster so for

359
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,710
years we speak on different country
conference for different topics about

360
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:45,370
ATM security about communication
security about trains similar abilities

361
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:53,130
the goal is to demonstrate rivers
Pediatr rivers pyramid it's a concept

362
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:00,560
when when they're ready matisse all the
irrigated device can create big disaster

363
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:08,580
because people do feel such devices
tailgate it but in practice know what

364
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:22,250
you think and ATM and we saw him because
it gives money to his guy without any

365
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:51,790
interruption man gives all it takes the
money and you give additional money

366
00:50:51,790 --> 00:51:01,480
real forensic tape from carbon arc
robbery when cybercriminals able to talk

367
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,980
about one billions of you using
different when their ability to

368
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,960
implement software how this works

369
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:18,580
YBC teams with guys ok let's go to use
Google again so he showed up and let's

370
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:26,470
try to find ATM and internet it's
amazing internet ATM yes but we can find

371
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:36,939
a challenge its NCR terminal Iranian on
the top of those two files and anybody

372
00:51:36,940 --> 00:52:06,850
here hella trouble to find
vulnerabilities in Windows 2000

373
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:22,549
and again thank you so much and don't
forget 12 yep questions please if you

374
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:36,920
have a time consuming I just

375
00:52:36,920 --> 00:53:03,130
of money from ATM I think it's was so
much
