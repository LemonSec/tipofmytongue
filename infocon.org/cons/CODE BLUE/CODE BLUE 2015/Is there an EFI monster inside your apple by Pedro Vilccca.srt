1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:17,570
welcome to the last presentation very
tired

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:26,900
flights to present a very interesting
topics if I so let's start it's my

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,230
second comment I was here last year we
shall see you know me I'm a very famous

4
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:42,050
for Smith famous mac OS how can I like a
lot of stuff like I'm an economist's I

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,538
like politics if you follow me on
Twitter you'll see many times

6
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:52,329
ranting about politics and these days I
work for that company Sentinel one its

7
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,600
next-generation TV company i dissolve
the with another colleague the first

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,760
version of the Mac products these days
I'm just doing random research and

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,710
helping the developing team because we
have a development team and they have

10
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,329
the problem to develop the product and I
just saves world can or help them

11
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:17,079
develop new techniques just a quick note
for the translators think you're welcome

12
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,880
title for translating the slights to
Japanese and life translators will ever

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,350
have to work with me because I talk too
much

14
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,140
so thank you very much what is this
presentation about I want to introduce

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,509
you to if I don't know how many are
still know if I it's not a topic that

16
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,040
many people do research on or no box and
the main core of this is to how to teach

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,970
you to reinforce if I when minorities
many people think it's very difficult to

18
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:55,289
reverse this because it's very low level
what I want to show you it's not not

19
00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:00,399
that difficult as long you can reverse
engineer Intel wineries you can reverse

20
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,530
if I and then to terminate want to throw
you out to search for if I would get

21
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,319
some techniques there aren't many if I
would create one of the reasons I will

22
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,810
conclude least know where no one or very
few people are looking for them and if

23
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,239
you are not looking will not find
anything

24
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,810
assumptions of this presentation my
research machine was that computer a

25
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,350
MacBook Pro retainer 10.1 these means
it's a try with different machines will

26
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,769
see some small differences but
everything is more or less the same as

27
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,450
long you find out what those differences
are you will have no problem with that

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:48,000
only care about 64 bit operating systems
from michael kors

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,140
the singing is 32 bits is dead in terms
of Apple so I don't care about that and

30
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,910
also the Sandy Bridge Rd worst chipset
this means that for example Core 2 Duo

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,459
machines I'm not interested I will show
you those machines are basically

32
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:14,860
breakable they are not secure so if you
use those machines just buy a new one so

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:22,130
why why why I'm doing this presentation
why I wrote 173 slights about these why

34
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,640
why it's important why I want to show
you to convince you this is an important

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:36,100
stop its I is a replacement wires if you
are working with computers for the past

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,720
30 years twenty years in some point in
time

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,940
violence these days it's if I or you SIU
SIU is a new branch version of if I

38
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:58,049
because Intel develop the first version
until 11 points 12th Airport for the

39
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,769
version on one point I'm buying by
sorting it means most of the stuff is

40
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,900
there if you read the documentation from
intel on that site you can understand

41
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,720
everything from Apple and then Apple has
some very specific stuff that I will

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,290
show you some things some of those
things and others are not very important

43
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,430
or something you can reverse is so you
would find is the new version is the one

44
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,000
that you find on normal pieces you don't
find that one on on Mike's if you can

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,020
talk if I can understand if I can
understand USI there's new features

46
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,960
mostly but it's you can interchange
between the two persons that's that is

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
the websites

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,449
and the first one you have all the
termination original documentation so if

49
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,020
you win the first documentation you can
understand USIM then there's something

50
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,750
specific you can you can move between
between the two versions why is that if

51
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,020
I very important it's the first
component or one of the first components

52
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,560
when you start your computer

53
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,229
the first instruction that your CPU will
execute is in a fixed position in the

54
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,409
price so it starts your machine if you
control the buyers will start

55
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,169
controlling most of the machine because
everything comes up after the buyers has

56
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:20,859
access to all that way because it it
will need to talk to the hardware to the

57
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,550
memory to to start the machine it is
very much you'll see that everything is

58
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,980
so it's very it's very easy to reach

59
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,380
a model or even for example you can have
an HTTP Server there's a new standards

60
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,740
that wants to boot

61
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,610
the image of the machine from HTTP HTTP
and HTTPS that's another discussion it's

62
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,789
very easy to develop

63
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:55,719
see you have to ask the case and idk to
they are the same with some differences

64
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,930
doesn't matter for for now but it's very
easy to develop just need to know see

65
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,770
some very specifics about the
development and because it's more than

66
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:12,380
we can develop a lot of models that will
work in our machines that he saw your

67
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,509
USI before with the buyers this wasn't
true most of mister for developing a

68
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:22,699
similar most was specific to machines so
it was the development was a lot more

69
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,710
complicated than if I interesting things

70
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:37,729
attacks only five examples of what we
can do why if I is important and that's

71
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:46,620
never touches your harddisk this is very
interesting because I just ran six you

72
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,979
just need to have an image of your hard
disk if someone changes in your disk you

73
00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:02,070
can detect if there is something that
modify the usual kids so that is you put

74
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,849
a rootkit later in the flesh ship wonder
where they if I went to the machine

75
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:11,190
starts you put something the colonel

76
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,020
the process you can attack your browser
for example and you never put

77
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,099
information on on the artist this is
really interesting in terms of

78
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,660
protection because nothing will go to
the hardest if you want to see more

79
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,700
details about this you can check the
snares presentation shows the technique

80
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,150
to patch the kernel to attack the
kernels from is fine and then after that

81
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:41,229
you can do whatever you want to guest
operating system can be very hard to

82
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,660
detect as I told you you are starting at
very

83
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,030
very early in the machine so you control
hardware and then you have an operating

84
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,229
system on top of the hard work so you
can control the hardware and you try to

85
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,210
detect something from software is very
difficult to to do my position is that

86
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,330
it's impossible to do unless you have an
assistant from hardware very safe

87
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,280
channel that allows you to communicate
if you want to see a discussion about

88
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,489
this I was discussing this week or last
week on Twitter with few more guys about

89
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,070
this because there was a volatility
developer saying he could detect this

90
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,130
and we were trying to prove that if you
are from software it will be very

91
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:34,659
difficult to detect something at
hardware most things you can persist

92
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,839
across system operating system restore
this will be for example a very

93
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:47,810
interesting feature for apt this will be
really pity because if the user you ever

94
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,829
Windows installation

95
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:56,330
you have some lower as you saw on
today's presentation attendees in fact

96
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,510
the machine or told you that it could be
very difficult for example this will

97
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,160
make a very big obstacle to clean the
machine because you reinstall the

98
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,449
machine and later on if i restore itself
again so you will never clean the

99
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,640
machine and I see the flash chip one
example of the rootkit from this is a

100
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,960
continued as you know they were two
months ago or something and they this

101
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,860
kind of food kids they wanted to if the
victim or the target was infected with

102
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,960
this it could reinstall windows as many
times as you wanted that you will always

103
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,960
be under control of the word came from
acting more interesting stuff out to

104
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,110
take full disk encryption even greater
machine should be in following on

105
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,100
Twitter Stefan Esser says he was
attacked this week someone broke into

106
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,910
his hotel and try to copy the artist if
you have your hard disk encrypted that

107
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:05,189
will do not not do anything because the
person what's going to install firmware

108
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,540
would keep them if I would kids and get
the password

109
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,199
many attacks an attack scenarios are
possible this on this you can have a

110
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,570
rootkit that always gets password or you
can ever for example a rootkit that you

111
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,750
install once you get the password and
you quickly send you find a way to send

112
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,540
the password to remote server or
something and then you remove the route

113
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,760
kids the next step you go to the hotel
you copy the Hardys hopefully the

114
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,860
password is the same and defend the
crates everything so this is very

115
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,700
interesting

116
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,990
ducks in a row for people that's rival

117
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,080
the rule is never travel with important
information or travel with the least

118
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,170
important information you can do

119
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,800
attacking operating system I'm not sure
if you know tells tales is an operating

120
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,510
system that starts from a city-run the
purposes nothing goes to die in this apt

121
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,439
is not possible because every time you
start the computer it's clean car which

122
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,209
are the guys that do a lot of research
on on if i from where they have shown an

123
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:17,599
attack from if I which is from tales he
was showing you have a secure operating

124
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,130
system you are writing private emails
for example we were a journalist or

125
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,830
whistleblower and trying to disclose
information and they showed they can get

126
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:34,300
the keys to the PGP keys they can get
you the best word for the PC keys so the

127
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,300
operating system fails is not secure in
this area once again we are attacking

128
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,260
from hardware to software the software
cannot guarantee that it's safe even if

129
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,500
it's booting from a serious run or
something that is will only some of

130
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,170
their attacks you can attack the
bootloader this is something that you

131
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,750
saw in Windows with the TV

132
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,820
branch material tire are three and four
for example or very old virus is seen in

133
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,720
the bias times you will detect the BIOS
and and put something there is very

134
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,830
simple this one you can put as a member
of course there's the very interesting

135
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:19,250
post from that Russian researcher crash
but installing as a member colors as a

136
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,160
privilege level on your CPU very
interesting if you can run run cold

137
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,270
there you can control the whole machine
so this is very interesting 22 puts

138
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:36,920
route kids have convinced you with this
is that if you control the fight your

139
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,260
computer is under the control of the
tiger you cannot do anything from sister

140
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,540
you have to search for you have to get
into the integrity at hardware level

141
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,800
this is why he saw it is very important
for the security of you fight is

142
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,870
important

143
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:08,610
let me go briefly above ground 0 this
story so two months ago or three months

144
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:15,779
ago or even my I woke up probably not in
a very good mood and decided to release

145
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:22,580
the singer is what it was accidental 0
day because I didn't knew it was here

146
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,279
that I assume that people knew about the
book because there there was the tender

147
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,260
straight presentation that blanket and I
assume ok they disclosed they know the

148
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,569
but there is no problem

149
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,260
disclosing and it made the whole
confusion my van lines on a bunch of

150
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,020
newspapers and

151
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,660
websites which is basically about that
allows you to control the firmware of

152
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,520
the max you can read on that on that
website on my on my blog the whole

153
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,569
description about this I will just go
very fast on a hundred what happens is

154
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,340
the operating system you have an
operating system you have done if I they

155
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:11,260
are at different levels and if you can
write from the operating system to the

156
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,080
flash your computer is basically as a
very severe security problems and this

157
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,220
is what happened with with with with
this budget and with Apple there was a

158
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,930
way to write to the firmware from the
software advantage of these is that what

159
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:34,310
example you have suffered by remote code
execution both on the browser you can

160
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,869
start their day of the user goes to
websites they exploit is executed and

161
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,870
then you continue to go down to install
rootkits or is just come to two routes

162
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,660
and then you might have to flash

163
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,140
you why you write to deflation meaning
he was stolen if I would get stolen if I

164
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,480
would get to control the machine as long
as you want because probably no one will

165
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,510
search through to get to their knees but
was very similar to time the strike if

166
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,329
you follow

167
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:13,118
Mac security issues and the strike was
presented in 2014 at CCC which was

168
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:19,290
basically an attack with bandwidth
Thunderbolt adapter so this is one of

169
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,660
the reasons why when someone offers to
you to you can use mine ever just

170
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,610
because this is very interesting for
installing rootkits the difference is

171
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,989
that would kids that under strike you
need to plug in this so this is physical

172
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:40,559
attack and my work was remote attack or
it could be triggered as a remote attack

173
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,600
which is a way more powerful because i
dont have physical access to your

174
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,980
computer

175
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:54,360
the funny thing is that in 2000 and 2012
was writing these are his presentation

176
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,589
he was writing that equal rights from
the operating system to the flash and

177
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,839
this is the reason why the core 2 duo
machines or everything ordered and Sandy

178
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,239
Bridge is vulnerable because those
machines don't have any / protections

179
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:14,509
Intel develop those protections under
understanding bridge steps should set so

180
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:18,879
those machines if you have access if you
still use one of those machines remote

181
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:26,699
attacker can put it on your machine is
so don't use those machines the book was

182
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,829
very simple to trigger it just need to
put your computer to sleep or force it

183
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:36,388
to sleep when you walk up the computer
it will be vulnerable state this was one

184
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:43,640
of the reasons why the boy was very
sunny and created a bit of a mess

185
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,689
in the media and with Apple because it
was very simple you don't need

186
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,180
complicated exploit you just need to put
your machine to sleep I found this when

187
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,510
I was researching I started with a fight
because I had a computer that was what I

188
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,060
couldn't i couldn't remember the
password and I found this blog

189
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:09,300
while doing some research there as I
told the court to do machines are

190
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,490
vulnerable

191
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,990
machines that are vulnerable ordering
laxative performer will produce one

192
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,069
Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge this was
funny and this was one of the reasons

193
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,520
why I wish the book because the newer
versions were informed about what's

194
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,080
happened is that Apple patched the bug
why what they didn't know the book was

195
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,020
there they just patched by my luck
probably because until gives reference

196
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,870
codes to the to the developers and the
bug was fixed during and Apple part in

197
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:48,610
the book part of the fix it and that's
it you have a plate available for all

198
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:55,639
these epithets that works weeks later so
it probably is you install some new

199
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,640
version of Mac OS for the latest updates
your computers are not vulnerable like

200
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,780
me anymore if you didn't install should
install because the world is shown it is

201
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,870
very easy to exploit if you are
interested in details about reversing

202
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,860
then I wrote a second post with a lot of
reversing details which is basically a

203
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,689
compliment to this presentation lot more
details a lot more technical

204
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,460
presentation isn't already technical go
there if you are interested in this I

205
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,420
explain you are out to understand the
book how to create your own six so it's

206
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,440
a very very interesting post in terms of
that I also put the other relevant

207
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,490
documentation or the basic documentation
that you need because if I standards are

208
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,020
like thousands of pieces manuals like
with thousands of pages so it's a lot of

209
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,420
stuff to read it away those are you she
skipped through came through on on those

210
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:57,020
on those manuals that I've there you'll
know the basics of if there were more

211
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,680
bodies that were already fights that are
finally already patch they were the same

212
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,860
type of books that allow you to rights
to the flash from the operating system

213
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,060
this was presented by the legwork our
guys the guys that do a lot of research

214
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,960
on this

215
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,450
these bugs are finally fixed Apple
released its new parts last week because

216
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,730
there were more bugs presenting in terms
of strike two blankets they were still

217
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,450
Apple isn't still haven't met yet those
birds but finally last week they release

218
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,720
this so this this life is not a plated
cars guys were saying this one which was

219
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,540
mine and theirs was budget and there was
a bunch of books that were attached but

220
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,649
Apple's Final finally purchased those
bugs they're the very interesting site

221
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,780
from their presentation where they
complain that sample wasn't fast enough

222
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,800
66 and the books I finally talked to
Apple about my work they leave a lot of

223
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,909
hard work sixteen the box this thing is
that you can

224
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,650
discuss that I made a very responsible
or not

225
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,710
thing in this causing the zero day the
thing is that they fix the bug really

226
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,510
size and my position is that Apple
doesn't like when they have bad

227
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:21,140
publicity and they react faster when
something is guess time when they get

228
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,040
bad publicity so this is the same side
from last year I know a lot of people

229
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,850
but I still tell them a lot of times
that they don't know what they are doing

230
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,679
most of the time hopefully they will
improve their quality that secured

231
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:48,130
quality so I was this was really to
convince you until now the importance of

232
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,190
you fight now let's go into a fight what
do you know

233
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:57,380
need to know the basics so if you want
to go into a fight to spend 1-2 months

234
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,540
is to learn the basics or I'm giving you
the most important thing is that I think

235
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,690
so if you want you can go home get the
slides the conference publishes them

236
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,490
today and start learning if I start
working with it and don't need to know

237
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,320
all the basics or the the small problems
that I had to go through the first thing

238
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,179
is where is the the trip we we have
access to the chip to chip usually

239
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,010
something like this you can find in your
computer you have to search we are to

240
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:33,720
open and search for the truth it's
usually a CMOS serial serial flash these

241
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,440
are the two most popular chips in the in
the Sandy Bridge and ivory ivory reach

242
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,160
models it's the chip doesn't matter you
can find you relive the specs on the

243
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,980
manufacturer websites so it's not a big
problem

244
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,520
interesting detail they are all SPI SPI
is a serial protocol to talk to the

245
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,820
chips if you are an awkward person you
probably know this protocol it's very

246
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,090
easy it's

247
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:05,639
8 pins to that unit connector usually
some the white protection and there is

248
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,220
that it's very easy to talk and in terms
of programming the code that you need to

249
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,820
talk it's not very difficult so it's a
very interesting protocol to read the

250
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,250
contents of the ship that support most
of the ship's eight megabytes in size

251
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,059
for these machines for all the other
machines the court to do you have two

252
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,270
megabytes and something else you can
also find some that are sixteen

253
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:35,149
megabytes in size on on your machine
depends on the model also another cheap

254
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:39,789
one and the new machines the windblown
version this is probably apple just

255
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:44,210
doing sort saying they got a better
price from these guys and got the ships

256
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,140
from them

257
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,000
the list from all the ship that you will
find on max might be updated with new

258
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:02,210
versions but nothing very important an
important detail 44 US ships are eight

259
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:12,789
piece which is the format that picture
but are starting to use this assembly or

260
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:18,679
PGA PGA is with a small penis that their
side is make these drinks problem

261
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,529
because with the cycle just a test clips
rope clip which you plug into the trip

262
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:31,929
and you are connected to the trip with
SMD its older so you cannot say usually

263
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:38,909
connects approach and PGA is even worse
because they are under side they are not

264
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:44,350
so they could be there are under under
the small bowls and they sit there the

265
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,459
problem is if we want to access those
ships we need to the soldiers those

266
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,610
ships so this is just a potentially
destructive process on

267
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:01,490
accessing the ship for example if you
want to do like I do if you want to dump

268
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,720
before you travel with you want to learn
if you have one of these versions it's

269
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,500
very complicated to do that because I I
can destroy the computer and these are

270
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,580
some of the models that I think using
are using the SMD BGA because I cannot I

271
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,659
don't have these computers but I was
seeing pictures and I i cannot find the

272
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,480
site on those if you want to do
experiments you can buy this from

273
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,309
Aliexpress you probably have the same
better access to electronics in Japan

274
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:38,309
then I have important go but they are
very easy to buy from the shipping us so

275
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:42,620
if you want to do experiments testing
your calls instead of going on on the

276
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:53,340
ship on the machine chip you can buy
them and that's it so I actually what is

277
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,540
the trip where it is how it is always
looks now where it is inside the machine

278
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:08,580
because you have to know where where it
is like my retainer 15 issues as the

279
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,189
easiest taxes you just disassemble it
and the chip is there other mcintosh's

280
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,650
or other Macs are very difficult indeed
to disassemble the whole machine because

281
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,419
usually they are undersized the machine
but I ever this machine which is a Mac

282
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:29,620
Pro 8.1 8.1 an older machine and with
some practice are already can

283
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:36,409
disassemble the machine in five minutes
so for example of an hour is enough time

284
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,720
to go to your room to your hotel room
open a machine disassembled everything

285
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,900
is still a rootkit directly assemble
again and literacy so it depends a lot

286
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,350
on the machine let me show you some
pictures so these a retainer to return a

287
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,830
model that I talk about it just removed

288
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,570
underside cover and the waves year the
ship this is the power where the battery

289
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:07,389
is connected to the ship is there just
plug in and crazy to axis

290
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,250
MacBook Air doesn't matter to model the
chip is always on underside the

291
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,059
motherboard so you need to disassemble
the whole machine extract the

292
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:23,658
motherboard and then finally access to
the chip mcnealy the same the Mac Mini

293
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:27,880
is very compact so you need to
disassemble everything again and axis

294
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,380
the chip the Mac Pro

295
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,549
the one that is run by the trash can is
also very complicated issue to this

296
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:40,860
assemble the whole machine to finally
access this tape if you do that

297
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,418
be careful with these connectors they
are very you need to put some friends on

298
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,350
on them to connect max I know this
because I bought one of these computers

299
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,090
or the company sent me one of this and
the first thing I did was open and then

300
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,860
plus like I was curious to say to see if
someone will be installed on my machine

301
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,879
I don't think so and then when I connect
these things the computer goes right and

302
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,370
i was thinkin ok I just destroy the
$5,000 computer I wanted to to access

303
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:18,739
the chip the reason was that this cable
wasn't well thought last one of my

304
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,370
mother ports and you can see what you
can see here is that this is the ships

305
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,500
there is no ships and this thing is that
nigga bites put the ships put the cooler

306
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,299
this is a ship set cooler cooler on top
of the chips so what i mean to do I need

307
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,760
to ban the paintings of the cooler to
access the chips the case here it's not

308
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,129
always easy to access the chips so this
presents a problem for example that

309
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,279
accompany you cannot be assembling
people's computers all the time to

310
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,799
access the church next point we know
where is the trip what we need to know

311
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,590
now or what we want to do is to extract
the contents of the trip

312
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:09,100
there are two ways hardware which is
connecting the test clips to the to the

313
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:15,000
gypsies is why I was showing you where
the trip was because this is the only

314
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,909
way the only reliable way to find if
there's a will there's a way it's

315
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,360
critical mass of the chip is
disconnected the trip has no power

316
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,000
you are supporting the one supplying
power so you are reading I asking too

317
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,049
cheap give me your contents and the
chief we'll give you contents I'm not

318
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:41,039
sure I'm not the only way to to make
these not work would be to install a

319
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,360
wood keeping signs it chip inside the
serial protocol and somehow the cheap

320
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,969
worldwide to you I doubt this is
possible at least on this type of ships

321
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:56,120
so this is at least the best message we
can use forces you can use some softer

322
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:03,539
talk to the cheap software is able to
talk to talk to the trip but obviously

323
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,510
that is not very trustable because if
the machine as a good case it can modify

324
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:15,429
or softer and they'll tell you know
there's no here you are not looking at

325
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:20,299
anything nothing here everything is ok
so this cannot work this is good for

326
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:27,190
experiments but it's not need to change
its I would kids what you need them in

327
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,020
our work something that talks sp

328
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,590
the protocol you have a list of

329
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:41,928
programmers diets that are able to that
you can get an FTDI chip

330
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:47,580
the truth streets who age that does this
guy is this version from crime alerts

331
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,158
and hotter of thunder strike the reason
is that it works if it does the job it

332
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,440
is it is it two years does the job I
don't care anymore about the problem is

333
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:09,100
his lecture is based on the TV 2.0 and
3.0 two versions both work well as it is

334
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,059
very simple

335
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:15,899
this is the team's report and this is
the cheap meals using a test clip to

336
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,029
connect to the chip this is the easiest
way because you don't need to connect

337
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:26,149
every every problem it is very cheap to
build its cost you like $30 if you buy a

338
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:32,610
Chinese clone trooper doesn't matter
much it's very simple so you can be ok

339
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:39,668
with a plan not to be its biggest
advantage is that it dumps the whole

340
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:45,090
contents in 8 megabits I try to do some
research on if I like two or three years

341
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,918
ago and only seeing ahead was

342
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,470
Pirates the problem is that the bus
pirate thanks four hours to them

343
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,100
night megabyte 64 megabit or eight
megabytes / is not feasible if you are

344
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,480
doing research within four hours for
something to finish it's not it's not

345
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,270
good to do the research the
israeli-lebanese version is fast enough

346
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,789
for forties purpose

347
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:18,379
let me just skip this stuff this is for
your reference eases the pain out of MSP

348
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,260
a ship usually need to check with that
achieve their success but most

349
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,230
manufacturers follow this disrespect
these pains so it shouldn't be a problem

350
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,590
if not you can adapt to to the chip is
not very complicated this is the layout

351
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,428
on under tents in a seng nothing very
complicated solar their soul into the

352
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:45,919
chip and whoever you're with SPI flash
are you can you can use it for 4 with

353
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:53,429
just a small refused to its different
voltages five votes

354
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:59,360
the chip the flagship sorrow of 3.3 so
you need to put photos right blades are

355
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,158
difficult to this website it contains
the part number which is that one and

356
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,270
CPW and where to solve it so it's five
minutes or less

357
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:20,860
solar days and and its ok you might have
some problems with the chip not working

358
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:26,449
not talking one visit one very basic
street is you just can't connect the

359
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,159
right product and results beans to the
voters p.m. I don't know why this works

360
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,640
it works so for me it's not a problem
anymore

361
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,710
lasting you see some diagrams everyone
calls the pins different names I just

362
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:46,120
like these for you if you see different
diagrams they'll use different names so

363
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,290
you have

364
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:56,879
small map to the plane's the flesh if
you think she is simply relax mother

365
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,090
command and USB chip to read the
contents of the trip was meeting with

366
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,959
the contents of the 26 minutes seven
minutes later you have the content in

367
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,080
this case it's eight megabytes from and
you can see he's here this is something

368
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,770
that I did before traveling to career I
don't mind my room so I have something

369
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:25,440
to verify if someone attacked me which
would not be very smart results right

370
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,940
you connect to the program is say I want
to write the whole all cheap and then

371
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,160
you send a message to the to the chip
and check the TV will do the work for

372
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:48,700
you and writes the contents some
problems not very important so I will go

373
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,060
just on the first one of the first
technique to save time the other ones

374
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:58,480
you also ten years these two but nothing
very important something that you can

375
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,170
really do yourselves you need Flash run
this utility is very non agility

376
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,600
open-source utility that is able to talk
to many different types of ships not

377
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,060
justify ships or / ships were

378
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:21,290
SPI is 10 years this and this is colonel
extension that allows you to the machine

379
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,219
to talk directly to the hardware is
kinda like session is not good signed

380
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,409
meaning that in Serie will not be able
to load on the latest Mac OS versions

381
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:38,279
but at least this so what's it worth it
still works with all versions except the

382
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,340
latest one Delta pattern because if you
were here last year for my presentation

383
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:53,460
I use this to load with kids into into
the system

384
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,110
an example out two outs to dump with
flash ROM you just load the kernel

385
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:05,730
extension and then use flash from and
till force from the contents you can see

386
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,070
here

387
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:13,630
identifying the chip in this case it's
one of the ships that I told you it's

388
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:20,910
very common tell you some information
about the Chipman then start sweetie and

389
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,970
then few minutes usually it's very fast
so this was probably like 10 minutes or

390
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:32,689
something you have the same contents of
the tape then you can use this to to

391
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:38,910
analyze this is the part I want to skip
some something different way to do it

392
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,640
but actually it's myself or so

393
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,019
same problems nothing there has it all
the software is good enough to four

394
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:56,640
experiments if you are looking for if
you are doing incident response software

395
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,700
will not save you unless you are what
get to something life acting team acting

396
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,109
team was only interested in persistence
in keeping across results they did

397
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,630
nothing to hide the rootkit so if you
that permission that is infected with

398
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,400
acting thing would get from softer
you'll see the rootkit there if you know

399
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,180
me I say a lot of things from hacking
thing if I was designing these would get

400
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,629
this is this will be the first thing I
would work on just by the road trips

401
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:35,049
make make yourself invisible 22 incident
response like stopping what are the

402
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:40,390
contents you know where the strip tease
you finally got its contents now what's

403
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:45,328
in there what what we need to look at
what are you looking at

404
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:50,849
example of the content you always see
this this is the descriptor region which

405
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:55,309
says content is here there and they're
in there and they're this type of

406
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:01,599
content this is the Intel Management
Engine mountains there was a

407
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:08,009
presentation at the first cold blue by
Igor which is very big black boxes very

408
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:11,070
interesting like books for kids

409
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,520
Igor is the only person in public doing
research on this I will talk about

410
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,650
bodies in a bit and then you have the
buyers region which contains all the

411
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:26,540
contents that we want to do work to work
for finding good scripts or reverse

412
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:35,590
engineering another example miles from
your machine you give each region which

413
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,610
is basically contents of on boards
network cards Intel understand their

414
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,900
standards says you can use the flash to
put some data there so they are using

415
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,140
the flash for other stuff I once again

416
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,560
Management Engine region and then you
have another region here and never

417
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,190
explored the contents of these it's
irrelevant doesn't have it's very small

418
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:04,050
and it doesn't have anything interesting
at least from the manuals

419
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,240
it serves to troll you that you can see
different contents in the biased but

420
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,330
this is something that you always hear
the bias and the descriptor they are

421
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:21,620
there for sure that shows you the the
contents of suppliers you can see the

422
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:27,060
descriptor here and this is information
about the script and then this is the

423
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,240
contents of the buyers files

424
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,109
different different template that
contains a different region the platform

425
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,410
region the PCR reagents are examples

426
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:46,200
what is the descriptor as I told you it
contains says contents are these buyers

427
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,250
region you can find that address X

428
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,700
Jacob it can be at address that and so
on

429
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,439
intense access permissions meaning you
don't want for example the network card

430
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,880
to access the bias because that will be
an obvious way to make a rootkit to

431
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,490
attack the network card and then from
the network cards you attack the the

432
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:15,160
flash and what gets so it guarantees
that its region cannot talk to each

433
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,450
other if you don't want

434
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,689
Intel Management Engine region if you
remember your presentation

435
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:31,180
told you that Intel Management Engine
it's basically a CPU inside your CPU its

436
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,520
runs they're the most surprising thing
if its runs Java so your Intel CPU as

437
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:45,259
Java running inside in parallel that's
not very very secure Java source of

438
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,970
problems it can be active when your
machine is powered off if as long there

439
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:57,129
is a battery inside the machine or power
source connected to it that that ship

440
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:04,310
can do something for example it does it
can connect to the network does that

441
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:11,170
ship as an independent MAC address just
444 administration have a big company or

442
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,560
machines are half and you want to for
example to good name for launching a

443
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,070
place or something it's very interesting
feature but the problem is that it can

444
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,420
be a very powerful feature four
attackers if they find Wilma realities

445
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,030
there there's no access from bias and
operating system unless you find a

446
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,609
vulnerability you can't talk to that you
don't know what these days you cannot

447
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:38,180
find what is running with what is
happening there as I told you you got me

448
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,149
through presentations in different years
11 of those presentations was that this

449
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:50,130
is an area that requires more research
people are talking about this again from

450
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,980
the blue pill fame release the paper
this week about she says

451
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,119
x86 is insecure forever because you have
Intel Management Engine you have another

452
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,829
stuff that is insecure or let we don't
know what is running Intel management

453
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:12,780
engine is definitely something that we
need more research on these are the

454
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,420
links for our presentations you can read
them

455
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:25,670
revisit again those presentations

456
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,940
by his reason the contents of the buyers
region this is the one that we are

457
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,160
working on this presentation contains by
notice if I binaries for different

458
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,259
places I will show you what are these
phases and Iran non-volatile run for

459
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,960
example your Mac's

460
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:53,630
we wifi password on this region so if I
find a way to the memory I can extract

461
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,970
your wifi password and then crack it
this is wonderful reasons why unlike you

462
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:04,430
for mites you restore your Mac when
after you install it knows your network

463
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:11,589
because the information is saved their
microcode you're not always see this in

464
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,970
every models it depends on the models I
guess if Intel releases a new version

465
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,578
then when there's an update

466
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:23,430
microcode is there if the the CPU
version doesn't have microcode it's not

467
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,440
there

468
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,200
think everything happens in a far more
potent former Fulham is a container for

469
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:38,098
different day 2444 today Tony fine for
example the NVRAM is the firmware volume

470
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:45,210
different minority will be indifferent
form where volumes is a picture of my

471
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:50,980
buyers with different different content
as you can see each other this is a

472
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:57,670
former volume for example this value is
microcode is one is the non-volatile RAM

473
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,530
and this is where the machine starts
between from what we can see here is

474
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:09,170
that everything is a number and letters
he's calling again if you don't know

475
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,020
this from windows its standard formats
188

476
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:19,009
characters for months basically to
describe something it should be unique

477
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,790
so everything in if I isn't is a gift

478
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:29,540
violence you don't have something saying
platform security that aside everything

479
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,600
is a get this makes things a bit
different

480
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,799
difficult to win because they don't have
names on things so when you are reverse

481
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,280
engineering you don't have anything else
to do then you have to translate that

482
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,600
yourselves the content of most of this
gives you can find on the under if I

483
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,350
specs

484
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:53,470
this is where you download all the
manuals and then use the PDF search

485
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:59,790
version to see you find the give and you
want to know what it means there are

486
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:06,360
many gives the time vendor-specific or
private meaning Apple as some gifts that

487
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,450
doesn't published you don't know the
meaning so we need to reverse engineer

488
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,799
to to understand what they are doing
their privates

489
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,820
some manufacturers polish their
delegates others they kept private and

490
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:25,310
you only reverse engineering you know
its contents so Google and some luck

491
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:30,490
your friends in in this case if you can
google indeed if some hit it will save

492
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:38,279
you reverse engineering work it's not
you have to Lodi the 16th yourselves is

493
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,230
an example of the scripts that snare
created what it does for either what it

494
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,740
does it translates all the gates to
something to English that you can read

495
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,779
and this is one of your tools

496
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:56,140
minor into either executive script
hopefully it knows the gates and it will

497
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,750
translate something between wish your
job will be much easier

498
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:08,780
what happens when you start your
computer

499
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:15,730
the the most famous charting if I almost
every if I presentation uses this one

500
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:20,250
what happens this is the security face
when you start your machine this is the

501
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:26,950
first place it tries to ensure that
everything is ok with a machine so if

502
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,330
everything is ok you can continue in the
process then you have the play phase

503
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:37,130
which is free if i shouldnt this is the
phrase where it will start setting your

504
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:43,100
machine ready for the next phases for
example one of the most important tasks

505
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:49,370
is to set my my earliest memories
difference different phases of the

506
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,990
mission this is one of the faces that
takes care of setting my memory four

507
00:45:53,990 --> 00:46:00,069
days for the exe the phrase that takes
longer time because it loads drivers

508
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:05,820
that talk to the hard work you can put
for example an HTTP Server shear and so

509
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,930
on this is a phrase that many things
happened here and then when this phase

510
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:16,710
is over control to the boots to the
bootloader if it's certainly not see it

511
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,490
can be Grove or other wonder if it's a
Windows machine its passes control to

512
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:27,430
the windows bootloader and so on so this
phase the the operating system or the

513
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:32,910
bootloader is starting to take control
so if I is ending on on on this and this

514
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:38,730
and this race and everything here is
operating system stuff again cos boots

515
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,600
and then cause your machine and saying
start to to track down

516
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,049
and so on as I told you this is one of
the most important set up memory for the

517
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,380
next phase this is one of the important
tasks of the page

518
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:03,480
face another short that's also true good
pass this is the normal one when you

519
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,080
when your computer is off and you start
it follows this one to say the play the

520
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:17,009
XE and then the boot device

521
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:22,300
sleep phase this is where the book that
I disclosed was so example this is a

522
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,990
fight for example when you put your
computer to sleep better there's a bunch

523
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:33,200
of stuff puts some some information in
memory and what happened is that there

524
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,609
is a scripts and the reason for the
script is issued to executive Dax Dax

525
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:45,150
all over again it will take a lot of
time for your machine to resume from

526
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:50,280
sleep there is a standard I didn't hear
that but I think it's like six seconds

527
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,340
that it says your windows when when or
Mac OS when it comes from sleep it must

528
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:01,510
take maximum six seconds to boot so what
they've always the same information that

529
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:08,610
they need in a script and when we come
back from the dead asleep what happens

530
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:13,880
is the SEC raises executed the prefaces
executed but they exceed phase is not

531
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,700
executed anymore because all the
information is in a good script so you

532
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,220
don't need to stoop to execute the
drivers again this is a reason why your

533
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:29,779
computer is fast coming up from from
from sleep like my prices are very

534
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:37,440
quickly you have many drivers inside the
bias out to know the order of execution

535
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,090
there's basically one dispatcher in the
papers and one dispatcher

536
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:49,720
in the exe face and you have
dependencies between them which is a

537
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,100
very small languages back there's this
thank you push you push that everything

538
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:00,250
goes push push and pop from there and
there is a Boolean logic that and so

539
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:06,160
this dispatcher knows what things or
what what the word things need to be

540
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,779
slaughtered last phase out to reverse he
fight you have the contents you know

541
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:19,120
what is that you can access the content
you can find the files I'll do we start

542
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,940
reversing what is the critical
information to start reversing if I

543
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:29,260
these are the two most important tools
you can have on your two set pieces /

544
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,180
Scripps the ones that reversed from give
to find them very important very useful

545
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,049
and is to unify to land UFI extract
allow you to extract the contents where

546
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:45,320
you don't need to create your own
utility those screenshots with the

547
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,620
contents come from this tool is a
graphical too so it's a very nice to

548
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:57,310
this is the most critical tools issued a
warning or to set important thing as

549
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,060
binary they execute so what is the four
months what is the format of the

550
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:07,250
executive the format and is very very
very funny because it speeds 32 and

551
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:12,630
peace 32 + source be 64 you should know
that these are the formats are the

552
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,640
windows for much of the wineries so you
are ever the same for much the same

553
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,450
binary format used on Windows being
executive on his like it could be

554
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:27,490
anything else for much just says this is
our new execute our our the contents

555
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:33,609
they are not for P there's also another
format which is the terse executive oh I

556
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:39,150
will just explained on the next flight
what is this and you can find 16 32 bit

557
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,809
and 64 bit cold inside

558
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:47,489
if I depending on the size if you don't
know your computer still extracts when

559
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:52,880
you start your computer it still runs in
16 bit this comes from legacy the first

560
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,499
computers are the sources tell some of
the first was 16 bits so your computer

561
00:50:57,499 --> 00:51:04,078
stocks in 60 minutes then switches to 32
bit and then the DXCC phases mostly 64

562
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:10,130
bits so you need to reverse all this
kind of cold all of this kind of

563
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:14,180
assembly difference assembly on your
machine

564
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:20,319
it's basically version so nothing very
complicated what happened is that

565
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,630
they've removed some headers that are
not used for anything or do they are not

566
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:30,839
required I guess it was to save space
because the first by the first if I they

567
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:36,308
were two megabits per unit to save space
they can find this format only on these

568
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:42,000
faces the sex and facials is everything
on dat face is P so you only have

569
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,299
trouble here very important detail I is
still unable to disassemble this format

570
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:54,970
so if you load these files into either
you get very confused I will get

571
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:59,618
confused the disassembly is incorrect I
had this problem and I couldn't

572
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:04,650
understand and I finally start reversing
the problem itself and I found out it

573
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:11,109
fails to parse the headers is not six of
the solution is you build your own

574
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:16,160
lawyer I really something here so if you
want to reverse these miners you just

575
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,078
download my coat compiled the plugins
for for either and if been either can

576
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:36,490
finally deal ok with these wineries
leaves here or if you from Windows to

577
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:42,578
link against if you develop you know you
can sleep see if you want to bring down

578
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:47,980
its only see if you want to do a
messagebox a on

579
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,150
Windows you have another system such a
two or something like that

580
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:58,530
Windows binaries in like in a ten years
or so what happens is there are services

581
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:03,600
so instead of having a library that you
link against the web services and

582
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:09,310
whatcha say I want to use that service
and services are nothing more than

583
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:14,509
functions are you can logically
understand them as functions that just

584
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,650
say I want to use them

585
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:20,530
you get the function pointer for the
function and you can execute as a normal

586
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:27,640
function an example of the function in
my face you can see there is a function

587
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,940
to install the PPI I will show you what
is a PPI and other stuff there for

588
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:37,220
example functions for the case memory so
this is the basic functions of the basic

589
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:44,080
set of functions that you have when you
get when you fight someone example let

590
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,730
me go follow these functions you know
the functions are somewhere but you need

591
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:54,960
to know how to access what happened is
that the entry point often if I binary

592
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:02,330
you always have a pointer to a table in
this case this is Lexi Fey's so you have

593
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:08,450
a pointer to the system table underpaid
phase you have a different pointer the

594
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:13,240
table and you can see here are the two
pointers to the to the services are

595
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:20,509
available under under under GXE face so
often go see this type of codes on the

596
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:26,480
exe wineries which is basically making a
local copy of the system table to a

597
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,890
local pointer the book service table and
the runtime services after you have this

598
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:36,060
pointers you know the offsets the
compiler will not upset when it compels

599
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:44,390
and you can access to services from from
his life functions reverse engineering

600
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:49,069
you need to know the coal convention
because if you see a call to some

601
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,270
function or to some function pointer if
you don't know what is being passed the

602
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:57,759
order of the arguments it will be very
difficult to reverse engineer the city

603
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,360
to be binaries use the standard sea
convention so everything

604
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,490
his past understand nothing very
complicated as I told you you find these

605
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:11,549
in the SEC and the patient's don't ask
me the sixteen-bit I was reviewing the

606
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,410
slights and I don't remember the
sixteen-bit because there's very few

607
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:24,538
cold running in in 1616 it's an example
you can see everything the stack

608
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:31,009
deal on ESP thunderstruck normal
competency reversing 32 bit wineries

609
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:39,890
that used a convention that 64 bit
system Microsoft XP x64 convention so

610
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:45,699
the first for argument first four
parameters are passed on registers and

611
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:50,479
everything else under stack the core
difference and the first time you see if

612
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:54,379
I binaries of this kind you'll get
confused because there is a shuttle

613
00:55:54,380 --> 00:56:01,559
space of certain to whites on on on on
on the function very easy to understand

614
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,459
these with an example you have service
being called and this is the first four

615
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:11,729
parameters being used on the registers
as expected and many see the fifth

616
00:56:11,729 --> 00:56:13,239
perimeter like this

617
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:21,109
2032 bites have on the stack the first
time you seriously where are the other

618
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:27,499
arguments because the City two weeks on
the stock normally but the 64 version of

619
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:31,569
32 bytes as long you know this there's
no problem you know that certain devices

620
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:37,880
the fifth parameter in this case 64 a
fight ahead next perimeter so very easy

621
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,119
to understand

622
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:48,299
protocols and PDA's lights on this basic
services so that those services don't

623
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:55,049
allow it to do a lot of things but if I
is very modeler protocols and PPI is

624
00:56:55,049 --> 00:57:01,249
it's what makes make it more than what
happens is you can put a winery that

625
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:05,828
makes more services as well for example
you want to put

626
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:12,509
message to log function if I doesn't
have that what happens is you create

627
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:19,789
by binary that will make the function 22
my clocks available so you do you create

628
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:25,499
a function you have to attribute again
because like everything is going to be

629
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:30,149
funded bias and you publish that service

630
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:35,069
everyone that wants to use this service
basically needs to look up that service

631
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:40,009
is available if it's available you can
use it to get function pointer you can

632
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:45,769
use that there is a distinction between
protocols and PPI is they have a

633
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:50,799
different name I'm not sure why probably
because they are in different phases the

634
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:57,160
protocols are on the XE and PPI is on
the places in practice you can say they

635
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:04,479
are the same services the protocols and
PPIs are nothing more than get that

636
00:58:04,479 --> 00:58:08,538
defines what is the protocol and then
they contain function pointers and and

637
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:14,849
maybe some data by example I'm running
out of time this is the protocol it

638
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:22,380
doesn't get it says if I see ps3 safe is
this key so you always know that if you

639
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,829
call plz give you are calling this
protocol then you have the discretion of

640
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:32,699
the protocol we have two functions the
s3 say and they get legacy memory sizes

641
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:36,369
these are the two functions as this
protocol implements and then you have

642
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:41,539
the prototypes of speech function you
know this you'll find these gifts and

643
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:46,660
you can use this service

644
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:52,390
escape this is all you used the
protocol's first you locate the gates

645
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:58,430
and then use it if you have a valid
function pointer you can simply use the

646
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:04,529
service or the function pointers thats
that you got

647
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:12,860
let me go over these also feel very self
explanatory explaining Apple made some

648
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:18,740
customizations to be fine if you have
some doubts about this but it's very

649
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:24,850
easy to understand but contact me if you
have problems here I will have no tengo

650
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:35,589
time the Masters we can access the
contents we know where the pundits wakin

651
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:42,040
up everything what we want now is some
techniques to find potential rootkits in

652
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:49,650
a fight that the most important phrases
that because we need to know we need to

653
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:55,540
get the data from from from the flagship
always

654
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:01,090
from hopefully I make a very strong case
why I is necessary and then you need

655
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:06,400
something to compare with technically
you don't need because you can reverse

656
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:13,690
have refinery is like 200 or 300
minorities inside your your refund so

657
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:17,550
that will take like a couple of months
even if you are a very good reverse

658
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:21,860
engineer it will take a lot of time the
best ways of something to compare

659
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:28,290
against you can do I do that before you
travel or something that you assume its

660
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:34,900
ok I can use a place that Apple released
to compare against because in Syria

661
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:42,630
Apple those planes will be ok they will
not be attacked two plates from Apple

662
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:48,480
AAPL has a bunch of publishes a place
for firmware for example to fix my book

663
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,830
that to publish updates you can access
on the URL URL most of the plates are

664
01:00:54,830 --> 01:01:00,120
you can extract them when for example a
new version can be done and some

665
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:06,100
firmware updates on me last week Apple
released also new for marketplace so you

666
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,390
can extract from them

667
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:13,220
Apple doesn't publish his all of those
updates I'm trying to convince them to

668
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:20,180
do this so we can verify if everything
is legit these plates are only useful

669
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:26,970
for machines that resemble if there is a
new machine without the blades you don't

670
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:31,290
have an update to download so you cannot
compare anything against either you

671
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,970
assume that the machine has never been
tampered with

672
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:40,410
for example I open my micro because I
assume it could be tempered it stayed

673
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:46,259
like those in the united states and then
three days mark and in Germany probably

674
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,730
too much time and I assume these
machines might be compromised

675
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:56,090
greater problem in terms of how to do
this if the machine is very new one

676
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:03,840
solution wait for an update and then you
can compare you trust me I published on

677
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,170
on my guitar

678
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:11,450
everything I was looking for every form
word that there exists and I put their I

679
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:16,790
signed those from Lightspeed might be
cheeky my PGP key so it means that my

680
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:21,920
reputation is at stake if I put the root
keeps your own undies and if someone

681
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,810
finds it my reputation will be

682
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:31,540
it will be very bad for my reputation so
everything is extracted from available I

683
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,990
did my best to guarantee that they are
legit that are not tampered with

684
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:41,709
soon I will put the SMC updates there so
it's probably a very good reference if

685
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:45,910
you don't want to change or to download
yourself you can go there and you have

686
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:53,339
all the plates available to let me skip
these

687
01:02:53,340 --> 01:03:01,630
this is a standard for much what you can
do you extract the contents of these of

688
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:12,850
these plates and then compare compare
their dependents you have a different

689
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:19,230
view for example you have 50 capsule as
catalyst sometimes ends and then the

690
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:22,840
countries that you want to come to
compare with our inside another volume

691
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,970
so this is what I try to show you there
is a form of autism and their different

692
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:36,930
contents are there on 19 volatile region
on to UF microcode and three beautiful

693
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:41,710
women then it continues so it's not a
direct comparison you have to process

694
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:46,820
the plate file and find information and
then you can start comparing your

695
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:52,849
conscience techniques 22

696
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:59,589
to find the root extract to them they
fight content and then you compare

697
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:05,229
against the easiest way to start
locating all the miners and start

698
01:04:05,229 --> 01:04:10,109
comparing one-by-one you have one too
many match so it doesn't take that much

699
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:14,869
time computers are very fast and shake
some against if something is different

700
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:20,369
it's very suspicious you have to analyze
manually its the the the point where you

701
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:27,029
start reversing the binaries things that
you need to do you need to verify if the

702
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:31,160
contents IRA have been temperate but you
also are interested to see their new

703
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,269
files because there are two ways to get
either you modify something or you

704
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:41,399
install a new file also be interested
for example to cease their own any

705
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,009
missing files imagine some if I binary
that greater protection and you extract

706
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:52,380
the protection and get back to you also
want to analyze all the free and bedding

707
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:59,079
space that would be what I would use to
put would keep putting a new file I will

708
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:04,079
try to hide in the free space and then
the rootkit will try to find that they

709
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,779
think pretty tall are somehow so always
verify these data because it would be

710
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:17,109
interesting data they're also verify the
non-volatile RAM contents for example

711
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:21,640
the food device where the boot loader is
located is stored there so you could

712
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:30,589
modify the past their acting thing for
example to understand if they wanted to

713
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:35,779
restore the rootkit they put a variable
they're so easy way to detect tacking

714
01:05:35,779 --> 01:05:43,440
team is to see that variable exists in
the mirror and is for example the code

715
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,880
from hacking team what you can do is to
concede that they were doing this

716
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,789
function get variable to read is the
variable there if the variable with one

717
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:57,539
winning too excited system or 02 in fact
the system again if the system is

718
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:03,740
already infected we don't need to do
anything please

719
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:15,839
conclusions very sad if I read kids R
us' I would kids aren't unicorns not

720
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:22,630
many people talk about them I have no
doubt they exist I can develop one we

721
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,119
know they are very rare

722
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:30,020
there are not many samples from this but
my saying is these some presentations up

723
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:35,060
above least he talked briefly about
these we don't know what's out there he

724
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:42,890
talked about most viruses antivirus
vendors they ever samples they can find

725
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:47,230
the samples that they know involved but
what do you know about it brings another

726
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:53,010
very big problem especially if no one is
looking for any firewood kids I can

727
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:59,460
detect my machines but without enough
samples we cannot be sure that they're

728
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:05,320
not if I would kids are not out there is
one of the reasons for this presentation

729
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,910
is to get people to start dumping their
confidence to start searching for this

730
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:14,270
kind of mood states to see if they are
really out there and what is the quality

731
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:20,630
what is the techniques and so on so
don't assume that that they don't exist

732
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:26,830
this creates a very big problem changing
this type of food kids preheat acquires

733
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:31,640
artworks in most cases to dissemble
computers and for example in a large

734
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,920
enterprise I don't see the Japanese
enterprise with a big building everyone

735
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:43,369
going there to open the computer once a
month or twice a month or whatever

736
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:46,730
disabled everything to them manually
this is not feasible this is not

737
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:52,160
scalable so this brings big problem at
enterprise level I don't know what is

738
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,859
the solution vendors or hardware vendors
meet starts think about this because

739
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,430
this is important

740
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:05,259
an enterprise can be attacked with this
kind of with kids and then they will be

741
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:10,700
they will have serious apt not apt at
suffer level but the apt hardware level

742
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:16,080
and hopefully have convinced you that
these very very interesting stuff and it

743
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,609
will stay on the company for for a long
time

744
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:24,790
other problems in a fight the vendors
are very slow to release updates for

745
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:31,990
example my Gigabyte motherboard is fully
vulnerable doesn't use any protections

746
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:35,550
they are no updates no firmware updates
in terms of security

747
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:40,740
most of the vendors you line in this
situation it's a bit like Android

748
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,340
they released the phone or liberal is
the the computer they don't care about

749
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:50,540
them so we have a problem because if
there's any updates you can try to fix

750
01:08:50,540 --> 01:09:01,300
yourself this playlist think these words
picture some pictures if you follow the

751
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:06,440
Guardian case and snowed in case the
secret service GCHQ from

752
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:11,599
the UK demanded to destroy their
computer the funny thing is that they

753
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:19,410
destroy the bunch of chips and the main
question is are those ships that

754
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:25,009
destroyed interesting for with kids what
was the reason why they destroyed they

755
01:09:25,009 --> 01:09:30,430
could destroy them because they wanted
to just throw people they saying yeah we

756
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:34,310
are destroying everything because we are
going to cause fear order or do you

757
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:39,190
really know more about those ships so
these rings interesting research

758
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:44,870
questions if you want to research topics
for next year for present study looking

759
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:49,180
at this stuff at these ships you see it
you'll see on the slides there's SNC

760
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,969
there's Intel management also very
interesting so start looking at this

761
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:58,430
stuff you can find from China from China
boards and they publish they still on

762
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:04,420
the logic board diagrams if you go see
these diagrams you can see very lot of

763
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:09,000
interconnection between ships and CPU
and interesting does so there's a lot of

764
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,550
interesting research topics in the
connection between hardware and software

765
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:22,900
when this I'm trying to make the case
with many vendors or at least Apple we

766
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:27,620
need to trust the hardware if we don't
trust this I don't know if my computer

767
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,140
hardware has been tampered with and
every more money and more and more you

768
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:37,410
eat more chips into your computers for
example to the trip into trackpad is at

769
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,639
9:32

770
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:45,770
ship which is very powerful these days
so you can put a rootkit imagine the

771
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:50,860
truck that is connected to to some bars
that others interesting stuff goes there

772
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:56,200
you can do a lot of things from the
track but this doesn't make any sense so

773
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:03,269
many people for example AV bit guilty
because I'm NextGen easy I'm trying to

774
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:09,410
solve software problems when I cannot
guarantee that the hardware is crystal

775
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:13,860
this is a big problem and we need to
start thinking in different times when

776
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:18,280
it started getting the security from
hardware to software instead of Franklin

777
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,599
who like now from softer

778
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:28,380
2012 puts physical protection from the
old times there was a physical speech

779
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:33,180
where you put you when you wanted to
update you had to put the flash writable

780
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,920
we lost that we have no switches for
cameras for example we have no switches

781
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,470
for the week in your computer all my
machines have physically disabled the

782
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,980
meek have to open the machine and
disable the connection I do the same for

783
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,240
the cameras this should then be like
these we should that some kind of

784
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:57,460
solution to disable this is a computer
very fast is a Chromebook that it

785
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:03,690
contends that solution that solution
there's screw ear that you can I think

786
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:08,650
lock and the machine will not be able to
rights to the buyers so it's a solution

787
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:21,879
hardware solution to not let the machine
do not like the abuse be attacked over

788
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:26,270
time so but over time hopefully I've
convinced you that for my security is

789
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:31,980
very critical when it's Omar people to
do research on these we need vendors to

790
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:36,259
start thinking about these I had some
vendors some people in in China where

791
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,010
representatives last year

792
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:42,240
wanting to think about this interested
in this topic which is good I hopefully

793
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,460
there are people here that time stress
of the into this and we'll go back to

794
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:51,660
their companies and try to start some
thread to start thinking about that

795
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:56,240
firmware that how important it is to
guarantee the quality of their computers

796
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:02,469
didn't take me you have the blog the
email where I publish all kinds of

797
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:07,910
course feel free to contact me I will
try to help you as much as I can and

798
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:15,790
that's it and you could ever trust a
wholly created extra
