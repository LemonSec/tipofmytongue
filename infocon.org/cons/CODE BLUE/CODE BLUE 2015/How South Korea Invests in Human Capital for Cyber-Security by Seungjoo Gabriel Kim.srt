1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:15,830
afternoon my mommy's Jackie from the
create universities and then I teaching

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:23,500
the undergraduate and graduate students
in my universe is when I arrived here

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,150
I'm so surprised

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,509
three times first I'm so surprised

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,340
called Blue has so many spouses and in
the second time I'm so surprised because

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,930
there are so many ideas I heard up more
than 600 people attend here today so

7
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:55,620
very congratulation to this papal ticket
booth and I'm so surprised at their

8
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:05,149
because the step of the color blue
design one hour for my presentations but

9
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:10,679
unfortunately in my presentation there
are no source code there are no demos

10
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:20,090
and there are no audio and video clips
just attacks so I'm so worried that I

11
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,289
ripped my presentation will be all you
don't expect so don't blame me too much

12
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:44,340
about it if we have a special security
situations because the North carriers so

13
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:53,200
our government promote so many human
resources development problems about a

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,570
cybersecurity all the talk about

15
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:06,889
I wanted covered 7 topics about it first

16
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,550
politic talk about the cyber security
situations of South Korea and after that

17
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,510
I will show you what our government and
private organizations and academia

18
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,519
devote themselves to develop

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,240
about the cybersecurity and then I'll
talk about other promotion and education

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:46,750
programs of the South South Korea's let
me introduce myself yes I now

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:54,350
Korea University's exactly Graduate

22
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:04,230
University's our greatest school was
established in 2000 it was first for the

23
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,790
first time is established in the area of
the information security and then our

24
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:20,359
students in 2009 and 2010 I was serious

27
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:47,040
especially in 2012 our unique University
makin new education problems hold as

28
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,269
Department of cyber defense it is fully
supported by military sectors career

29
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:07,010
University Graduate School of
Information Security in creating the

30
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:14,620
biggest one in South Korea is a living
institutions in recession education

31
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:23,610
about cybersecurity we have 17 full-time
processes and to aging processes and

32
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:33,980
other eight provinces until now more
than 1,000 students created our schools

33
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,960
and they were in everyplace related to
cybersecurity over South Korea and

34
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,880
especially formerly president of our
graduate school called Jonathan Lee was

35
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,940
appointed as president

36
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:59,710
special adviser for the national
security

37
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:13,669
yeah I'm lucky man and the decision the
Chinese characters and then I got his

38
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:28,590
degree about the cryptography manual and
from the 1998 to the 1997 from the 1998

39
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,349
and to the 2004 I walked in the Korea
Internet and the security agencies for

40
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,020
the public sectors in there I was team
leader be a cryptographer technology

41

team and also the leader of the city
violation hearings in Pisa after leaving

42
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,270
Kisa I walked in this ongoing
universities for seven years something

43
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,870
that is something that university is
famous because of the Samsung because

44
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,720
something is main sponsor its annual
universities so something valuable to

45
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,950
the hazard departmental semiconductors
all of this series of department has a

46
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,990
full scholarship from some songs and
after their graduations they should work

47
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:32,520
for eight years in some some recordings
from the 2011 I worked in the career

48
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:44,729
universities and teaching materials
about the information security and also

49
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,340
from 2011

50
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:59,929
I made by organized hacking group called
the Haro and also I organized and

51
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:10,350
international security and hacking
conference call this week inside yeah

52
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:22,610
rowly let me introduce about how far is
established in 2011 and is an acronym of

53
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,180
the Pakistani Union

54
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:35,979
I think that this group is how is one of
the biggest association of enduring on

55
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:43,469
the underground hacking groups and
communities can carry this man very dry

56
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:58,490
very dry the man over there is president
of the Sao Paulo we also have a more

57
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:07,840
than eight honorable members Blackpool
security company and also the rehash

58
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:19,049
claimed to be established for offensive
security restrictions and security is

59
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,080
very famous

60
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:31,310

also we have a famous companies such as
I need cops and AC works in also an HTC

64
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:10,329
I i heard that Mr her releases its CEO
of the company and I heard that and its

65
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:23,329
HTC is one of the sponsors of this could
also responsible for the security

66
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:34,800
analysis and evaluation laps I made
these in 2011

67
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:47,660
fortunately I have so many Syrians in my

Valley of the us- and other good

70
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:13,200
practice is in my laps and and all of
them is also the Member behind you

71
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,810
yes let's start by talking about the
cyber security situation of South Korea

72
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:35,050
in career tribal warfare is not a
virtual one is really because north

73
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,819
Korea continues to expand its
cyberwarfare capabilities in every day

74
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:48,080
so in Korea and I S National
Intelligence Service is known as a

75
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,250
career CIA

76
00:10:51,250 --> 00:11:03,950
Internet traffic for detecting malicious
network activities according to Dan from

77
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,920
2010 to until be 2014

78
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:24,479
75005 attacks against our country our
government announced tap North Korea

79
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,680
Times billions of cyberattacks against
our government and private corporations

80
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:41,569
of South Korea

81
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,980
especially five years ago when she was
hit by a computer virus that took over

82
00:11:47,980 --> 00:12:00,660
20,000 comparison had dammit at banks
and a television stations and so our

83
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:11,740
government company handed bat north
Korea has a total of 6807 soldiers among

84
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:22,310
damn 1700 are dispersed and five
thousand and one hundred members are

85
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:30,540
supporting members

86
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:38,270
to narrow the gap between the North
Korea and South Korea our government

87
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:50,520
have been devoting themselves to raise
more security expert

88
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:57,500
let's not talk about the South Korean
government efforts to narrow the gap

89
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:09,780
between North Korea and South Korea have
a major government bodies related to

90
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:21,240
cybersecurity they important one is who
have national security office is harbor

91
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:30,690
of the South Korea and chief of the
peace organizations is equivalent to the

92
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,730
minister in rank

93
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:45,220
they overseas or the government
diplomatic and security policies and

94
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:54,259
legally time

95
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:59,589
another important part of our government
is and I i National Intelligence Service

96
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:08,410
is known as a career CIA exactly and
Cesc national cybersecurity centers on

97
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:20,289
the NIS is an important one and css3
National Cyber Security Centre of NIS

98
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:26,379
has a central point is a central point
of government for monitoring and

99
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:33,959
preventing cyber attacks in public
sectors and sometimes they cooperate

100
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:41,858
with the public sectors and military
sectors showed information and and co-op

101
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:55,369
for preventing several texts and so on
and also has a solid National Security

102
00:14:55,369 --> 00:15:07,919
Research Institute as government
affiliated agencies once and I make some

103
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:14,079
security policies for government sectors
tan and assault a quick technical

104
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,699
support

105
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:29,118
for the private sector's we have we have
a Ministry of Science ICP and future

106
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:43,929
planning on the IP there are two
agencies the first one is Lisa Korea

107
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:52,290
internet and security agencies once I
miss IP makeup artist than kiss our

108
00:15:52,290 --> 00:16:01,699
technical support and also there is
another agency called a tree is another

109
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:14,199
18 Dec is kind of R&D Institute the
difference between the case our NXT is

110
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:20,889
that actually a more focused on the
development of the fundamental security

111
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:34,619
technology career we have a city this
walk for the protection of citizens

112
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:45,510
personal informations

113
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:53,280
we have four more government bodies and
I Ministry of the Interior

114
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:03,079
walking for the e-government system of
the period and accuracy and FSS is walk

115
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:14,020
for the financial sectors also we have a
ministry with your friends and we have a

116
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:28,260
subcommand Cyber Command bees launched
maybe 2010 depending on the type of

117
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:38,500
attacks from North Korea as purely for
the exists for the investigation of PSI

118
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,880
per crime

119
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,910
yes and then let's talk about the
nonprofit organizations we have so many

120
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,630
private managed organisations related
with cybersecurity but the most

121
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,530
important one is why I see this means
the Korean city of information security

122
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:18,139
and cryptology it was established in
1994 promoting the academic mister she's

123
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:30,370
like I i CEO of Japan they host several
international economic conference the

124
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:36,429
famous among them the famous win either
I see I see skis I think focuses on the

125
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:45,990
new policy and research focuses on the
system and network security and also we

126
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:55,930
have a PCR hey I is that is
representative body for the warden 157

127
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,480
secured companies inside the period we
have more than one hundred and fifty

128
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:09,539
security companies on terror 2012

129
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:19,679
to the many things for promoting their
interest of the information security

130
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:37,480
industry South Korea

131
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:46,000
concert means the constitution of the
computer emergency response teams it was

132
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,090
established in 1996

133
00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:02,740
d'amato of the Second City's top I will
protect my informations by myself

134
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:13,090
the company members of the country for
sharing the cyberthreat information is

135
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:26,389
and it's time to respond against these
dumb as a box office of South Korea and

136
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:33,280
also we have many nonprofit
organizations but the important one is a

137
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:45,389
hollow talk about the school education
program of South Korea's or talk about

138
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:56,140
the university and college education
problems

139
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:06,180
the underground on the religious schools
we have thirty-six Department relatively

140
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:17,400
the cybersecurity and also in the
Graduate School so we have a 32 the

141
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:30,119
number of that these increases increase
in every year

142
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:40,519
University symbol university established
the first cybersecurity undergraduate

143
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:52,569
problem in South Korea and after top it
has been growing quickly every Muslim

144
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:58,289
University of some kind of a joint
educational problems with the cigarette

145
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:06,789
companies most of them have a full most
of the students of that joint problem

146
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:12,489
has a full scholarship of guaranteed
employment that means that after the

147
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:25,200
graduations they should walk that
supported companies

148
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,070
and also we have colleagues we have
eight colleges related information

149
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,178
security that difference between the
University problem and it and college

150
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:54,830
program University program has 84 Yukos
but college has adjust to your costs

151
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:08,918
year 2012 is very special in 2012
government was inspired by his rivals

152
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:16,559
target problem and made Department of
cyber defense under the Korea University

153
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:30,590
is a joint educational program with
their Korean army exactly cyber comment

154
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:40,658
mysterious of that department has a full
scholarship and after their graduations

155
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:46,630
they should walk the walk in the
military sectors for seven years as a

156
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:57,669
senior lieutenant Korea top one
percenters hearings in the national

college entrance exam can have other
missions

158
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:20,699
introduced about Israel's I talking
programs popular means the best of the

159
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,639
best in hebrew in 1979

160
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:32,039
Styles P target program to train the
nation's most promising high school

161
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,349
graduates for developing

162
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:49,799
high-technology weapons they spend three
years in sturdy and should have walked

163
00:24:49,799 --> 00:25:00,849
for sixty years in the military service
our program Department of cyber depends

164
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:10,178
defensive career he's worth inspired by
his target problem of Israel and also I

165
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:10,999
was serious

166
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:34,000
can get the financial support for
starter after day their obligations

167
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,850
deals with many aspects of information
security especially we teaching we teach

168
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:51,760
these theories about the patriotism and
strong work ethics because he's like

169
00:25:51,760 --> 00:26:02,490
double ax this world

170
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:15,980
in 2015 this year the team called a
tough call their first prize it is

171
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:23,320
comprised of a series from department of
some cyber defense and three members

172
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,669
from the korea-based korea-based
security companies and other two members

173
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:48,470
is came from Korean students who studies
in the you s

174
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,780
besides regular school education
programs we also have not regulate case

175
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:07,020
of problems we have to kind of
non-regulated vision problems the first

176
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:13,950
one is government to even try by the
kitchen problems and the other one is a

177
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:20,080
private company driven education
problems again the government even

178
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,980
education programs is divided by two the
first one is education and training

179
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,620
problem

180
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:35,289
public officers and the other one is for
the non public offices for ordinary

181
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:44,110
citizens

182
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:50,850
and also we have a private company
driven secretive occasion problems until

183
00:27:50,850 --> 00:28:17,469
2014 there are 25 private cybersecurity
training problems inside himself curry

184
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:26,390
public driven programs for public office
the first one is a system is managed by

185
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:35,140
and as all and it's all as I said before
and it's all these affiliate the agency

186
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:47,270
under the National Intelligence Service
of Korea and another one is it was

187
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,710
managed and organized by physically
internet and security agencies this is

188
00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:06,820
allocated invasion and then this is
located in it so

189
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,139
and also we have a government driven
education programs for non ops

190
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:19,199
non-public office the first one is the
first one is occasional problem

191
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:31,350
managed by kieso 2013 and it aims at
raising very highly skilled cyber

192
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:39,820
security experts until 2017 our
government plan to produce 5,000

193
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:55,389
government certified experts

194
00:29:55,389 --> 00:30:04,468
we also the GOP program this is one of
the best one in career is the best and

195
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,619
it is organized by

196
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:14,399
ITRI plea means the Korea Information
Technology Li Technology Research

197
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,119
Institute

198
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:25,619
special point of view POV problem is
that it has very strong

199
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:37,408
mounting problems they has a mentoring
programs to collect very skillful all

200
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:49,869
the hackers with young one most famous
actress in korea like a beast and

201
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:57,689
service and all of them

202
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:12,179
mantle of the pupae problem

203
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:21,309
was once entering into the beauty
program muslims terrence Cody

204
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:36,499
eight-month costs in Bab program has a
pic of form of survival programs so the

205
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:55,480
final 62 days really get around $70,000
for each person

206
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:12,240
I talked about the typical in case of a
typical among 13 members and members

207
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:26,450
came from UB students or mental

208
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:34,240
also government many to be online
learning site about the information

209
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:50,560
security every year our government
spends money to use the IIT least search

210
00:32:50,560 --> 00:33:03,320
capabilities of University of career
during 2002 the 2014 our government

211
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:17,139
spent four hundred and fifteen billion
Korea one of it-i capabilities of

212
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:28,840
university in this item problems there
are three or four four centers for

213
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:45,270
centers there are three or four slot

214
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:54,300
we also have so many cops

215
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:02,320
school there are lots of information
security class and also in from the 2006

216
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,870
and Psyche have been encouraging and
supporting security costs eight

217
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:19,130
universities until 2014 45 cops are
selected has supported by money became

218
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:33,260
intense on some very famous at the world
class at Korea University and go on at

219
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:45,610
Christ and passed him and also we have
heard so many fucking petitions

220
00:34:45,610 --> 00:35:01,920
conferences maybe Golden Pond Hockey
countries was how in career for years we

221
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,860
have three international international
hacking conferences depressed when you

222
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:14,230
step inside and the security code again
in the third one EPC and we have a

223
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:27,240
dumbass conferences and a white hat
hacker contest and discount and equally

224
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:39,220
each side is managed by the by how do
and our university and college is hosted

225
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:49,959
by the Korean security company called so
for him and also pues si was organized

226
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:57,780
by a Chinese company and also issued a
check on is made by he saw and white a

227
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,720
packet contest is managed by Ministry of
Defence and also the National

228
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:19,299
Intelligence Service and is supported by
the financial sectors and so on

229
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:37,270
begins at 2011 it was the by hacking
communities Haru and the careerist

230
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:44,840
increase calm and kiss her acct ravinus
are pre-qualified for the constitution

231
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:57,870
and from 2015 inside began contest for
the first time in korea we call it then

232
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:09,980
as the bug contest to be

233
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:17,350
and the other one is cokie DC's first
international hacking countries Imperial

234
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:33,710
and also the corrugated serious are
pre-qualified for the end of call

235
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:40,240
and the other one is a check on this
email is mainly managed by his heart

236
00:37:40,240 --> 00:38:00,890
disease August one but domestic

237
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:19,270
probably activated in information
security country in the station and

238
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:30,890
Human Resources play a key role in cyber
security especially our current cyber

239
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:39,140
security situations pressure to invest
more and more in cyber security areas

240
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:59,770
our program also have some problems we
should move from quantity of growth

241
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:13,290
tutti qualitative crew you think we
should think about the right of the

242
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:24,910
hackers after the graduations all of the
all of the students graduate our problem

243
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:42,480
and get the real good job like doctors
and lawyers and so on and also we should

244
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:54,440
change the education of growth we should
change the educational goals from the

245
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:03,480
information security to the information
assurance

246
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:13,140
for example yes yes government have some
special educational program called as I

247
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,129
E P that means that National Information
Assurance education and training program

248
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:36,980
this is a couple of the certificate the
education problem of college of the

249
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,609
University of the U S B

250
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:56,270
criterias of yes government can use
government give them the search came in

251
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:06,650
this case we cannot find award
information security is that we can't

252
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:12,080
find a water information assurance is
not information security education

253
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:25,808
problem is Information Assurance
education problems

254
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:36,719
the late of the nineteen nineties
Department of Defense of you use the

255
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:50,000
term information assurance

256
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,710
information assurance

257
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:04,400
with so many aspects like a security and
safety and the reliability now available

258
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:15,820
attention in ICT period not always
secretly but also has packed like safety

259
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,290
reliability and also available

260
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:27,700
becomes more and more important in this
case ie information assurance with all

261
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:36,270
of this aspect

262
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:41,759
their own should be safe from the
Packers and from the errors and from the

263
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:51,270
digested and so on so we should change
our focus from the information

264
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:59,340
securities into the information
assurance we need to do this we should

265
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:16,369
have every with all the experts in other
areas of the comparisons

266
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:26,359
so every time I said to my series you
should become a martial art players

267
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:37,100
start yes likely yes the

268
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:48,450
yeah it's all thanks all of you for your
attention and interest if you have any

269
00:43:48,450 --> 00:44:19,629
issues I do my best

270
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:40,950
why do even though they have they have
not not its infrastructure in January

271
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:58,560
why north korea yeah used by my career
army and government I thought it came to

272
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:07,410
have came to have such competence in
cyber attack are you human

273
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:16,790
why North Korea government support
raising hackers yea and yea though I

274
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:27,430
wonder why they have competence in
cybersecurity compared with other

275
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:37,020
developed country country north Korea
has no comparison no internet yes yes

276
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:57,240
yes I put to talk about these and what
some people asked about the same thing

277
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:13,270
I the dependence on the high-technology
the South Korea has a big dependencies

278
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:20,810
on the cyberinfrastructure we have so
many internet banking systems and

279
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:30,920
e-government systems and so on but north
Korea does not depend on the internet

280
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:41,500
much so they can attack so many points
of southern South Korea but we cannot

281
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:51,530
attack back because there are no second
period and then there is no internet and

282
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:57,990
furthermore most of hackers from north
korea are located in Europe or China is

283
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:05,149
doing so because of the North Korea
government support so many hackers

284
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:17,810
because the dead that's very practical
practical practical solutions for

285
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:24,119
fighting against the South Korea and
your second question is that there are

286
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:30,550
no computers Tennessee North Korea but
how they teaching about the happenings

287
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:39,690
to be very people you're right I heard
bout

288
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:49,930
there are so many good pictures from the
Europe and China zone so they teach them

289
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:56,990
about the information security and
hacking their song and also there is a

290
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:08,529
report that analyzed the computational
complexities of North career in that

291
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:22,079
report the Arthur pointed out North
Korea as as as an alternative you know

292
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:30,130
that India is very strong for the
software technologies North Korea is

293
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:45,240
normally nominated as alternate even its
ok im gonna go through my sympathies

294
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,399
your car

295
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:01,250
sorry no offense but I'd like to know
why do you think

296
00:49:01,250 --> 00:50:01,980
Korea is the most active country in Asia
I think that one of activists coach

297
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:10,460
that situation

298
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:16,859
yeah it is very important that we should
expand job opportunities

299
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:26,500
good job opportunities for trade hackers
but in case of Korea there are very few

300
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:39,369
global security companies so our
government try to make some security

301
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:45,060
space 3 Department inside of the global
company like as Hong Kong and a

302
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:53,630
gentleman and then probably be some
amenities between the small companies in

303
00:50:53,630 --> 00:51:02,290
the POWs scary so how so how to yank
companies so it's much better to have

304
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:09,000
some solace special security department
in the Indus corporate government and

305
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,130
motivated Korean companies to have those
security space vehicle department so

306
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:25,880
because the company is also need two
more cost money but that's very

307
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:37,130
difficult so to the best of my knowledge
we don't have clear solutions about it

308
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:48,780
just sayin say it's a game to the global
companies but but nowadays

309
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,770
nowadays Samsung makes them

310
00:51:52,770 --> 00:52:00,980
I think that Samsung has some plan to
make big decisions related to be the

311
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:11,910
city really bad people will will retain
control all of the part of the Samsung I

312
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:30,850
heard they were similar they must got
doctor I just haven't smoked question

313
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:39,160
about the education here to do you think
in your opinions for cybersecurity

314
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,660
education and general education
university to think any difference

315
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,000
between the sides

316
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:57,480
record precious yeah but I think that is
saying I think the then when we make

317
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:07,410
Department of cyber defense we combined
to cart comes to put one thing is from

318
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:14,379
the computer science and European is
from the information security so in

319
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:24,320
everything in our universities muslims
tutors should finish should cap one

320
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:37,920
hundred and thirty-five credit but
Department of cyber defense W patient

321
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:47,099
finish it the more than 160 170 credit
because we combined the essential

322
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:54,579
something from the computer science and
information security so you mean

323
00:53:54,579 --> 00:54:02,059
students you should be equipment more
demands knowledge and the MoMA practice

324
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:09,280
no I think that basic understanding
about the basic technology in their

325
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:18,210
damage is very important but most of
young hackers tend to just learn about

326
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:26,480
the hacking tools and I saw on making
sure have to preside over the year

327
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:35,619
general neurology different view because
sometimes we maybe try to happen and

328
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:44,069
specific attack but in general view
maybe it'll be good defense so sometimes

329
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:53,160
students they have some turkey arrested
about that we say more but in case you

330
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:05,670
know case we cannot reach about the
domain bathroom knowledge is because we

331
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:14,569
cannot see the detailed data about it K
should belong about it after their

332
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:25,329
graduations like an encounter with a
medical factors so I think that in the

333
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:33,940
education program about the information
security it is very important to relax

334
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:39,869
to make some relation with the
internship respective companies

335
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,589
ok I got it thank you thank you very
much

336
00:55:44,589 --> 00:56:01,910
those took a tour of the white hocker so
in case of Japan I think the white

337
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:12,078
hocker the security engineer is kind of
volunteer because they count how many

338
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:21,569
saudis so but in case of security I
think the money is very important topic

339
00:56:21,569 --> 00:56:29,990
so how is seen South Korea very good
very good factors also serve South Korea

340
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:34,118
now there is a very money

341
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:49,690
salary is very important point when take
a job but we sure as to our South that

342
00:56:49,690 --> 00:57:05,400
they hockey's becomes an office in good
university we shoot

343
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:16,650
considerable p on other opportunities
for some reason there is someone I think

344
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,819
so

345
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:22,308
ok
