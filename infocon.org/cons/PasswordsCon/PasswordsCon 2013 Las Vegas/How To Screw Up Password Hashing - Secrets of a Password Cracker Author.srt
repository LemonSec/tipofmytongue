26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,760
brown

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,590
restaurant German spots clearly users

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,770
and so

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,950
why it was lower is

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,229
what I'm and

31
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,170
basically this review matter on reviews

32
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,099
the speed up %uh for our a

33
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,238
for Osos high yes lover

34
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,769
a point out how does rather this

35
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,159
the first i think thats

36
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,640
really matters is or onto

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,950
wouldn't be defender were good web
server or

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,078
Asian server were out whatever I'll

39
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,480
is it really runs out for x86

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,950
or possibly RRC you you know today is
our

41
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,189
I usually have no lol

42
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,629
and hope you have is a so

43
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,899
all-knowing Ruiz that you all

44
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,099
we have their I remember any SEC

45
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,099
for RC you in the data center this point
has a

46
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,888
varies as EU or on our site here

47
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,889
says and so that's not a defender ass

48
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,090
the EU as hackers should be

49
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,650
as a really the same hardware

50
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,359
available to know they said the jews
there are so many more events that occur

51
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,760
after the the better

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,739
and it was terrible from there because
the matters anymore

53
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,999
we have to use and it doesn't even know

54
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:35,790
possible yes not on them out any

55
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,939
Martha yeah PCL up three birdies

56
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:46,090
not be 2013 forty-fifth uses happy to
see the problem

57
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,099
is higher without pair on me

58
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,230
attackers also possibility yes

59
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,869
to the site do so it's not true all
right now

60
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,159
mine other or certainly on the site gay
sufferers

61
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,659
and finally the hackers

62
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,749
clue they want to use a is I actually
see is

63
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,909
her mind he simply in that I'm

64
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,969
yes you know cases for the password of

65
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,500
no the problem on probably easier race

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,639
it while that he's or

67
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,190
shooter passwords fire

68
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,150
proportionally

69
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,729
Lucy our rooms day years were

70
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,910
because also you know crews used a don't
think he is

71
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,530
%uh I'm sounds as though so you're not
using the old

72
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,119
yeah and their using their

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,190
so really well done with all that

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,880
fired yeah show only other scorer

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,300

119
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,090
better side and really probably should
be because they have

120
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,659
for or right there as EU

121
