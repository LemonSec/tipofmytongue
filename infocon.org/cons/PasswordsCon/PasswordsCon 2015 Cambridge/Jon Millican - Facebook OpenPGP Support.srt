1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:08,780
i'm john I'm a software engineer on our
security infrastructure team in London

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,189
AP GPK in case any of you can harass me
to come here and just talk a bit about

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,770
what we did what we did it and then to
technical details on how in case anyone

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:30,830
else wants to do it so without further
ado what did we actually do we have this

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:38,589
profile failed the PDP case allowing you
to enter into enter any ok as expected

6
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:43,890
to play a fingerprint put it up for
download by anyone and then asked us to

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,390
encrypt emails to be sent to you at them
so that email from Facebook will

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,399
henceforth look something like this

9
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,089
least we will once you've clicked on the
link and one of these emails which just

10
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,670
checked that you actually can so we
don't like mark you out of your account

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,250
because of your password reset email to
some key that you don't know how to use

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:15,990
so why don't we actually do this do
anything good for us or anyone with this

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,869
classic split up into two questions why
would you want to use it so sharing a

14
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,800
key on your own profile what benefits
does this bring you over say the key

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,140
service or anything else

16
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:38,720
well discusses the key service can be
pretty ambiguous this is a search for a

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,950
colleague of mine who also worked on the
project is a huge list of his keys some

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,470
of them actually has some of them were
some of them he never even had the

19
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,119
private people but you don't necessarily
know which which he still actually use

20
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,190
it particularly if something isn't
expired because anyone can upload any

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:09,160
key to the service if you want this
disambiguation will wear a shirt from

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:17,109
the GPG can't work it suggests posting
it on your personal homepage and sure

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,500
this is actually a great option if you
have one which is sort of less common

24
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,269
now and certainly facebook is now one of
the places where you may go to look for

25
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,390
someone to contact details that makes
the sort of makes sense in that contact

26
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,798
tab on your facebook and also maybe you
just want privacy and sharing it with

27
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:43,079
people posting it on the case of its
very public but we've added the private

28
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,540
look the same privacy controls to be up
to any other field so if you want to

29
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,660
just share it with a select few people
maybe it contains an email address that

30
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,950
isn't publicly attributed to you or
anything else

31
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,060
indeed a name that you don't want to use
publicly but you do privately then you

32
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,160
have this option within the Facebook
interface that you may not within other

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,900
sharing mechanisms so then if you are
sharing a DNA profile what why do you

34
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,200
want to receive emails and credit from
us well if you are really concerned

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,339
about things that always being secure an
in-flight and perhaps you're concerned

36
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,910
about the start TLS downgraded tax
agency that scene out in the whales and

37
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,640
reported on by the or

38
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,208
perhaps you're very concerned about the
data want it's got your provider either

39
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,280
from the integrity of your provider or
anyone else or need the security of a

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,580
provider or anyone who just has access
to your out even if they provide housing

41
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,940
and this is of course we're has point
comes up that password emails recent

42
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,840
emails really should be sent securely as
securely as they can

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,830
this is the key to your entire account
so this was his request

44
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:12,420
roughly remembered from and turned out
and finally when we send the emails we

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,519
also signed them with Facebook's own key
and so it gives you slightly stronger

46
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,830
assurance of the email actually is
coming from facebook so that's why you

47
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,800
might use it but what benefit does it
bring to Facebook people were very

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,940
confused about this point when we
launched but really it's obvious that

49
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,840
makes people safer we've kind of got a
trend with trying to secure better the

50
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,719
communications between you and Facebook
we started a few years ago using TLS for

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:56,700
the whole sites we you start TLS emails
were wherever we can we then added the

52
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,650
only insight PGP encrypted emails was
just sort of the next step is this was

53
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,479
another band through which we
communicate with people and had no more

54
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,750
secure way of doing alongside this of
course you get the throng authentication

55
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,590
and your communications and this just
makes Facebook a safer place for people

56
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,369
to communicate and confidence if they so
wish to

57
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,639
and the next step is really just to set
a precedent for a group of a group of

58
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,530
engineers who built this site we just
wanted to see this on the rest of the

59
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,130
web

60
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,389
well the best way to try and make this
happen is to add it to Facebook and see

61
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,800
if that encourages anyone else do we
were delighted that this point was

62
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,949
picked up in the media and then that
people started tweeting to complain that

63
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:55,130
Facebook was the only provider providing
this and asking perhaps their banks to

64
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:02,830
do the same for the statements and that
they have them so there's the motivation

65
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:11,750
is what we did how did he do it but it
is actually not to tree we started just

66
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,660
looking at the profile field aspect of
it so we rented cars around just to take

67
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,180
the keys the fingerprints and some basic
data about them

68
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:32,250
verify that they actually are keys then
we created a backhand service which

69
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,760
actually does hardcore lifting this so
strongly verifies that they actually are

70
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,099
a key by using them

71
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:48,599
GPG and then actually take them to a
tattoo incorrect we put this all

72
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,370
together with the various points in the
facebook status so the profile field

73
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,280
mutations email stacked just before it
gets sent that space at the job done

74
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,340
that looks something like this you claim
this occasion

75
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,859
we accept it we don't intend to pass we
check the head of a dusty armor which I

76
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,199
but it claims to be a public key
particularly don't want private keys to

77
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,860
be sent to us for obvious reasons we go
in like in the content and again check

78
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,380
that the content like ballads that the
contents are actually a private key with

79
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:36,030
that had is changed to say public for
whatever reason and then we sort of take

80
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,080
out a few bits that we don't need for
example user attribute types these can

81
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,240
be pretty huge images

82
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,600
there's no reason to be sending them
across our infrastructure as we don't

83
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,060
use them and then we really really
coalition to ask you make sure it's

84
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,070
instead of the normal form so that the
fixed line with etcetera and then sent

85
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,240
back to main mediator which echoes in 10
stops and adopt this back in service

86
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:13,090
which imports the Quinta GPG in an
apparent sorry teacher and pulls out all

87
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,780
of all of the data relating to it so
specifically does it have some keys

88
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,190
spirals of all the relevant keys would
have the capabilities how can we use it

89
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:30,990
then sent back to results store it start
with its Privacy date of course should

90
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,190
know that the key to be stored here is
not the normalized 121 that we were

91
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:44,890
originally given and then we just
returned as access to encrypted email

92
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,890
notification it's very similar the
notifications get triggered somewhere in

93
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:56,189
Facebook's we don't really care where an
email is built we take a look at this

94
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,080
the recipient have a case if so we do
exactly the same normalization step so

95
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,740
that we're always sending consistent
thing to a backhand service send the key

96
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,850
and they just signed in this paper sorry
the data to encrypt ensign specifically

97
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:25,410
the entire my body of email get it back
and just fired off and again pretty much

98
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,130
done it's really not that difficult and
I would encourage anyone to try it

99
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:37,959
that's all I've gotten that was faster
than in my other on so we got back

100
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:47,378
sometime if you wish

101
00:09:47,379 --> 00:10:25,619
automated recording reporting according
to Michael that's all so basically we

102
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:33,039
don't save that one we only save the new
form of the que no particular

103
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:51,329
architectural reason there was it was
just easy to do it this way we decided

104
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:58,299
we display should be what the user has
provided to us if they choose to provide

105
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:04,439
us something which with GPG will accept
but is completely crazy for whatever

106
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,858
reason we decided at this point it
wasn't really a business tell them they

107
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:18,529
can't do that and start mutating it
potentially future versions well we'll

108
00:11:18,529 --> 00:12:02,809
change that model but we haven't seen a
need to yet then just look at the data

109
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:09,049
so this is a verification that GPT
actually can import the keys and it's

110
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:13,839
getting date of his then useful to us so
that later on we can determine should be

111
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:22,870
displayed incorrect email check box for
example

112
00:12:22,870 --> 00:13:15,930
and when you launched it was yeah we're
all talking with my operating system to

113
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:22,410
deploy

114
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:30,510
between the hundred and twenty thousand
clients and I remember doing that for

115
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:41,910
more than five years for damages project
manager was a massive job losses ready

116
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,770
so in 600 height 430

117
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:55,810
ok deployment not three minutes
afterwards ok now one point four billion

118
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,819
in the box

119
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:15,970
actually at that point goes topless like
I should perhaps I should be amended

120
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:52,250
only did three hundred million at a time
when you are the first lost money

121
00:14:52,250 --> 00:16:15,980
we don't have many

122
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:27,320
but that includes

123
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:36,090
remove the key so if they want wish to
enable if they click the checkbox to

124
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,400
encrypt email notifications and there's
no other way of covering that password

125
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,689
available we'll show them a big big
warning message saying are you sure you

126
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,880
want to do it if you lose this and you
lose your password will be locked out of

127
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,439
your account but that's about all we do
we want them but we don't want to stop

128
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
them cuz it's much better to fail

129
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:23,720
closed for some people to fail opened
and something like this

130
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:44,400
i guess i mean to do today but it is an
issue that needs of course socializing

131
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:53,400
around lots of people to pick to pick it
up and it needs socializing around by

132
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,270
people who do understand it so I think
this audience are the right sort of

133
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:06,230
audience to educate others cuz if
someone does sort of they did they take

134
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:13,559
a look at how to do it they managed to
set it up but then they forget how to do

135
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,350
it and they don't know anyone who is
able to help them then they risk locking

136
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:41,799
themselves out of their account for no
reason I'm sticking with it is a

137
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,740
positive integer

138
00:18:43,740 --> 00:19:16,920
private case it its words with passwords
on a scrape them obviously we're not

139
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,960
storing the password will restore his
reputation and you can see Alex talk

140
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,050
from last year

141
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:28,820
see how that's how we do that but it is
at some point submitted to Facebook

142
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,790
whereas with their private key this is
something that we definitely should

143
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:44,270
never see links to all pretty much
holding previous conferences on the

144
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:56,770
video recordings from bed to talk about
same rate to talk about the whole place

145
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,879
that stores your possible should be
relevant to pretty much the entire

146
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:08,090
audience so

147
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:25,459
moment so the only instance we should
see a revoked key is if they actually

148
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,330
upload it to Facebook themselves in that
instant swedes sort of we take a state

149
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,918
of that we've got back from the PDP
service and say OK disk is not usable

150
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,289
for encryption will let you display at a
low profile but we won't change the

151
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:45,520
checkbox the more interesting cases
actually it was a key expires so it has

152
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:54,260
been credited before but it's now not
able to do that and we do just failed

153
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,480
closed

154
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:06,480
hope that they will log in and what
their part and at some point

155
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:15,790
because we're not synchronizing with the
key service at all at this point we

156
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:38,760
wouldn't know

157
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,730
enabling this does not change any of
your other security settings but if you

158
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,450
do if you do have trusted contacts
enabled then we won't show you this big

159
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,220
scary account lockout warning when you
enable them but if you don't then

160
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:03,390
there's no other method and we will
thank you very much
