1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:10,379
thanks so what i'm talking sufficient
word lists why you don't need 25 gigs to

2
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:17,050
be a pro and basically the talkers is
serious around a wordless and how they

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,610
can go from being something we may take
for granted and use very quickly we just

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,140
download them and throw them at possibly
trying to correct how we can get to be

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,260
actually quite distinctive for what we
want to do and what we want to

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:37,609
accomplish so as I mentioned my name is
dimitri I'm a penetration tester and

7
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,960
passports with Becca just to answer the
question about the academic I don't have

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:50,440
an academic backpack good academic
background among team has cut and I

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,318
didn't hurt too many GPUs in the making
of this talk although depending who you

10
00:00:55,319 --> 00:01:01,749
speak to there have been some that have
been set on fire in the past but

11
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:14,690
starting with the cash than 150 alt I
thought we'd go for mister serious cat

12
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:24,610
is very serious about his word lists too
so he's basically a cat for this talk

13
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,410
right so why the store the reason is
because many of us whether we

14
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,490
researchers were hackers pain tasters
students or just the average Joe we may

15
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,559
have tried to crack passwords either
we're trying to export we're trying to

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,180
get into it maybe we do do it as part of
our work regardless of what we do we

17
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,010
get into a position where we're not sure
how to effectively use our service in

18
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,130
order to crack pass passwords those of
us who made crack password you may be in

19
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,880
a position where you bought a wordlist
you think it's going to be very good you

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,030
gonna get something out of it

21
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,970
alert everything up your local hashes up
stand back ups go and that's what

22
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,150
happens right so it can be very
frustrating because sometimes he's been

23
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,910
quoted the time downloading wordless
depending where you come from pitching a

24
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,040
$25 the Internet may take some time may
even cost you if bandwidth is expensive

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,100
and you're in your partner will you do
all of that and then you'll end up not

26
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,680
recovering anything it can be very
frustrating from their point of view so

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,959
how do we go about fixing that first
thing we need to look at is we we need

28
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,340
large bird listen we need custom or
small worthless right so if you look at

29
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,340
difference scenarios example I know the
patents on targeting and I want a high

30
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,489
success rate in that case you going to
use a small or a customized would just

31
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:05,510
write if your target is bombs hardware
store right you know she's users are

32
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,500
probably using prosperous to do
something like this would target a

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,560
financial institution right the company
name company location something about

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,799
the demographics about the company was
history forms a good or large part of

35
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,420
the passwords that have been chosen the
city with with a companies based

36
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,730
etcetera like that this morning
customized wordless would work better in

37
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,518
that scenario second ones are saying I
know about the passwords that uses

38
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:40,350
probably used coming back to actually
listen for example could mention some

39
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,720
possibilities there we'd probably had a
good idea

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,620
of what some people chose right but this
place for large wordless for just the

41
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,260
generic order one of everything thrown
into one place title would listen that

42
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,079
is if we have no idea what the password
could be so we don't actually know what

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,220
the sources to targeted don't know
anything about it in that case something

44
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,650
like that could come in handy there to
have a very large word list along with

45
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,330
your custom when all you had two cracks
example indy five in which case from ADP

46
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,380
perspective you're not very interested
in in in in targeting customizing this

47
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,920
to be a target a tech it's just throw
everything at it see if something comes

48
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:32,300
back so sourcing quality wordless where
do we go to get good word list 82 from

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,810
right how do we add this and work with
it so that we get something that

50
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,230
increases the efficiency of cracking for
us this place is the way it now when I

51
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,570
say that we're by no mean looking for
other people's wordless on the way to

52
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,150
talk about targeting websites to help
you build back to my original example

53
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,650
which financial institution or a back
scratch everything listed banks site all

54
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,330
the words all the things directors names
whatever you can find makes a good word

55
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,130
list to start off with from there if
it's a particular site in a particular

56
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,630
country particularly who is the target

57
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,290
well i'm for that and for websites and
get lists from those particular

58
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:24,200
country's next place is leaks and Julie
good for building word little bird list

59
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,060
because obviously their passwords that
have been used if it's elitist very

60
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,940
current that's come out now you want to
have passwords that you know we used in

61
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,360
the wild currently so you can add those
to worthless and build them up like that

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,860
as well

63
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:59,319
you get really good stuff on pace bend
his cars and they have made a really

64
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,560
nice tools for keeping a watch on pace
been watching what's happening with you

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,960
when I write your own go ahead and do
that patients are very good place you'll

66
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,060
be surprised that people put on pace but
it's it's incredible what they put on

67
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,669
their passwords configuration files want
to share my config file with a developer

68
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,758
so I went to email it that's too unsafe
or put it on basement along with my

69
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:27,289
equal details are looking to the D be I
seen everything from that to people who

70
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,680
stormed the home passwords their own
personal passwords on paceman

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,849
assumption that somehow no one else is
going to see it done and I think the

72
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,889
link is unique to them or what the story
is but you do get there so keeping an

73
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,479
eye on peace tunes a good place to get
these from somebody asked to his books

74
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,580
some books are good places to get to
passwords from right especially

75
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,878
passphrase for example by taking certain
sentences out of books I find these

76
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:01,060
books on the way we can get them in
electronic format dumped I'm craving

77
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,729
this from them and use them check the
effectiveness of the books are more

78
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:12,818
broader sense of a possible source but
they do make a good one in the last one

79
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:18,460
is funny parts and honey honey pots we
had a talk around sending recent or

80
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:26,839
something similar yesterday so attackers
will be throwing at the site to try to

81
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,490
try and attack it be at sshit parts
where based application and deposit it

82
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,909
at some time he's just us to find in
there what's interesting is energy

83
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,729
research if you want to do in your own
time I have tried to to is obtained a

84
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,320
leaked

85
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,219
you have access to honey pots compare
the two because what you often find is

86
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,750
when you leaks come out sometimes even
before they've been made public

87
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,510
you start seeing this passage hitting
honey pots because the guys obviously he

88
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,330
has connections in getting them they're
firing them all such a good place to get

89
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:07,599
access to these passwords now listen to
one man who won the item if you want as

90
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,030
hot as source prospects for your
wishlist there isn't done this because

91
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,570
this is two places to do that from the
second one probably the most important

92
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,870
one of them or one that we sometimes
forget to do your cracked passwords back

93
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,700
into your word lists again especially if
you run the rules mining rules and

94
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,860
brutal sometimes we do that we get
excited about the whole bunch of posers

95
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,690
last carries on those files could put by
the wayside or deleted when you actually

96
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,220
may have very good possible candidates
that you've created that you've cracked

97
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:49,180
but you could put back into word list
again so between those two you can

98
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,310
create a very good word lists both
talented ones and good broad ones to use

99
00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:04,219
for your attacks just on the point of
any parts sum of the parts I run have

100
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,680
come across some interesting password
candidates are I thought I would share

101
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,229
these processors detective tried against
the web applications again simply missus

102
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:19,100
mistakes to what to what we saw as well
is that they seem to be sending the user

103
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,510
and the password the same password
fields anyone to try some very strange

104
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,560
things I'm not sure who would use that
as a possible but

105
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,239
trying to understand how do the contest
or do they just very strange but we had

106
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:45,450
a good place to get these passwords and
to enter at them but we've got all our

107
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,660
list all I would need to process them
once again I'm going to have a large

108
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,380
list of recent ones which we combined
with rules which also called the

109
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,000
mangling of different password candidate
just plain candidate to crack passwords

110
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,930
to rules will take a password or would
do something to it

111
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,640
capitalized at lower case it added
remove a digit now because those run on

112
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,580
CPUs and GPUs they're more efficient
than try to have a date date to follow a

113
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:23,180
text file full of those words and trying
to crack passwords from them for example

114
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,609
if you look at the words here there's
ten words on the screen right now or

115
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,810
already you prolly find a base would in
all of this because the human rights

116
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,979
very good at that story susser doing
that well but what's interesting to

117
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,230
notice is these ten words here that
could have been in a dictionary that I

118
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,480
would have been using to crack passwords

119
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,440
effect using just a default banking
rules that you get in has cut and John I

120
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,290
could hit all of these possible
candidate if I were to correct them from

121
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,599
only one would somebody actually would
actually only need to contain the word

122
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,700
Mercedes to get all of these using just
the full rules that come with these

123
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,400
tools would even have to develop you
don't want to that's what helps in

124
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,209
making a wordless efficient why have 10
words in it why get your GPU's to idle

125
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,650
trying to do 10 words when you can give
them one would hit them with a whole

126
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,370
bunch of rules and get them to try
different iterations different mandating

127
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,000
until you get what you want but she
thinks

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,200
the key here is make CPUs and GPUs work
not hard disk's discuss super busy and

129
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
cracking passwords

130
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,560
well you may want to look at what you
doing it because it should be on GPUs

131
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,319
and CPUs that are being kept busy with
the cracking so removed what you don't

132
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,180
need and make you would miss smaller so
special characters we don't need that

133
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,410
and wordless even the most basic rules
and manly rules will try special

134
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,949
characters on your passwords leaves
speak they are many different rules to

135
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,400
delete keeps a white house that in your
password just leading and trailing

136
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,470
numerics right password 1234 password
2015

137
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,370
only need the word Password in the in
your watchlist rules can handle

138
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,090
everything else around for most of the
past which are trying to create anything

139
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:28,640
of use capitals duplications and then
mangled what's what's remove these

140
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,180
forward Luis Cruz rules can usually do
show more effectively in trying to have

141
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,209
every possible combination of one that
you can get so looking at the practical

142
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,980
side of this now how do we practically
show the difference between inefficient

143
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,940
or just a very large word list versus a
more efficient so there's a torrid call

144
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:57,130
her the resort and what it basically
does estate optimizes wordless now so

145
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,550
there any tool available

146
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,760
other guys have written the tools you
want them to try Roger your little ones

147
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,000
in your preferred language I mean it's
important to you can pretty easily see

148
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,180
what exactly it's doing the goal of the
tool that is to take big word lists and

149
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,400
give us something that's effective
that's targeted at shop when added with

150
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,470
rules and manual rules so we increase
our cracking deficiency

151
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,510
looking at some examples of what it can
do

152
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:32,200
max links will remove your words over a
certain length next room water more

153
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,180
words over a certain length we can trim
the end of words because the rules can

154
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,060
do that sorry don't want that we can
trim special characters from beginning

155
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,319
and end of words we don't want that
either we can remove duplicate words

156
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,190
words words can become just words but
even your basic rule states with your

157
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:57,640
tools will do that kind of attack no
sentence basically d sentence he fires

158
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,160
words by taking away the spaces so your
your sentence becomes one long word

159
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,990
convert everything to lower case even
your most basic rules basically every

160
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,830
single man doing it at some point we'll
try capitals capitalizing everything

161
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,050
capitalizing certain character so
there's absolutely no need to have the

162
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,140
senior workers keep them all lower case
we decide basically take sentences and

163
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,100
make some new words example of that just
now no numbers removes any words that

164
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,000
are only numbers numbers are very quick
to brute-force foremost hash so they can

165
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,140
take up quite a bit of space and a
better word list that you don't really

166
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:45,930
need many links removed everything below
a certain length detail removes tabs to

167
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,609
do because since Beijing takes a
percentage and ignores the wood if any

168
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,950
single character is over the threshold
of that percentage if I have a word of

169
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:02,860
it is intended to today BC I have a
threshold over 30 or 60 percent they

170
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,680
look at it and say well then that makes
up the majority of it

171
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,489
would we don't want that would be as
many rules for duplicating first and

172
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:18,210
subsequent it is in words so I have that
in the word lists a shrewd move is the

173
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,220
to basically remove hashes inwardly
species have downloaded large publicly

174
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,899
available wordless you often get hashes
in there or even for example if you're

175
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,560
going through what you honey pots has
collected is awesome hashes in the words

176
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,569
they were probably sent by accident or
someone thought the passing a hash would

177
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,770
get authentication for them you don't
need that so it will look for and remove

178
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:47,089
all kinds and jillian sharpe triple A
six months and so forth

179
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:52,700
email sought an email split basically
email short takes an email address ago

180
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,940
word list so

181
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,029
gmail.com and will create two new words
bump and gmail.com showing in trees

182
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,939
split I added because many guys like to
have customized wordless for usernames

183
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,890
and domain names so what they'll do with
religious instead of adding them to

184
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:17,160
separate words it automatically to
specify 2000 aims and output the user to

185
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,709
one and the domain to the other for you
or a pandemic and then deal with you

186
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,420
five is there to remove HTML tags and
also to HTML and

187
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,939
and other characters from some webpages
and tried to return was for you or would

188
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,720
lists for you combine that with no UTF
eight to get carried it done as part of

189
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,780
the UTSA Dakota city will see an example
of that just now so quite quite greasy

190
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,350
what does he think due to remove for
example if that was the input candidate

191
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,580
the output candidate would be that
tomorrow will be rainy if the input

192
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,210
candidate was that with the word five
function it within return those who put

193
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,360
words for you

194
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,699
example I gave you with deep center
seventy percent of Edward just would not

195
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:15,000
be included in the oxford shirt with an
email address would give you that extra

196
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,089
new words or email split would put those
into the particular found you specified

197
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,349
and then the D

198
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:32,520
it would take away the other markup and
give you just your word behind you so

199
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:46,320
you lookin example here's a file that we
had we've got we don't want based on

200
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,409
what I just said I'm sure you can
identify certain things that wouldn't

201
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:55,340
want in our in a wordless cuz we can do
that with rules

202
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,520
so we're going to do is give it to him
portrayal in this case will give it the

203
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:07,100
character text that we created and we
gonna convert everything to lower case

204
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:14,360
is output in look her case now you can
change the commands I'm changing them to

205
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,399
demonstrate this I don't recommend you
just do that because he didn't he just

206
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,520
sequences right you may come up with
wrong things like if you run a min link

207
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
first and then start trimming carried us
going to have tried is below the minimum

208
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,620
length ejection wanted to be sure to
order them correctly so here we have

209
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:38,699
removed it it's now special characters
are going so that when the agency has

210
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,850
not lost special characters you see how
the basement is starting to appear now

211
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:52,040
stripping everything we didn't need that
we could do with rules in the trial and

212
00:18:52,040 --> 00:19:00,180
then we've also got to want to fix as
well we wouldn't want that to change

213
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,860
parameters for their so you'll see why I
typed it wrong now because I change the

214
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:17,229
world it's not to do its move right now
we have just a basic work starting to

215
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,730
appear on that list so once you've done
that was very important decision sort

216
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,910
obviously and unique because we don't
want anything worse than having stuff we

217
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,720
don't even a word list is having
repeated stuff we don't need it will

218
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,130
cost

219
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:46,310
the next example is using a website and
trying to get some words baby side that

220
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:52,480
we can use in this case it's a Chinese
side to TV's the TV website so what we

221
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,510
doing this cases just scrolling through
it and see what is in addition to your

222
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,830
average page

223
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:16,120
different kinds of advertising a news on
on it so we take the URL

224
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,790
we're going to use that we get to get
the URL entry or how to use W get if you

225
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,430
want to have a good team from the web
page or two you can do that too in just

226
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:32,000
cut oil output files into a single one
so here we have this output Chinese

227
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:42,620
pages HTML content right sorry we have
Chinese characters that are not sure

228
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:55,929
where that we don't want it would last
all that junk surrounds very good

229
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,570
reaction would like to have chinese
characters in an hour or so let's get

230
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:13,100
rid of that

231
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:21,059
so we're going to be going to posit that
Chinese and we're going to use the

232
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:36,760
B-movie find command

233
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,050
but there's two issues here

234
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:49,440
well as we still getting some of them
takes from the mock up from XML we're

235
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,230
also getting quite a bit of English not
talking to you was to get Chinese words

236
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,230
out of this list we didn't just want
english words out of it doesn't really

237
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,300
help us to get there so we're gonna do
is run the same time and again this time

238
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:20,850
with the Utes no Uta eight

239
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,560
so now we have a lot more than just the
characters that were that we're looking

240
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,550
for in this file you will notice there
are still some characters floating about

241
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,510
that we don't want to miss you so much
going on out there was a number to the

242
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,500
reason for that is only check the first
character when doing the know your PSA

243
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,070
testing testing if it's worth checking
them all if it is I will update tool but

244
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,110
for now if we are to protect you even
have a final that we can use with

245
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,270
Chinese would listen and you can run
that she whatever tools you want to

246
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:12,910
actually process it and get output that
you can use to use quite extensively is

247
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:19,640
our ally it comes with hash pet parlor
suite of tools and what that does is

248
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,010
basically takes to listen gives you the
unique passwords between them the next

249
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:29,370
time you gonna have this multiple would
listen and which is what it is listed

250
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,909
this is actually my unique passwords I
can get out of it very fast too little

251
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:40,410
Nancy so quickly it's clean to use in
very handy to get the differences that

252
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:46,360
you cannot put your unique passwords and
then splitting which is short for speed

253
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,760
links is also has got to be very
important or something that you'll find

254
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,220
boost capability lot when you do it but
we split a wordless in two separate Word

255
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,220
files split by character 21 carried word
list two characters and so forth now

256
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,630
initially that makes him an intuitive
you gonna have a dairy free full of

257
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,310
files with different character links in
them but you can do a lot with it for

258
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,120
example you can take your full querida
file run that combined with a three

259
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,559
carat

260
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,980
join the two words together you can take
your character to character can take you

261
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,740
a painter and your nine characters join
them in different combinations or most

262
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,200
of the tools John and has cut included
just give it a directory and you can run

263
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,029
it as though it was your whole wordless
file anyway because they will run

264
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,289
everything through all the sub files in
the directory so you know to losing the

265
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:46,200
ability to use rules to use one word
list as it were but just putting them up

266
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,669
into manageable size files based on the
character link that you can use and you

267
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,610
can do quite a bit with us as well

268
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:59,840
case example in this example I
downloaded a fifty example has been on

269
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,090
the need for long as Cold Creek Station
. text it's 15 games once uncompressed

270
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:12,769
optimized using just the resort to land
a unique to it and I gotta down to 1.1

271
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:15,740
gigs

272
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,809
the two things within three years
obtained 20 random passwords from a a

273
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,499
leak which I won't name but it has
something to do with web hosting the in

274
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:29,679
the second test was the old LinkedIn
don't ashes from 2012 to all of those

275
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,999
and I ran those two so the goal here is
to try the 51 referring to a decision to

276
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:42,610
adjust that list class rules the brute
force just to see how bridge was

277
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,350
companies into a picture and then
optimized word list price the same rule

278
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,299
be used initially see what we can get
out of that and not just listing the

279
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:58,820
hardware that was used for this test
before you carry on just remind her to

280
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,379
order your tools correctly right so
don't run maximum links strips before

281
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:08,590
your word if I and you know sentence
don't run minimum links before trimming

282
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,840
the characters remember to unique in
duplicates in a wordless file to make it

283
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,249
ineffective run your numbers towards the
end because you may have trimmed words

284
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:25,669
down to only numbers and in spiritual
wordless accordingly in this case I

285
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,300
haven't

286
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,240
for this testimony attacking one
particular type of scenario but everyday

287
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,040
life keep your word Allah split by
character sorted rice crackers me out of

288
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,330
20 passwords without playing word lists
as I mentioned the pain rootless + rule

289
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:49,379
brute force optimized wordless second
option was cracked a higher percentage

290
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,770
of passwords with plain wordlist
optimized wordless + rule and so forth

291
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,060
so let's have a look at the results
right so first we have the plane word

292
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:09,210
list just the fifteen 15 out of 20 which
is the number is very good number to

293
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,790
crack password was right the other
problem with this is around seven

294
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,210
minutes that's not too bad that was
across five GPUs but that didn't matter

295
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:24,360
whether had 51 was a deeply utilization
was very bad at any city 3% we weren't

296
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,439
using rules we will manually or anything
like that so we didn't really give them

297
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,790
much work to do other than income then
comparing and generating clashes would

298
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:43,940
list the 15 big 12 schools to improve
the GPU something nice to do another

299
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,880
amex that at 200 percent credit 1420
passwords that a good number but we

300
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,550
increased our time right now was 65 and
its for this test not bad but also have

301
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,930
time to wait for twenty passwords to be
recovered in two runs through 15 would

302
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:09,340
love to but do we improve forced just
checkin up to 8 characters or carry too

303
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:17,050
so that everything special characters
including a polo case that is a question

304
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:22,460
mark is the placeholder for those cases
up to 8 characters very bad

305
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:28,150
exercise we didn't keep the GPUs busy we
also there were starting to set them on

306
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,950
fire a two hour on tops choice wasn't
giving us very good actually catch 22 I

307
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:40,800
was a run time it was estimated about 10
days or so if you're not getting

308
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:47,379
anything you dish but yes let this thing
run and brutal but in this case the

309
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,400
optimized wordless to 1.1 gig wordless
what they'd be correct

310
00:28:51,400 --> 00:29:00,460
1193 list that we did with the full list
right with the rules of procedure used

311
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:09,240
to utilize a CPU well he took a 6-2 to
run that because taking two hundred and

312
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,640
twenty minutes and brute force to
measure how much more we could have run

313
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,850
home rule combinations how much more we
could do without one big dick optimized

314
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:22,830
word list today is everything laid out
of 14 the screen for you to see so least

315
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:30,679
defectors was the word list only a
brutal brutal still keep I GPUs busy so

316
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,140
at least I think of what does the word
lists only and in most effective in line

317
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,340
was keeping GPUs busy lowest time and
most possible you could get in that

318
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:45,389
scenario was using an optimized would
list plus rules second scenario was the

319
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:54,410
LinkedIn one right in this scenario
would list only 24% 28 minutes to do

320
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:02,300
that utilize 61.4% of GPUs and there was
in the 16 gig file size

321
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:08,850
now look at the optimized GPUs get much
busier doing something now with the

322
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:14,620
rules us-based 64 in this case only 12
in one big file with you and we still

323
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:20,739
trapped nineteen percent 5% less than
using a 16 gig would last for three more

324
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,730
rules that this would have probably gone
way past that and even better

325
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,280
then we would have before

326
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,350
results for scenario to comparing to the
slaughter be up if you want to get them

327
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:41,540
later on today at the end of my total
basically in conclusion so efficient

328
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,860
wordless you can't go wrong with him the
more you manage them the more you rely

329
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,219
on rules to keep your GPU's busy get
them to do the work

330
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,919
new CPU or possibly would definitely
recommend the better you will do that

331
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,080
thanks very much
