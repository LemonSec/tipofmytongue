1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in the nineties I went by weld pond was
a member of the hacker group loft we

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,410
named our cells after the space we are
in which was a old manufacturing

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,698
building that had been converted to sort
of an artist's and no clothing designer

4
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:28,730
kind of space and we ended up taking
over a half a hat hat studio and in true

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,360
hacker form of the nineties we spell
that L zero PHT and we called ourselves

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,610
the loft has that's that's that that was
the physical space we are in we we we

7
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,860
had a physical space because back when
we started in ninety two you know there

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,350
really wasn't an internet we weren't at
the University we want to have a lab

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,850
environment where we could set up a
network we have shared machines that we

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,289
could attack and and do our security
research and we needed a physical space

11
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,329
to do that back then we're going to
share equivalent and I don't know how

12
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,479
many of you did research back in the mid
nineties but it was a thing called

13
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,409
computer manuals that we're like shell

14
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:16,850
and you know for VMs you had to have you
know ten foot ten feet of shelf space

15
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,530
for all those orange manuals so having
access to hardware and and computer

16
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:29,880
manuals was a lot more difficult back
then so we actually did this as I say

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,919
this was not a full-time job we did this
as a hobby and we did this outside of

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,479
work and we you know we we paid we paid
the rent and we we try to scrounge up

19
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,379
equipment in sort of corporate cast-offs
dumpster diving at the company's in

20
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:55,439
around Boston and Cambridge
Massachusetts MIT was all good spot to

21
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:05,678
get old equipment from so we started
doing security research on Windows sort

22
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:11,810
of in the mid nineties and that that was
kind of what I i specialized on some of

23
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:19,810
us did Linux some of us did windows and
so eventually we came across Windows

24
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,269
passwords and that's that's where I'm
from

25
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:29,530
talk about the history today it's hard
for me to believe that I wrote this

26
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,900
program with to my coffee one of my
colleagues eighteen years ago I'm still

27
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,940
talking about it now but it's amazing
how long

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,120
problems persist and arson are still
relevant

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,560
so I saw this sign last night coming
back from the pub and i were really what

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,900
it means but I figured I had to put in
my presentation because tracking is very

31
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,150
important so

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,599
just wanted to give a shout out to some
of the people that influenced me I don't

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,328
think we do this enough on the sort of
hacker security researcher side like

34
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:13,900
academia does because we all learn from
each other and a lot of times we don't

35
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:21,239
mention because we have not formal with
our references and things like that so I

36
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,359
want to call it some of the people that
were pretty influential to me you've

37
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:31,470
probably heard of dan farmer and BTW
venom who wrote this really great paper

38
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,109
in 91 92 which was securing your network
by breaking into it and that really set

39
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:44,519
me on a path of of of how I was going to
pursue security and taking that to

40
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,220
securing passwords by breaking them and
now my career I can become very code

41
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,189
which is about application security
securing applications by breaking into

42
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:58,420
them right so it's not about security
features right it's about what's the

43
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,000
actual implementation what's the ground
truth what's the reality and you know

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,120
transformer wheaties paper really helped
crystallize that for me and you have a

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,870
read it definitely want to check that
out another important papers specially

46
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,668
for a lot of crack was this paper by
Hobbit I don't know how many people

47
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:25,109
heard of Hobbit he wrote the tool called
netcat in the mid-nineties which I then

48
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,199
ported to Windows cause I was like hey I
want to explore courts and I want to put

49
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,349
back doors on Windows right so I ported
to Windows which wasn't easy because

50
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:40,060
Windows version of tcp/ip was a big mess
but he wrote netcat which was really a

51
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,010
seminal tool for network exploration on
Windows and he wrote this paper CIFS and

52
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,940
CIFS which was the common Internet file
system which is the name that Microsoft

53
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,650
was kinda proposing to the IETF to
standardize on a file-sharing system for

54
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,870
Windows for the Internet

55
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,890
and it ended up just being called SMB
overtime but you know he he call the

56
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,169
common and insecurity still scrutiny
because he started poking at it and

57
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:18,070
found it was a big it was a big mess and
some of his research and the

58
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,400
modifications he did the SMB client for
Linux to basically research at the SMB

59
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,080
protocol with some of the early early
stuff that I learned to look at the

60
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,460
challenge response protocol on early
windows which was completely completely

61
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,030
broken back in the windows ninety-five
and then of course windows ninety was

62
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,719
was was backwards compatible and of
course I have two mentioned and farmers

63
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,420
PwC which was really the earliest
password cracker therefore were famously

64
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,510
got fired a few years later from Silicon
Graphics writing a program called Satan

65
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,830
which was the first vulnerability
scanner and that was one of the reasons

66
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,659
that we used hacker names back then and
we released our tools anonymously or

67
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,520
pseudo anonymously because we didn't get
fired from my day job as a working at

68
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,530
BBN at the time which was a company in
Cambridge Massachusetts which helped

69
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,869
build the original backbone of the
Internet

70
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,900
in the united states and we did security
for that and we don't wanna get fired

71
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,260
because we saw what happened to dan here
guys that R rating password cracking

72
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,710
tools and they want securing you know
the Internet backbone we we we we

73
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,780
thought that might not go over very well
we eventually got out it but it was

74
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,789
later was around 98 and things were a
little bit more scene but really in the

75
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,990
early to mid nineties he didn't want to
call the hacker and have a security job

76
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:57,310
so the origins of life crack really the
key inspiration for a lot of crack was

77
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:05,990
when Jeremy Allison creative Samba
released PWD and his inspiration for

78
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,630
doing this reverse engineering work was
you know he wanted to be compatible

79
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,760
between Linux and Windows inti so he
wanted to see we are aware of those

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,370
hashes how are those hash restored I do
you generate those hashes so that I can

81
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:31,130
generate them on Linux and so he came up
with tw dump that did that now he wasn't

82
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,040
doing it from a security perspective he
was doing it from an interoperability

83
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,740
perspective but when he published this
on march 20 fours right away the mailing

84
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,650
list went on fire saying oh my god this
is just a horrible horrible mechanism

85
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,390
for for restoring hashes this is
completely completely broken windows is

86
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,539
completely broken and within you can see
here within four days

87
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,120
Jonathan Wilkins right to write say a
cracker for

88
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,470
for the land man hash and we're working
on at the time to like damn he released

89
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,220
before us so we like what we have to we
had to one up that we have to crack the

90
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,949
until I'm asked to write and now of
course the NTLM hash you can you can log

91
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,320
in on the console because you can't do
that with land many can only do that all

92
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:27,419
the networks so deftly that was cool and
one of the one of the that we really

93
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:34,659
releases a proof of concept but the
proof of concept was windows are broken

94
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,838
you know that was that was a hole that
was the whole ethos back then was

95
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,330
released a tool to prove that something
something didn't work because if you

96
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,720
didn't do that then no one would believe
you Microsoft would say that was

97
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,130
theoretical we actually came up with
this the tagline for the loft we had on

98
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,520
our homepage making a profit making the
theoretical practical because we think

99
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,420
if everyone just call the attacks
theoretical they didn't have to fix them

100
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,520
right

101
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,949
theoretically someone might attack it
but it was practically everyone can

102
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,370
download the tool then they would fix it
and that was some one of the early the

103
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,860
early in some of the early ethos of why
you had to create proof of concept why

104
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,580
you had to distribute exploits to get
anything fixed and I've learned over the

105
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,170
years that the unless the customers are
the product that people paying money to

106
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,089
the vendor unless they they can actually
run the exploit see that it works and

107
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,800
then go to the vendor and saying what
are you gonna do about it nothing

108
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,400
actually gets fixed and that's really
what happened with lock track although

109
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:51,480
it took them awhile took them awhile to
to to to fix it to just be entered the

110
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,990
windows enter your password hash
refresher for prayer for you that don't

111
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,649
know essentially they store in the land
man

112
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:05,559
cash in the NTLM hash per user in the
registry so they store in these two

113
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:12,170
hashers of the password together but one
was incredibly weak right one was a

114
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,269
split into two halves 7 launch of your
password was seven lawyer got you know

115
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:21,540
enough for the second half hour 48 you
got one character password for the

116
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:29,910
second half and 741 they use no salt and
they use singled as to to hash it so

117
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,269
even on a Pentium 133 which is sort of
the the machine that you could buy back

118
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,269
then for a reason it wasn't outrageous
amounts of money could go into any store

119
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:45,050
and buy it we can cycle through the
whole out in america space and I think

120
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,290
it was in two and a half days on a
Pentium 133

121
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,490
that's pretty that's pretty broken of
course dictionary attacks were you know

122
00:10:51,490 --> 00:11:01,829
minutes and in Microsoft of course when
we actually which started talking about

123
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,099
this to them and the claims they made
they claimed that their passwords would

124
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,529
take years to crack they would take
years to cry because they were thinking

125
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:19,029
of the the the NTLM password which was
you know 14 characters not uppercase and

126
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:27,189
and used believers are seen for a long
time and they made they made these

127
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:31,939
claims that that that that that was the
strength and it really goes back down to

128
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,860
you have to do the reverse engineering
work you have to see what the facts are

129
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,319
you know you cannot take any vendor
claims because they make mistakes you

130
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:44,248
know when I look at software and ISS
software of course i dooo threat

131
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:48,329
modeling of course I talked to the
engineers I asked them you know what's

132
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:52,359
the design where the data flows what are
your inputs to the program what do you

133
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,850
do with that data but then I always
inspect it right I was inspected what

134
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,360
files as it opened what shared memory
does it use what named pipes does it

135
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,179
create what sockets does it open cause
oftentimes the developers don't know

136
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,120
what they're calling a function at a
high level and some other activities

137
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,880
happening at a low

138
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,260
lol what they don't understand so this
is this is exactly a case of Microsoft

139
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:20,230
not knowing how their passport scheme
actually actually worked the other

140
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,400
really sad thing about this is this
scheme actually persisted for 10 years

141
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:33,910
it was the default scheme all the way up
until Windows Vista in 2007 over ten

142
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:43,709
years after this design flaw was was was
brought to light Microsoft they they did

143
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,470
some sort of quick patch which I'll talk
about but the actual design flaw

144
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,610
persisted for over 10 years which is
completely crazy so it shows you when

145
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,090
you make these design decisions and you
want to have backwards compatibility how

146
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,600
long the stuff persist into the future
so it's really important to get it right

147
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:12,040
so this one point out my age my
colleague wrote the command line version

148
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,540
and wrote the the cork tracking
algorithm and I said you know what why

149
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,589
don't I write a a GUI version this is
for Windows it's not for a Linux this is

150
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,820
gonna be so many more people who don't
understand how to run command line tools

151
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,550
that if we can say click here to you
know load load your password hashes and

152
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,310
click here to crack them we're gonna
we're gonna actually hit a whole nother

153
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:43,020
market of a system administrators and
users to understand the problem and I

154
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,770
think that's an I think that's actually
pretty important when you when you come

155
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:54,680
out exploits that are super hard to do
that our command line only it it it

156
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,170
limits the exposure especially to the
customers who are the ones that are

157
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,510
going to actually make the difference to
effect the change to force the vendors

158
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,160
to do something so whenever you see a
tool and we deride him as script kiddie

159
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,949
tools we see sequel map and it's a
script kiddie tool makes it easy for

160
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,160
anyone to hack sequel in a website the
guy who hacked TalkTalk probably use

161
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,060
something like that

162
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,900
that you know those are important you
know I don't arise script script kiddie

163
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,040
pools because they give exposure of the
vulnerabilities that it was really hard

164
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,250
to do they would be less likely to get
fixed

165
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,820
1.0 it all it did was cracking imported
the PWD format and then a little over a

166
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,080
month later Microsoft responded with
their essentially security theater patch

167
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:51,780
which was called it SYSKEY and basically
all they did was add some obfuscation to

168
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:58,439
the registry where these were stored and
of course it just took a few more months

169
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,360
for people to be obfuscated that and be
able to dump the password hashes again

170
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,460
and then they didn't do anything else to
fix it right I think later they added a

171
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,360
registry key we could stop adding this
you can stop storing the land man hashes

172
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,550
but it wasn't that way by the fall we
all know that the false security is what

173
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:29,010
everyone uses so around after the
response we got from 1.0 we started to

174
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,939
say you know wasn't just a proof of
concept tool that were showing a look

175
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,480
Microsoft is broken you should tell
Microsoft to fix their stuff we started

176
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,130
seeing that you know ten testers were
using this and system administrators

177
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,100
were using this to say hey I want to
secure my system isn't just about

178
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,370
telling Microsoft I'm sure they told
Microsoft that they should fix their

179
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:58,760
stuff but since they didn't crack took
on a life as a tool to secure systems to

180
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:05,480
point out weak passwords and understand
what passengers strong and what

181
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,720
passwords were weak and we saw system
administrators start to

182
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,240
to force users to do password resets
when they used weak passwords and this

183
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,759
is before there was any security
password quality checking which was

184
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,250
later added but even then you want to
you know we all know that you can use

185
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,839
the rules that the password quality is
enforcing to narrow their key space so

186
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,439
we started down this path at this point
to saying hey maybe we should be

187
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:39,759
focusing on helping Penn testers and
system administrators it's not just a

188
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:48,189
proof of concept so it came out with 1.5
a few months later and this is where we

189
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:51,730
started to say hey this is starting to
become a script he told to be on his

190
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,360
right let's have some ease of use

191
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,220
let's not make them use PWD let's build
a PWD functionality in so we can then

192
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,020
you know have a menu item the password
from the local registry we also had done

193
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,319
research on the whole challenge response

194
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,760
network protocol and if you captured
that data with with a packet sniffer we

195
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,809
would then we can crack the land man
challenge response protocol so we added

196
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,270
that in and then we said he mistreated
by using it we heard people at the

197
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,980
government we're using this we should be
charging them for this right they they

198
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,309
should be paying for our research so
you're doing this on our own dime and so

199
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:35,309
we we we create a shareware license I
don't know how many people are old

200
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:40,010
enough to understand shareware but
shareware was sort of like asking for a

201
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,590
donation now it actually was in the
license it said like if you use this

202
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:50,610
after so many days you need to send send
send some money right so was it was now

203
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,270
people ask for donations shareware was
actually in the license but there was no

204
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,780
enforcement right so it it it didn't
really work we actually only got paid

205
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,399
for a handful of a handful of licenses
while we were shareware and the first

206
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,700
customer was jus government accounting
office so it's kind of fun to be like a

207
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,530
the government's using our our tool to
audit the rest of the federal government

208
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:20,000
so then we're both this year where thing
wasn't working so about you know well

209
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,100
over six months later we said all right
let's let's you know let's put in a

210
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,969
actually license licensing mechanism for
you need a key to run the software and

211
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,990
all of a sudden when we did that
hundreds of people started paying for it

212
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,460
and then thousands of people started
paying for it so having the enforcement

213
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,410
they're really turned it into a
commercial product we built in

214
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,590
built-in challenge challenges . sniffing
to make it even easier than that even

215
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:55,709
understand how to use a like you know he
capped or something like that to dump

216
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,850
the packets you just choose from the
menu starts sniffing the network and it

217
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:07,350
would it would do that and then we we
created the Samsung functionality which

218
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,780
allowed you to get the hashes through
the same file which you could get from

219
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,700
emergency repair disk if you can
remember that back in the day or you can

220
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:24,700
boot you can boot and tea with Linux and
just grab the same file that way so

221
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,880
we're going to happen just making this
the turnkey easy easy thing to do dil

222
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,140
dog who now is really the main author of
life crack joined in ninety nine

223
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,520
full-time so now lost track is actually
sort of bootstrapping here he's the

224
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:51,460
license fees are actually enough to pay
him his his salary and he wrote the DSP

225
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,300
core algorithm did some really cool
stuff making sure that the inner loop of

226
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,970
the brute forcing was also in the L one
cache of the of the pentium chip at the

227
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,840
time and it was it was it was pretty so
it was pretty fast but the time when we

228
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,990
started adding another other techniques
that we had seen people talking about we

229
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,960
call that hybrid where you know you take
you take your word list and then you per

230
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,970
mute you know characters taking things
on the N

231
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,450
free pending a pending to follow the
patterns that that people used for

232
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:35,460
treating creating passwords and then
something happened which would you know

233
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,680
kind of put a lot of track down a
different path while track actually over

234
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,720
the eighteen years has been owned by
five different organizations so you

235
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,960
probably didn't know that so locked we
we had grown to about nine people we

236
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,190
start calling ourselves lot heavy
industries we have been doing a lot of

237
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:04,280
security research and in 2000 we are
trying to figure out how do we how do we

238
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,730
turn this into a full-time job for
anybody everybody do we need funding to

239
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,050
do that you know we lost track isn't
quite enough money to to bootstrap us to

240
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,530
try to figure that out and we ended up
making the decision to basically get

241
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:24,260
bought by this company called out steak
which was a VC backed fledgling security

242
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,240
consulting company in in the loft was
going to be there

243
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,750
reach them either research lab building
tools doing the research and then the

244
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,000
consultants will go out in the field and
in do that at stake wasn't interested in

245
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,420
any of our tools or technology they
actually were scared that we had a

246
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,590
password cracker they like no we don't
want to buy that so basically it was a

247
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,240
boat hire and they bought the brand name
they bought lost so they could say hey

248
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,020
we brought we bought the loft and by
doing that they made it to that we

249
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,260
couldn't have I lost website anymore and
I don't think we thought about it at the

250
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,840
time but we couldn't sell something
called Ophcrack anymore because they had

251
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,679
bought our brand so in hindsight I don't
know if that was the best deal but it

252
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,120
seems good at the time it was the frothy
dot com dot com right before the crash

253
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,820
right and so we had his version of
off-track ready to go we're calling it

254
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,300
lost track three you I was super simple

255
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,870
there was like a wizard where you can
just click click click you know Tom

256
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:37,729
crash report you could you could you
could just super easy to use and we

257
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,290
added remote registry importing so you
could you had authentication credentials

258
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:47,750
to a domain controller or another
machine you can actually it would send

259
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,030
over an agent dump the hatches and pull
them back over the network so super easy

260
00:22:53,030 --> 00:23:00,330
to on any machine was network reachable
that you had you had credentials for but

261
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:08,060
we we weren't able to release it because
it had the lost the law the last name so

262
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:13,810
we we got distracted starting at at at
at at stake for a while it took us

263
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:20,230
another almost a year here we basically
created another entity called security

264
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,820
software technologies and we renamed it
I'll see three so I don't have seen it

265
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,590
named Elsie 345 but we we we had to
change the name to get rid of the LCD

266
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,800
and that's that's where that came from

267
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,450
we also a distributed cracking at the
time she could run across multiple

268
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:49,100
multiple hosts and it would coordinate
coordinate splitting up the key space

269
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:58,730
and I cracking over over multiple
multiple machines and then went after he

270
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,550
renamed it I'll see three and sales were
bigger than ever almost certain that

271
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:08,040
steak start to get interested in it we
had I guess we had sanitize the word

272
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,540
locked and we had sanitized word crashed
and now is else III was this password

273
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,850
auditing and recovery tool in at stake
approached us and said would you we we

274
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:26,020
we we want to buy that buy and
distribute that that tool from you and I

275
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,060
think it was a lot of the ad States
corporate customers were being used at

276
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,790
the los guys there can I buy

277
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:36,800
can i buy off track from you so this was
sort of mistake number two I ended up

278
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,450
selling it to add stakes and now this is
the third entity that owns it but

279
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:50,010
there's a happy ending a happy ending so
you know now it has now we actually at

280
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:55,190
states like ok we'll invest in some more
professional you know marketing and we

281
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,520
have a product manager so you get a
product manager of course you have three

282
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,020
different versions right professional
administrative and consultant and

283
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,790
professional I think allows you to crack
up to a thousand users admin was mostly

284
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,889
unlimited but we did what we support
over 10,000 and then cancel it was sort

285
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,750
of a traveling license or it wasn't it
wasn't no blocked and we started and we

286
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:25,170
actually had a professional support
person who answered the phone and then

287
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,010
we started adding more people we came up
with Elsie for Rob Shane

288
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,400
join the team and just general
improvements but you can see now that

289
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,640
we're starting to get sanitized here
account losing our our dark hacker cool

290
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,090
graphics and it just looks like another
corporate tool and around this time if I

291
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,929
had to be on honest we're sort of losing
our edge here right we're not on the

292
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:56,510
forefront of coming up with new features
that no other cracking tools have it's

293
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:05,129
it's it's sort of sort of lagging and
this is sort of a lesson that you know

294
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,500
the the underground edge can be you can
be lost over time and i think i I think

295
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,169
that's starting to happen around around
this time

296
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:16,239
and other tools like John the Ripper
we're supporting and T

297
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:25,539
password hashes and you know you had
innovations like you know rainbow tables

298
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:31,289
getting implemented and we're starting
to fall behind here but of course this

299
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:35,590
is an at stake products time I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna come clean and I'm

300
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,918
in control here and then to the NLC five
comes out and this was the last version

301
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,879
that at stake

302
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:52,340
came out with did did implement rainbow
tables packet sniffers now updated and

303
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,029
add remediation options so you can track
your passwords are things that crack

304
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:00,399
really trivially white with a dictionary
attack you can select them all you can

305
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:07,090
hit a button it will go out and do
password resets on on on those accounts

306
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,189
you can see it sort of become an
enterprise tool as opposed to just a pen

307
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,789
tester tool and there's something again
interesting happens at stake it's pop by

308
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:22,639
Symantec and the Symantec by and i'm
looking at at stake at the time but I'm

309
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:30,149
not doing well see all 65 and semantic
buy the whole company so they get

310
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:39,389
everything they get the loft brand name
they get healthy five and after about

311
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:45,769
nine months I leave work at Symantec
wasn't very interesting they didn't want

312
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:53,649
to do any of the ideas that I wanted to
do and this really almost doomed a lot

313
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:56,939
of practice transaction I i cant believe
that children rose from the dead from

314
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:05,839
this but first interesting thing
happened shortly after semantic by at

315
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,359
stake and some semantic kept selling and
supporting I'll see five until I could

316
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,570
figure out that they didn't want to do
that anymore

317
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:20,359
companies kind of works very slowly
McAfee started flagging Elsie 5 as a

318
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,978
malicious tool I was like this is just
bizarre like we've been around all these

319
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:28,709
years and all of a sudden seven years
later

320
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:33,659
mcAfee is flagging this as a malicious
tool and to all our customers are

321
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,739
complaining that they have to wait list
it and they can't downloaded they can

322
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:43,499
install it was really bizarre that when
symantec owned it if you can so I don't

323
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:48,099
know if there's a conspiracy theory
there between McAfee and Symantec but I

324
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,718
did get that cleaned up I did I did talk
to people at McAfee and I said hey this

325
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:58,799
is a legitimate password auditing and
recovery tool it's being sold by one of

326
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,979
your main competitors semantic you can't
blacklist this and they undid the

327
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:06,629
blacklist I think we're like on some
white list now because I've never had

328
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:11,928
the problem again so that may be that
that ended up turning up turning up for

329
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,669
the for the best so then this is the
dark days of life track and this is

330
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:20,690
probably way or else he 5 it probably
went into obscurity for most people if

331
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:26,440
they were even caring about it and
semantic ended up end of life in the

332
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,389
product to like you know we don't agree
with sort of offensive tools or tools

333
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:35,449
that actually break things in order to
secure them that's not the semantic

334
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:45,039
ethos right so they they they end of
life after a couple of years and so it

335
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,150
just sort of sitting there

336
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:51,480
R and they own the technology and no one
is doing anything with it so we decided

337
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,950
hey what if you know much told on myself
so what if we go to Simeon taken say you

338
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,380
can we buy life back from you you know
we don't we we we think that we could we

339
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,410
could continue development thing it and
you know they they thought about it and

340
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,100
they thought that you know it would be
good if we bought it because we can sort

341
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,169
of take the liability of all the
customers that might complain to them

342
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:20,360
that you know you know they they still
want support and it would just be a

343
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,560
clean way for them to just completely
get rid of it so we ended up buying it

344
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:31,080
from them so now it's come back to LA
sort of went into the corporate world

345
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,699
and then popped back out again till
December 31st 2008 lot track is back

346
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:47,420
owned by meet again in March and so we
went to work and i three months we can

347
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,660
all laugh track sex so it's back off
track again right and then we have the

348
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:58,930
sharp edges again on the saw a dangerous
cool and you know it sort of got its

349
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:07,500
mojo back and so we we we we we've been
selling this now for five years and you

350
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,880
know the big thing to do is just bring
it up to date support 64 bit password

351
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:23,970
hash dumping and then we added UNIX UNIX
support so you know what do we do now

352
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,430
right and we have it back

353
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,940
people people people are buying it
people still want to purchase hack

354
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,940
password so you know I think the goal
still is let's put all the tools her

355
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,000
password auditing and one program right
let's let's be able to grab the hashes

356
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,680
all the different ways that you can do
it in one program whether it's sniffing

357
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:52,150
on the network or it's grabbing them
from registries and files have the

358
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,840
enterprise tools there

359
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,408
importantly support all the modern CPUs
and GPUs that are out there make it more

360
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:06,690
than just windows and one of the other
goals is for us to include more security

361
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,150
company so this community so that's
that's that's sort of what we're

362
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,460
thinking about now and how are thinking
about off-track there are some

363
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,809
challenges you know it's harder to
extract cash is remotely now there's a

364
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:26,190
lot of firewalls people were blocking
SNB on the network there's remote uac

365
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:33,890
it's it's it's more difficult to do
cleanly cleanly now this differs

366
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:38,840
woefully out of date doesn't work with
Windows 8 anymore and you know GPUs are

367
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,850
obviously very very important

368
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:48,189
22 password cracking and we want we want
to support them but one of things even

369
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,850
realizing in some cases you know you can
have a slow GPU and fast CPU and what do

370
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,668
you do in that situation you don't want
to just default to deep you so these are

371
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:01,070
some of the shows some of the goals and
these are some of the challenges been

372
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,830
working on this all comes down to

373
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,129
we're going to come out with off-track
seven so we think that there is plenty

374
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:15,440
of more life left in passwords yeah we
saw take Microsoft 10 years to change

375
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,809
their original scheme I think those
still gonna have until I'm passwords in

376
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:27,490
10 years I think it'll still be there so
while I think two-factor authentication

377
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:32,640
and things like that are great I don't I
don't expect the world to move that

378
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,220
quickly and so we're making we're making
a significant investment because we

379
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:45,299
think this is still a lot of of life in
in cracking password hashes so this is a

380
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,539
little preview of life track 7 wherein
beaten now if you're really interested

381
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:52,879
in trying it out

382
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,330
you can email us at support at La
cracked.com and so what we've done is

383
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,199
we've completely overhaul it we've got a
hundred percent new code base we got rid

384
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,800
of MSC which is very windows centric and
went to cutie so we can put this to you

385
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:16,550
Linux and we can ported to Mac OS pretty
easily and we made a decision that the

386
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,870
current cracking engines are so far
ahead of of what we're where we were out

387
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,259
with this you know four-year hiatus and
then even longer

388
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,340
that that wasn't where we were gonna get
our marquee value so we worked with

389
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,620
solar designer and open wall and we're
actually licensing the John the Ripper

390
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:46,620
engine from open wall and so we have a
license to sell that in in in LA crack

391
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:54,520
which is great because it gives us good
GPU support in actually really cool CPU

392
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,440
support for all the latest CPU
instruction sets the other thing that we

393
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,940
we've done which we think is probably
more in the Lok track sweet spot is you

394
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,540
know grabbing ramona grabbing password
hashes so we came up with a way of doing

395
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:15,930
that over RDP really clearly because if
you look at the way Windows networks are

396
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:23,270
administrated these days it's usually by
the Remote Desktop Protocol so people

397
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,990
use that port that ports open so the
firewall off everything else in the loud

398
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:34,910
ep through so it's great to be able to
grab password howitzers that way so we

399
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,210
get the John the Ripper complex world
was routine rules were having full

400
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:47,500
unicode support fully internationalize
really good scheduling so you can say is

401
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,840
scheduled script with the GUI that just
says hey go out and every month crashes

402
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,370
from these twenty different machines and
crack them this way and send me the

403
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,029
report reset

404
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,780
you know recently password so it's it's
fully fully schedule and and and

405
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,980
automate apple and we've added for UNIX
support so we kinda had some kind of

406
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,380
broken UNIX support before now fully
supported Linux Solaris PST and AIX

407
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:22,290
hashes you can grab them over SSH so if
you have you know if you if you have

408
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,430
your system setup that you can have the
permissions on an account to log in

409
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,690
remotely to get out at the shadow file
you can do that

410
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:40,010
remote remotely by just setting it up in
in the in in in the program at least we

411
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:47,550
said we restore the credentials and
Windows credential store one of the cool

412
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:53,320
features we've added is calibration and
calibration does is it looks through all

413
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:00,570
the different CPU and GPU options that
we can detect and all the difference

414
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:08,340
cash types that we have and it runs a
calibration to find the fastest way to

415
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,850
to to to crack that password and build I
got very excited and he added a little

416
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,360
flames if you get over one gig or cracks
per second I don't know that made it or

417
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,540
not cuz he just sent me the screenshot a
few days ago and I like I have to put

418
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,640
that in that so cool so maybe this
animated think it actually is but yeah

419
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,430
you can see here that you know you're
getting your getting its GPU supported

420
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,520
its the GPU is probably gonna be the
fastest I mean he's got a really fast

421
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,750
CPU there you can see from the from the
cracking speed but you could have a slow

422
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,800
ass low GPU and a fast CPU and then it
would pick the CPU and it just think we

423
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,620
enough you can see for some of the types
that are not supported with John the

424
00:37:50,620 --> 00:38:00,970
Ripper on the GPU that the XOP
extensions are the fastest summits the

425
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,790
SEC I don't know why the SEC to

426
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,640
is the fastest it must be some some
reason with the algorithm hasn't been

427
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:15,710
updated very well to see other
instructions but this is this is this is

428
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,840
a cool feature and it's going to be even
cooler because what we're gonna support

429
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:28,120
in this version is completely possible
API so you could actually plug in a

430
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:35,740
different cracking algorithm in with the
API and we would cycle through that and

431
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,620
see hey is this will look at all the all
the all the tracking algorithm that are

432
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,720
that are that have been installed for
this hash in choose the one that's the

433
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,839
fastest so that is that that that's one
of the goal to try to try to open up the

434
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,560
ecosystem a little bit more this really
cool stuff going on in the open source

435
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,960
community you know recently has cat has
been open source of someone could write

436
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,400
a plugin for using our API and and use
hashtag it would check John the Ripper

437
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,300
vs has cat and we just it was just
select the fastest the fastest algorithm

438
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:16,240
so trying out trying trying to make a
little bit of an ecosystem here so

439
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,770
future directions we definitely want to
do

440
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:26,290
MacOSX court you know I have i think a
lot of people you know

441
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,529
use that as a as a laptop and if they're
only doing you know dictionary hacking

442
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,210
or something like that or you know I'd
like to see how the GPUs are on on on

443
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:42,520
OSX so we want to try that and we want
to we want to do with our plugins we

444
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,890
want to be able to extract hashes from a
lot of different places

445
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:51,359
crack lots of different password types
you know we're pretty much a small

446
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,690
outfit were only three people so we
can't cover the whole universe so we

447
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,120
think what the plug-in modules that
people could you give them away they

448
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,319
could sell them we we don't care we want
to try to open up

449
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:12,830
open that up a bit so I think I'll this
ended there and save some time

450
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,960
save some time for questions

451
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,310
anyone
