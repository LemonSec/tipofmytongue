1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,240
thank you guys

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,579
my number of countries he cannot as and
today I want to speak with you about the

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:20,789
articles of information leaked research
I'm working in the field over

4
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,580
implementing an improvement that I just
heard management process asylum was

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:33,650
destroyed in documents and I have
experience in social security but on the

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,310
other side I have a typological
education and consulting psychologist

7
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:46,660
and working with people and why I
decided to make this talk the idea was

8
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,440
born after the situation of Ashley
Madison dating sites all of you know

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:58,839
about this site these breaches wasn't
the biggest one and then maybe not so

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,729
interesting but a lot of people was
affected by its not only the persons who

11
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,900
I was really registered on the site but
their families and the people who don't

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,010
even just because registration don't
need approving by email so anyone can

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:28,650
just get some information from you and
on this site and medicine member

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,580
you know a lot of scandals divorces and
all such stuff was around this breach

15
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:44,429
and you don't see already have some
people was so affected by this situation

16
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,330
what they decide to commit suicide after
8 and up to help psychologist I know

17
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,860
what the basis of most people is being
safe you all of us you really want to be

18
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,530
safe and if we lose this safety we can
do a lot of things like this even like

19
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,410
this and that's why I want to speak
about the previous see the ethics and

20
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,520
such things with you as a people who
used his britches information from these

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:28,470
bridges is research materials one of the
consequences of the information

22
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,609
revolution can be considered the
possibility of losing our individual

23
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,690
privacy right and they're all this right

24
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,500
our existence in our dignity as human
individuals may be in prayer after all

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,060
the ability to control the information
about themselves the moral basis of the

26
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,580
right to free speech and he would have
very important then diagram about

27
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,030
privacy on the Internet

28
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:07,180
or a lot of information stored in the
data banks and in the internet so you

29
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,480
can get some data to some sites for one
purpose and anybody can use it for other

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,299
purposes

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,760
done just about any notification to you
so there is no privacy on the internet

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,079
but you know these I know this but a lot
of people think what we can go to the

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,870
internet gets on some information on the
side like it reminds them for example

34
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:40,250
and it will be safe in a good hence they
don't know anything about this but after

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,220
some evil persons get this information
from internet etc you can go to the

36
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,980
internet and download it and use it as a
material for your citrus and make some

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,299
interesting conclusions what help you to
improve some information security etc

38
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:05,530
but in the end of a feeds just
information about the human life's

39
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,370
some words about the big don't help the
situation then I begin with my

40
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:18,590
relationship with internet access speed
was only 56 kilobits per second maybe no

41
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:27,380
not know everybody off you remember this
time and I paid 20 bucks for the mom of

42
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,770
the internet and this was only $50 for
the internet and now I played 10 bucks

43
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,359
and I have this period

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,950
500 megabits megabits per second so i
can download and upload a lot of

45
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,900
information and now we have a lot of
things like Florence and equip and we

46
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,008
have a lot of space where we can store
and share

47
00:04:55,009 --> 00:05:03,930
a lot of information so it's the
information about the leaks for the bus

48
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:13,869
ten years from 2004 to deposit them and
you can see every Bible on the screen is

49
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:22,139
a leak and the size of the leak is not a
lot of leaks here and not big news

50
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:32,339
agency so we can see the next load and
they told us what beloved by viewers and

51
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,979
we have a lot of reaches a lot of leaks
and a lot of really sensitive

52
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:44,830
information not only the number of leaks
increased by the sensitivity of the

53
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:54,558
adult let's see so in 2004 it will reach
a lot of account was stolen but only

54
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:02,839
email addresses and passwords and
weakened in recent times

55
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,689
records with personal details about the
sexuality about your preferences genders

56
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:22,019
home addresses and names and a lot of
stuff but we need to get this

57
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:39,990
information but if you remember what is
now we have Torrance and as you can see

58
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,550
you guys have fun for me and you can
just go into all that

59
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,650
and if previously you need to get these
discs and meet some guys who you just

60
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,150
get give this to them or maybe hard
right now just go to the internet and

61
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:10,229
everything you can find their you could
get information about the user names and

62
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:17,330
passwords ten years ago and now you can
get everything including a justice even

63
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,940
the private messages from the site

64
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,840
everything and if you can't just on CDs
and hard drives just press the button

65
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:35,599
and everything will be uploaded by
Torrance but we have and what about the

66
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,330
law

67
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:43,640
this situation we have article 8 of the
European Convention of Human Rights will

68
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,860
protect the right to respect the private
life everyone has the right to respect

69
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,850
for his private and family life his home
and he is correspondence and we have

70
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,960
article of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights of united

71
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:14,120
nation what else will protect privacy
and data protection laws protect private

72
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:28,690
life but it's bright light of the
situation we have a dark side to

73
00:08:28,690 --> 00:09:09,770
everything there was to get this
information but under threat

74
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:15,490
privacy so you can tell me if I'm russia
and that's why I am talking about the

75
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,670
essay because of the americans of all I
have a slight especially for this

76
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:29,370
I can say the same as about the NSA
about any a lot of agencies around the

77
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:39,630
world all I think I don't have any real
news about it but I I hope they are

78
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,570
collecting stuff with all the citizens
all around the world about their own

79
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:56,260
citizens about people from around the
world and we have some question what

80
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,280
happens if the leak occurred in one
country downloaded by a citizen of

81
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,079
another country and when he helped
lewinsky informational service like

82
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,470
identified country what law we need to
use in such a situation for example if

83
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:21,320
it's Europe America and China and a lot
of interesting questions i have the last

84
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:30,200
stronghold of it in the formation about
the private life was the research and

85
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm really when I start thinking about
this talk I i'm through I was trying to

86
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,760
see what the University of Reading all
go to protect and respect to the private

87
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,970
life of citizens and they know how to
handle with care but the latest Oriya

88
00:10:49,970 --> 00:11:08,050
question do you know what what in
January 2000 and 4000 network have

89
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:16,370
joined the door network and in the June
to research it served it's a part of

90
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:23,810
software Institute in Carnegie Mellon
University we have these talk black hat

91
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,010
conference you don't have to be

92
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,920
anything to break tour then analyzing
user on the budget and we're talking

93
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:47,579
about the day on my story was just for
three hundred thousand bucks adult and

94
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,390
after all these things in July the Tor
project ejects this attack and release

95
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:06,490
but certain researchers attacking them
and in the end of the story

96
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,710
the information from the target internal
network led to the identification of

97
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:19,750
criminal suspects in the dark with the
staff member of drug market place and

98
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:28,290
then man charged with possession of
child pornography and we can feed yes we

99
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:36,219
can rejoice the trial for justice one
small detail we don't know how many

100
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,130
people was under surveillance

101
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,380
all this time it's more than happy here
and I really think not all of them

102
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,050
criminals but every I collecting
information about them using this stuff

103
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:58,219
we don't know really what university
helped the FBI because of the Carnegie

104
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:06,380
Mellon gone deny or accept any
speculation we do see yet they don't say

105
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,800
no but in the end it's not at all
important which one

106
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,680
University helping FBI but more
important think what their academic

107
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,120
researchers can do such things they can
use their knowledge to disrespect their

108
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,750
private life of people and I think it's
really it's time to

109
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:45,520
talk about what we have threats all
around us is not so helpful University

110
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,020
not always on the side of privacy
protection and information from leaks

111
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,660
can be really helpful for you you can
use it and research something so we

112
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:07,209
really need to speak about the ethics
like this it's great it's a branch of

113
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,790
philosophy at investigate the question
sides what's good and what's bad

114
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:18,060
information security researchers Oh fun
don't have any restrictions or the use

115
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,770
of data what they have obtained and even
if these data is not used to enable evil

116
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,800
under force being used information but
nobody except to you you always have

117
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,839
information but nobody comment oh yes
you can boot just will not ask about

118
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,910
this weekend we have 14 count on Russia
medicine how many people were asked to

119
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:56,329
do kennedy and use your information for
our soldiers this is this is it in the

120
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:02,600
light hits and he asked you this
question is it ethical at all to use the

121
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:12,320
information obtained as a result of
leaks I know what everybody of you have

122
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,730
the auditors had to end this caller may
be a white maybe Blake may be great but

123
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,660
for me it's really important that every
time when you use the information from

124
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:32,780
what the color of your head now is it
maybe there's no greater than it was I

125
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,199
don't tell me it's

126
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,760
not ethical to use this kind of
information it's my opinion and I really

127
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:55,689
want to hear your opinions and
everything you do is click in them and

128
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:04,860
the and the top but some details but we
need to think about for example one of

129
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,320
them is password themself can be the
private and sensual formation for

130
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,520
example if I am working in there my name
is like some shit you can go up and my

131
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,079
surname isn't well spread even in russia
and they're all the world history rare

132
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,150
and what if I have a password

133
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:32,720
somebody some expert like you just get
somebody to get some patches and crack

134
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,400
women just realize how many employees
have a weak passwords and among them was

135
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,069
my one and it was something like this
you can call me a tease for example and

136
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,730
that's why you have private really
sensitive information about me not even

137
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:59,340
know my account or username or something
it just took my password and it was like

138
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:10,620
this and one more interesting question
is people who use a layer password so

139
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,020
then you have a leak and you get some
sense into him and you know about sports

140
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:24,220
and you know the person which both of us
what does it belong to so you know we

141
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,120
have with so many places where we can
lose our privacy on the internet if we

142
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:37,030
use old password so you crack some but
not only this site is under is in danger

143
