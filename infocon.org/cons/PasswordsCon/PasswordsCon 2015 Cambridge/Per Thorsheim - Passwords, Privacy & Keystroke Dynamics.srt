1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:10,260
so I'm gonna change orders to next
speaker which is maybe it's a good thing

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,160
I'm being the conference organizer you
have an army of his sudden rise and you

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,500
know can make small changes to your
program and unfortunately a good friend

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,700
of mine polo he couldn't make it but I'm
going to do on various and while I'm

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,759
gone I'm gonna try to be quick on this
one and talk about keystroke dynamics

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:38,579
and the basics are very simple choice
when it comes to biometrics you can put

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,149
it into two categories physiological we
just you know how your face looks like

8
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,969
fingerprint on our region D&I behavioral
biometrics which is small like you know

9
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:54,079
how you type on a keyboard how you do
your signature how you do your voice you

10
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,420
know you can sync to computer to log on
as an example now this is a little bit

11
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,879
of both team behavioral biometrics there
are some cool stuff that you can do when

12
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,409
it comes to you know tracking people an
example that have been done the research

13
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,380
into looking at prom adults and we'll
see you on the Summerside to see what is

14
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,640
the current battery staged a dose off
the client visiting you and all of your

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,510
battery status on your phone or your
laptop iPod is not the same as the one

16
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,619
sitting next to you so based on that
action opportunity to distinguish

17
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:38,890
different people from each other which
is kinda cool it's also kind of scary

18
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,330
now fallen behind on my metrics you know
there are some good things you can do

19
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,570
with that you can use a missile
two-factor authentication most banks in

20
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,189
Norway and also some banks charity UK
already you sing keystroke done that

21
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:03,298
makes to look at how do you type your
password when you log on and they used

22
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,519
as a fraud detection my connection now I
discovered this back you know during the

23
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:15,079
summer in Norway data banks by using
dots they have told nobody they

24
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,250
implement a dismal

25
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,830
more than a year ago but it didn't
change that and you slightly less a

26
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,400
green pen today didn't change anything
didn't announce anything at all they

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,190
thought they had it covered and suddenly
like by implementing this in just a

28
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,890
couple of days pretty much like a week
they have a biometric keystroke dynamics

29
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:44,320
profile of 3.5 million norwegians
approximately and it's also interesting

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,940
because this doesn't he know compared to
like using Turkish number also this

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,780
action identifies you as a human being
and not to browse all your computer by

32
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,860
itself so the animals you to do lots of
well again cool stuff you can use it

33
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,209
without requiring a login you can do
keystroke like you know how you type on

34
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,020
your keyboard you can also look at most
movements you can also look look at you

35
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,750
know how you touch screen as far as I
know in this area and this is not my

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,430
specialty but I've been told that task
as soon as you have done three maybe

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,500
four swipes across your phone like
looking at the picture gallery those

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,330
three or four strokes across the street
is sufficient to identify you from most

39
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:39,170
other people believe it or not can also
new enrollment of this because no look

40
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,630
at your keystroke dynamics ostensible do
require you to do a little bit off you

41
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,269
know typing so you can decide about sign
up you have to tell enter your password

42
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,019
like 10 times so we can build this
profile of you all they can just use 10

43
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,320
loggins into the future to build a
profile of you assuming not it's the

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,220
same person of the logging in each and
every time which is hopefully for your

45
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,230
bank account it will be the same person
looking logging in every time but there

46
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,018
are also some downsides to this I'm not
spacek the last column here they can

47
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:20,790
identify You instead of your computer
suddenly if you are using your market

48
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,080
the moment and they have a profile of
you and then you move on to another

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,740
computer and start typing in there
instead you don't have the same

50
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,870
the same tracking cookie on both
computers but it is the same human being

51
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,990
typing on both computers and suddenly
they could be able to see that while

52
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,949
it's you and nobody else does login
right now and the keystroke dynamics are

53
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,050
based on several prominent also
explained that something as simple as

54
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,550
for how long will you actually keep our
key processed and what is the flight

55
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,800
time between two or small sequence of of
keys on your keyboard arsenic sample

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,569
what you can do is you can go online I
had professor just a horse and dog of

57
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:13,889
presenting at Posterous com in 2012 and
house this software that you can see a

58
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,360
screenshot off on this address it's
available for free for Windows and

59
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,259
basically he collects in between two key
precious time between 11 and one

60
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,659
pressure one pressure on released pilot
went to kiss release and don't stop

61
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:36,639
parameters you can play around with it
I'm sad cos reais my password you just

62
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,610
type it in a you will immediately see
the results so this is me talking

63
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:49,460
password this one spike is a very small
like 10 20:30 millisecond delay on one

64
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,370
of those keys I can see a meal how it
differentiates how the software my local

65
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,409
people or try afterwards you can do that
I can type in password

66
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:02,979
we can see if any one of you are able to
type in password just the same way as I

67
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,900
do an example now when I came across
this I'm thinking because I like to

68
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,539
break stuff so I can break this
eventually I can I break the fact that

69
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,900
this can be used against me to truck I
do appreciate the anti fraud detection

70
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,460
systems that are being used with my bank
but I'm not quite sure if I like this

71
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,539
for us next sample advertising trucking
an example so one of the examples of

72
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,190
Diane called talked about it as well

73
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,669
people using tall people are using the
toilet brush off to stay anonymous on

74
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,210
the Internet

75
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:46,000
and behavior psyche which is one of the
companies and do this kind of software

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,870
we're using the specifically to try to
break the solution and basically we said

77
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,169
well behavior SEC requires JavaScript to
be run so if you do allow JavaScript in

78
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,380
your toe broke so they can build a
profile of you and they will be able to

79
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,590
recognize you on another computer
running towards us an example as long as

80
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,609
you allow JavaScript now if you're a bad
job and you don't want anyone to be able

81
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:23,449
to recognize you track you using talk
suddenly this can be a potential way of

82
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:29,099
being able to identify people and
another case if you're doing around six

83
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,940
if you're working for the police for any
kind of government institution whatever

84
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,900
yes you're doing research online on the
dock web and you don't want to be

85
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,349
trucked either then this can also be a
potential problem but behavior SEC uses

86
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:53,490
Javascript so you should disable not too
pretty well off the advertising example

87
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,699
a something else simple us you go online
to electronic store you're looking for

88
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,750
new vacuum cleaner yet another been to
this site before you have no cookies

89
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:10,719
from them nothing if you just type in
vacuum cleaner in the search field of

90
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:16,229
this online shop you have to know as
soon as you type 7 to 8 characters on

91
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,430
your keyboard there are already enough
information to tell whether you are male

92
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,370
or female so you type in vacuum cleaner
and they know well it's a man looking

93
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,669
for vacuum cleaner so you will get the
blue one black woman talk only if your

94
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,069
email will be sent with all the colors

95
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:49,430
available on the site and as well as my
lesson has come a fascinating so

96
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,900
basically what I did I i've talked to
think about this since like 2012 him for

97
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,730
that and my father is well I have to
even out all those key process so you

98
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:10,250
know I'd looked like just like anybody
else i was thinkin tour style but then

99
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,720
I'd well I had some talks with with Paul
in the late evening on Sky one of the

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,980
things that we do I told them of the
budget idea I said well we couldn't you

101
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,310
know even out only keystrokes all the
keystrokes looks the same or we could

102
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,670
eventually also may be due randomness
but my idea was to know let's just about

103
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,979
every check and Paul so well what if all
the key strokes are coming in

104
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,270
evenly you know that's a sign that
someone is doing something you know hope

105
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,910
you know weird and that again makes them
stand out from the crowd so he said lets

106
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,620
out randomness and that we hope that we
have this company behavior second doing

107
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,630
this stuff online to have a demo so we
could try to offer free and the first

108
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,189
initial proof of concept plugin for
Google Chrome that Paul created in like

109
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:13,930
minutes was one line of JavaScript code
adding randomness to every keystroke

110
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,930
going from the keyboard into the
Dhammapada broza and some deleted by the

111
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:27,180
detection rate the behavioral psych went
from 99% just 0.01% no one wanna live in

112
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,069
Provo concept JavaScript code so I said
well you can go to sleep now pull I want

113
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,950
to chrome plugin jared is it's called
keep your privacy is a number from

114
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,270
Google Chrome it's for free and don't
call it under some but if you want to

115
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,600
disallow it four separate so is this
like you know I do for my online bank I

116
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,380
actually want them to be able to do this
striking so nobody else would be able to

117
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,560
log into my bank

118
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,890
counts as an example for all sides by
default this is running so essentially

119
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,470
the default settings will each another
key press you do that it will instruct

120
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,620
our randomness of 0 to 50 milliseconds
and that's more than sufficient to

121
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:17,540
completely break all the truck and
eventually doing to you and trust me

122
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,849
myself and Paul we were having lots of
fun

123
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,670
dose late evenings back in and of July
like picking out like okay so the

124
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,160
biometrics guys have been working on
this for like 10 15 years at least I'm

125
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,650
here we are like two guys later in the
evening on Skype and pulled us to one

126
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,819
line and JavaScript code and we had
completely broken 15 years researching

127
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:50,339
sorry guys and today because we promised
people that we would do a firefox plugin

128
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,310
dog proved more difficult than we
thought we also for that will you know

129
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:02,170
we went into full paranoid more remote
so we thought well you're operating

130
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,349
system could be compromise that could be
doing this kind of tracking from the

131
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,270
operating system so paul was actually
going to be heard today

132
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:19,500
2% our small very small USB Houma dongle
that goes between your keyboard I know

133
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:28,600
computer W this for you and Paul called
me on Monday saying not sure we have a

134
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,050
problem because this small dog it works
but it only works with the UK keyboard

135
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,030
layout

136
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,310
there some USB stuff that we need to
figure out so so I'm gonna have to say

137
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,650
like we were hoping this would be the
greatest Christmas present for you as

138
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:55,970
long as you can purchase from me chudai
but while we have two devices we are

139
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:02,830
going to take creole also very soon for
lots of family saw anyone else who
