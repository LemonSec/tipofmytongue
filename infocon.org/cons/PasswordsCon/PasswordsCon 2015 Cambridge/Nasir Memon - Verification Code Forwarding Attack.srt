1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:23,550
thank you but let's see how it does so
actually I'm not sure women from NYU the

2
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,089
work was mostly they're in my my
students Hussein and unfortunately they

3
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:35,420
couldn't make it and I had the pleasure
to visit Cambridge instead of them so I

4
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:42,960
guess the penny stock was fun discussion
at least was a good segue into what I'll

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,219
talk about now is that we all know and
the scene many large service providers

6
00:00:50,219 --> 00:01:01,199
use SMS as sort of a second channel a
second factor to strengthen security or

7
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,600
didn't circumstances for example
password recovery rates are you forgot

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,559
your password and email for example we
have a phone model for registered it

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,829
would send you a verification code to
that today by phone but you weren't

10
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:28,298
there by you can reset your password is
also you sometimes and out so that's one

11
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,350
kind of situation where it's used for
those who shared second the shared

12
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,280
secret is lost and are using a second
challenge somehow through recover that

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,509
check with him in many ways of doing it
myself as one another

14
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,909
another situation where this can be done
at times is where you're not certain

15
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:55,710
about the authentication process because
maybe say the IP address has changed so

16
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,259
did a person is now indicating from
Timbuktu where

17
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:07,450
done that before so you see it give me
more give me more so certain systems

18
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,090
could then be ok I'll send you an SMS on
your phone and verification code

19
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,970
provided so game to a different channel
so as you mean that the attacker 27

20
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,230
winners will have to compromise border
check out and then sometimes spoke on

21
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,220
creation was well I remember being in
one country and forget which one where

22
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:37,530
they tend to be watched the people more
closely I guess and I was ordered to the

23
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,190
airport has free WiFi in my 22 ok and
connected it also a phone number I gave

24
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,190
it and then it send me a verification
code to the phone number which I had to

25
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,200
enter so now they might buy me my
identity to this phone number so later

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,230
on in this some reason they need to come
after me at least in my phone number so

27
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,619
to the various situations in which the
second channel their second factor

28
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,120
whatever you call it is used and
basically doesn't mention is that

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,320
brought the channels need to be
compromised and hence its bigger hurdle

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,780
for an attacker and this is where you're
right to do so is being analyzed for

31
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,660
more than a decade now I think I roughly
a decade and people of looked at it and

32
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,829
and even talked about how this could be
circumvented if you have my word that is

33
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,290
why you see me do independent depending
on how things went down to a

34
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,160
man-in-the-middle attack it's a separate
search going to start a single bullet

35
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,250
but it sort of being used by very large
service providers it went today

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,580
announced that is has some where you
live and provide some additional

37
00:03:46,580 --> 00:04:03,290
measures of security for purposes of
medication so I don't have to be few

38
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,459
have malware on the only uses one mile
if you are able to undermine the middle

39
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:18,280
in certain situations then you can
perhaps this but what if you simply ask

40
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,619
the user will likely be used to be kind
enough just give it to you

41
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:33,120
it turns out it appears to be yes that's
why it was a short paper we have sort of

42
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,960
a pilot study that we did

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,450
news you go to Gmail you go to divert
the username and password

44
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:52,409
zooming in order for number of discourse
what happens then is this person because

45
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,200
they asked what he say they will all of
them do some because they didn't ask for

46
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,229
he said because I recently last quarter
of America account suddenly on the blue

47
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,780
they will get an SMS why certain you're
ready for gatien code is something

48
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:12,429
something something right and who knows
what they do not know but please do not

49
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:20,440
do that because we know that they've
just because we said we should limit my

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,230
search engine this is just an example in
some way short of coaxing them asking

51
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,570
them to to send that quote to us so
please verify that your phone is

52
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,719
associated with silicone by replying

53
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,850
with the code that just very just sent
to you and will they travel in and send

54
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:46,080
it to us if they do then I taken I have
access to that email account so that was

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:57,530
our hypothetical scenario we want check
of this kind of works out so we kind of

56
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:05,549
small pilot study and that's why I say
it appears that people will fall for it

57
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,170
because to proof of concept does this
work

58
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,380
anything virtually 500 people roughly
how many rows will give me the code

59
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,850
obviously not all of them would i think
im I would not I don't know dependable

60
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,950
ago the connection how much I drank that
night or whatever you never know what

61
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:36,490
you do but in in in things like fishing
for example there are studies done in

62
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:43,310
companies regularly face their employees
and and it's known that a 15 percent

63
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:50,419
response rate is apparently pretty
decent CIO feels that ok only 15% reply

64
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:55,840
responded you doing a reasonable job and
have somebody like company CIOs have

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,440
told me that they are somewhere between
20 and 25 when they working on it so so

66
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,460
I'm fishing was later would be be
students we would fully fall in the same

67
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,010
kind of range I don't want to get an
understanding of the day forward Ryan

68
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,840
they doing this what is going on in that
mind so we didn't fall into a small

69
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,380
study we basically did this a suicide
attack between users and we made sure

70
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,580
that these users all had the two-factor
authentication turned on Gmail to do

71
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,690
with family over the state that it was
not something strength to make it for a

72
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:42,729
bit and then we called 10 of them
personally because this was done within

73
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,248
the school itself these

74
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:49,269
people we kind of knew because we had to
move the formal wear and then we call

75
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,479
them personally and sat down with them
and chatted with a little bit to figure

76
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,149
out what was it how did they do to
protect holding what was going on in

77
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:03,979
that mind and then we need his lady love
this study may be simulated this

78
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:10,019
mechanical 200 user I think that kind of
role playing scenario kind of thing what

79
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:21,349
would you do if you got this message
kind of 52 essentially we got two

80
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:27,209
numbers numbers i think is 650 I mean
that again probably wasn't important to

81
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,819
know step most people probably don't
know that I don't remember 65 you start

82
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:37,409
with that and send these two messages
right in the new study seconds to first

83
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,019
base was recently users your booming but
if you can call it is and send them to

84
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:46,800
us 69 the number and then within 30
seconds he said please verify your phone

85
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,250
still associated with your Gmail account
but applying this basis but of course we

86
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:59,660
have just sent you and what happening we
hold about 50 the trend is pointed back

87
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:07,439
with a small size so don't take these
percentages to mean much at this point

88
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:12,569
but the fact that this fall in the same
Rangers preaching sort of experiments

89
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:18,920
tend to give us some sort of give some
credence to the sort of thing that you

90
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,560
have about 25 percent of the people did
respond back and gave us a cold

91
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:37,270
we call them and we sort of had a short
interview again this was a small study

92
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:45,900
we just exploring what's going on out
here before we did already a larger more

93
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,459
principled study

94
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,510
reasons for enabling the two FAA that
they have two or three why do you do it

95
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,089
and they basically most of the time the
darkest saying that they do it because

96
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:02,960
they tend to lead the gmail from
untrusted computers from knives or

97
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,580
computers that they don't own themselves
we just kind of a bit strange because

98
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,100
when you're doing that and my way and
stuff is on the other side of problems

99
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,920
that there that they have to deal with
it too it may not help them and then he

100
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,339
also asked them if they notice these
phone numbers when they get like what

101
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,980
phone number does it come from and
whether they have in their mind some

102
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,410
sense will reduce the right number of
this is a strange number of something on

103
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:41,199
that so what did you think of the
message to think it was it from Google

104
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,720
dad did not ask for ratification called
you just got my mom wanted and why in a

105
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,270
forward it right and whether they
weren't mentally talk that such an

106
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,380
attack was possible that whether they're
the kind of pizza such a scenario of

107
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:05,370
somebody taking it and we're entering a
month so the paper or losses similar to

108
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,230
shuttle bus was but I have a longer
version as well give more details about

109
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,649
what what

110
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:21,100
the subject of said but of course we
expected some of them like several of

111
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,160
them didn't even look at the numbers
there was some who saw that the code the

112
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,160
code came from one number in the quest
for the code came from another number so

113
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,170
they were suspicious of these numbers
can be spoofed but again be special

114
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,709
numbers that you can assume this is on
the same digit numbers for high school

115
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,118
for something of that sort

116
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:50,309
I don't know how easily those can be
scooped and then they just because it

117
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,860
was Google asking and because of a
fearful of losing their email because

118
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,230
email is something they want in this
listing is saying hey we need to know

119
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,869
they could to continue email or
something of that kind they just

120
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:09,189
forwarded that was kinda mean thinking
that we can come to a man who talking to

121
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:13,089
people who are actually forwarded did
they had this trio of losing their gmail

122
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:23,249
account which they didn't want to win
and so did the largest study 100 sort of

123
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:26,800
lame duck people in again I said this
was more the floor playing scenario

124
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,469
didn't we didn't actually say anything
to the phone because I'm code we we

125
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,519
don't know the phone numbers become a
simple phone numbers so we don't know

126
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:46,420
the phone numbers in order to fish them
you know so the result goes again

127
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:58,969
roughly similar about 22 percent said
that they would want the code

128
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:07,500
so again the results from Turkey and
motivations etc

129
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:17,389
what we found was roughly similar so why
rises happening

130
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:32,350
communications knowing that this is
actually coming from the claimed the

131
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:39,170
center right I don't know that this is
coming from google for emails and things

132
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,779
of that sort of you can maybe carefully
look at look at the email address but

133
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,879
when my grandmother and did they
probably may not understand that you in

134
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:55,209
good so there's always a small number of
people who really have no simple rain

135
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:02,290
that means of paying every detail that
yes this is indeed center and then there

136
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,959
is a lack of context right suddenly you
get something out of the blue and

137
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,099
although message and we save this is
your litigation court for what what

138
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,589
happened it doesn't say anything at all
which makes again raises the possibility

139
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,610
of then getting that quote from the
recipient because they received it

140
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:35,509
without any sort of context and also
when we designed the systems as computer

141
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:40,050
scientist at Central we think of who you
think of you as someone like you would

142
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,269
think like us but why should they being
white why should kind 150 think about

143
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,089
these things of what about these things
and if they don't is a definite I don't

144
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,559
know why would I would say not have to
design things so it works without

145
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,370
knowledge of these things

146
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,980
minimize lowest cost him and then
there's this trust in the sense you

147
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,010
handle Google message come in and the
next message coming in

148
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,100
immediately so you kind of question
because he just got a message from

149
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,610
Google Inc associate the second message
with the first of four phenomenon

150
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:24,280
happening we believe so how could this
mean freak fixed maybe the message could

151
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,160
be different maybe you could say do not
forward this message for example do not

152
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,520
forward disco down there any
circumstance and you currently doing a

153
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,630
larger more principled experiments turns
out and then to school on foreign

154
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,420
business doesn't work so does something
blue Stilton forward they tend to ignore

155
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,699
it when they'll be looking at other
types of signals that would alert them

156
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,700
and perhaps maybe the message say hey
someone tried to reset your password if

157
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:08,150
so then it's been a sort of context of
course is SMS 140 characters so there's

158
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,880
only so much you can say or maybe there
needs to be some gaming system I don't

159
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,230
know just thinking of going at this
point that perhaps like when you have

160
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,140
domain names phone numbers you have no
idea who these numbers of one who's

161
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,350
behind those phone numbers right there's
no meaning system that we have what they

162
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,710
could be a white list of some sort which
we know that these are the numbers but

163
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:41,790
how practical day or so I don't know yet
or adding some security indicators and

164
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,270
fishing sort of

165
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,319
to alleviate could reduce instances of
fifteen people have looked at hiding

166
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,610
indicators and perhaps this indicators
that could be added here that would help

167
00:16:52,610 --> 00:17:01,650
so we are looking at these kinds of
issues and it was interesting that

168
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:09,369
people would give you a verification
code just by asking them doesn't take

169
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,609
more you don't need to hide them we
don't need to do animal disaster will

170
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,879
then give it to you so that's it thank
you
