1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:11,570
I'm Jeffrey Goldberg from a job it's
you'll also see listed here Julie how

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:19,198
and Jesse are waiting to actually
sitting right there though they actually

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,710
haven't really had a chance to actually
see what I'm going to say and I should

4
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,489
point out that I security team really
like arguing with each other so in a

5
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:42,390
good way but it seems to have some very
much part of the process and so do I am

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,010
I would not be surprised if they
disagree with lots of stuff here

7
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,250
ok so who we are a job it truly make no
that's not right

8
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:03,839
ok we make a password manager one
password and internal recently we're

9
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:10,000
said we actually we until recently was
we do not host your data in any way

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,619
whatsoever we have absolutely zero
knowledge of what people do with one

11
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:20,070
password and we like this design

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:33,089
but there's also a need to be able to
get convenient to useful sharing data

13
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,490
among members of teams and so for quite
a while now we've been working on I'm

14
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:48,710
one Password four teams the beta was
introduced last month and so that

15
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,320
changes a lot of the stuff that we've
had to do while we still try to keep

16
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:07,850
this principle of we just don't want to
know anything so so my job title is

17
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,989
chief defender Against the Dark Arts
which was something that was decided on

18
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,400
after they decide after we decided that
what I was called internally which was

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:25,709
wearing one in chief was a little too
negative so so curious things that we

20
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:34,130
can worry about customers lose access to
their data data is the latest tampered

21
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:42,239
with and secrets and private information
is revealed to unauthorized entities and

22
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,410
of course by unauthorized we not
authorized by the customer we do not

23
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,620
have the power to authorize you should
not have the power to authorize who

24
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:01,390
data's release too so we work to deny
ourselves any power we shouldn't have so

25
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:11,208
we can treat better if we keep hard if
if all data is encrypted we do not have

26
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:17,680
the keys to decrypt that data and we
aren't in a position to acquire those

27
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,440
keys and that third point is what I'm
going to be focusing on now

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:36,170
so roughly speaking there are two ways
that we could acquire keys when somebody

29
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,739
just doesn't normal password login to
the site

30
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:49,380
they're sending their password and so
any fighter service temporarily acquires

31
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,600
a using secret that way they had shit
but they are in a position to directly

32
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:03,540
acquiring is a secret another way to
acquire a using secret is to have

33
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,000
something like a password hash they can
be used for making guesses against that

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,670
can be used for tracking so we want to
avoid not only never seeing the secret

35
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:30,680
secret directly we do not want to see a
hash that can be used so this is just

36
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:39,130
another way of saying that if Y is a
hash of P then even though you can't

37
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,180
even though the hash function may be
great

38
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,540
cryptographically her shaped all of the
things that you expect from a hash

39
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:58,030
function it does not stop you from using
why as a way to test whether you have

40
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:04,409
guessed the right P and if he is low
entropy then this can actually be useful

41
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,800
thing everyone who does after tracking
mostess

42
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,840
ok so now I'm going to just talk about
the things that we would want in an

43
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,539
authentication protocol and because
until now we've never done

44
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,840
authentication everything was just local
creeks encryption there was no

45
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:38,969
interaction with our services services
we actually started having to worry

46
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,409
about indication so the first thing you
want is that the client proves its

47
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:49,259
identity to the safe that's what
everyone does

48
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:56,750
we also would like this server to prove
its identity to the client this is

49
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:04,259
typically but you rely on TLS for but we
would also like to have that we don't

50
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,469
want to leak any secrets to an
eavesdropper we don't want anything that

51
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:20,680
can be replayed we don't want to reveal
any secrets to the server and we like to

52
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,960
negotiate a key that can be used to
encrypt the session and finally this

53
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,710
thing that I keep I'm getting around to
is we don't want this server to obtain

54
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,940
information that could be used for
tracking so we're trying to do we're

55
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,159
we're trying to make it so that if
somebody get our hashes they can't do

56
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:53,580
anything with it

57
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:02,560
password login that's the wrong the
wrong comment only one ignore ignore the

58
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,050
bad numbers for their vanilla password
login only does my client whose identity

59
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,520
to the server

60
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,650
that was supposed to be a different
flight a password authenticated key

61
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:28,590
exchange protocol does all of those
things that we were looking for

62
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:35,729
except for the last one it does provide
some it does have something stored on

63
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:44,800
the server that can be used for lunch
get crackin attack and that's where that

64
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
number forest run

65
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,289
multi-factor typical you know I mean
there of course different instances of

66
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,818
these things but that typical way of
doing multi-factor authentication so

67
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,800
you've got a password login and then
you're using something like TOTP for

68
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,860
something else it reinforces it beefs up
the number one the client proving itself

69
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,870
to the server because it's proving
itself in multiple ways and typically

70
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:29,880
the second factor is a one-time password
so it helps resist replace ok now if you

71
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,020
can't see that their sign on that Gates
has noticed keep gate closed and locked

72
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:42,490
now as exceed the game actually isn't
locked so we've got a real problem here

73
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:52,720
and you know so we need to have some
kind of authentication system to secure

74
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,440
this so and let's say a combination like
to the game

75
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:07,480
and the combination is something you
know and we can improve that by adding

76
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,510
to lock that has a key with something
you have and if we really want to go to

77
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,930
really the top notch best security for
this system possible we can added yet

78
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:31,150
another factor is something you are we
could have a fingerprint scanner that ok

79
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,490
that was my rant about multi-factor
authentication point is that it is not

80
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,630
addressing the problem we want to solve
it may be addressing some useful

81
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:49,439
problems in some circumstances but
multi-factor authentication does not

82
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:58,090
solve does not protect a customer
against us over breach at all and so

83
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:05,730
it's a lot of extra work we heard
earlier today about the burden she put

84
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:29,529
on users by adding yet more work for
them to do so

85
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:57,139
about some of the things to consider
when different security problem anyway

86
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:30,130
john we'll be talking about that later
today

87
00:11:30,130 --> 00:12:12,980
it's generated by the station and stored
locally by the clock using is not

88
00:12:12,980 --> 00:13:54,560
expected to to know this day and so so
this is a high ankle

89
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:16,650
combining things like and the email
address and we get by without that and

90
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:41,520
then we run this week we're about to end
but you know we had the talk yesterday

91
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:51,949
about the pain of these this to happen
while you're doing all of this file

92
00:14:51,950 --> 00:15:09,760
inside and so it is easy to implement in
awhile so so fortunately the path of

93
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,080
help you competition haven't thought
they did stuff that isn't that except

94
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:26,610
for make while but all of that about
memory hardness are really kind of

95
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:36,080
killing that it's hard to get into
trying anything we go

96
00:15:36,080 --> 00:16:00,680
together he get and then we export those
things together that lending you the

97
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:16,189
mastic pass where he or five people to
call if you know the actual people call

98
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,040
the protocol don't worry about it but
that's the key

99
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:41,849
used that line in secret used for
authentication we also use this method

100
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:54,570
were just different fault and it uses a
different in those hands so to dip in

101
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:09,500
salsa complete even in the worst case we
wouldn't want anything to be use to

102
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,160
actually

103
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:28,430
gonna say ok we're done we saw this is
actually the hard stuff so that may

104
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:43,600
actually all that hard

105
00:17:43,600 --> 00:18:25,789
typical problem and we actually seen in
the beta period how these things are

106
00:18:25,789 --> 00:19:11,820
working out and I'm some kind of a death
would allow the county to be stolen

107
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:56,129
any word has to be but it's much easier
to reach a person's machine and snow

108
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:47,120
back to factory and neither is the
combination

109
00:20:47,120 --> 00:24:21,330
so how so

110
00:24:21,330 --> 00:25:40,960
and I have to actually
