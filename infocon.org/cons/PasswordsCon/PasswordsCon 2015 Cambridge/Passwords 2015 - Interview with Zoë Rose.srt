1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
so my name is on the phone or password
scone and I'm sitting here with sodium

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:12,009
please introduce yourself and who you
are I'm very rose come from Canada which

3
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,110
apparently I'm not the only Canadian
though that's critical your speakers are

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,560
as I would I do I work at NOC in an ISP
and

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,169
and i own a company that's a mystique
and why did you come to Patrick's

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,130
College Cambridge in the UK but season
when was I wanted to go to a conference

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,628
this December came up

8
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:42,769
secondly I really security and that sort
of saying this is kind of want to get

9
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:46,250
into and so I thought this would be a
really need experience to learn about

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,909
stuff that most of my people don't
really know about and it's a new

11
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:58,100
comrades but it's also a completely new
location recording at that sort of

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,390
intake from other people looking for new
contacts possible new job maybe no

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,710
comment may be ok well so what do you
think about the first I'll pass respond

14
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:20,960
I wasn't it wasn't too long like they're
kinda sleeping but nobody was really

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,100
good it was really informative and you
had some very diverse stocks absolutely

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,408
you know that's one of the things I'm
really looking for you to get for the

17
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,229
conference as well as also do one of the
reasons why I'm trying to mix the

18
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,079
academic community with the research
community and you know around the world

19
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:45,749
so I'm going to try but I'm really happy
with they want it was it was really good

20
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:52,359
and I was impressed with the type of
talks how you separated them cos there

21
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,699
was like 140

22
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,930
higher than they all kind of came
together anyway and I know there was a

23
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,100
good representation of different aspects
but also different genders that's always

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,038
really cool I would you recommend this
conference by anybody else like for next

25
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,790
year maybe of course I'll probably be
back next year as long as I have any

26
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,220
money

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:20,590
well you know we gotta do something
about that okay well I'm in a pleasure

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,330
to have you have so far and i'm looking
forward to see you back again tomorrow

29
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,610
and there is no capes here though so I'm
a little disheartened by the lack of

30
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,160
Cape a superhero cape we we have to get
that for the next conference if we can

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,470
get it for tomorrow we need up next
conference

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,959
absolutely well thank you so we enjoy
the rest of the evening
