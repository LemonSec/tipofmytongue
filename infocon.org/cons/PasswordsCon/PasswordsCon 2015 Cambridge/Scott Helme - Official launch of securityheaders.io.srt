1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:08,540
precisely a last minute I don't have any
/ Pat / I was going to do in the lining

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,849
session of the night but I wasn't ready
but as I've only slight that category

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:25,269
out passwords the only real side I need
is this one so alongside the site report

4
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:29,549
you're either I wrote that does CSP an
eight-week AP reporting I built another

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,020
little too long lines to help me with
some research and it basically just as I

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,180
can go to and analyzes the HTTP response
headers of any site that you type in so

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,670
you can get an idea of whether they're
deploying things like CSP PKP whether

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,260
they issue they just yet as a few of the
security-based headers but it was quite

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,540
cold just you know about color coding
give you the information you know about

10
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:03,820
traction so I wanted to rebuild in
relaunching I took a lot of inspiration

11
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,100
from anyone else equal status all tax
bill by Ivan Ristic the hole grading

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,449
system what really attractive is quite
nice that people kind of take these

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,180
screenshots oh poor schools and then can
use in to encourage organizations with

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,890
china improve things so last night after
these actions I launch the new version

15
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:32,700
of my service which is available online
now and everybody can literally going to

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,450
do this now this is life this is the new
version I've taken a lot of inspiration

17
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,200
from the College tossed so there's now a
grading system on that you can go to the

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,549
sian type in an address and literally
been a few seconds it will do the

19
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,500
analysis will go great getting feedback
on how does the are implemented on

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,250
implemented links to additional
information resources to read up on what

21
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,540
they are and why and you know a simple
case

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:16,920
yeah I was gonna be neutral that so I so
I always feel dot com dot is a see ya at

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:28,220
the wrong time right let me try when I
was going to you see how about CIA

24
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,790
eventually decide you want to use time
is quite difficult to kind of great on

25
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,109
redirect because some of the head is
still apply some of them don't there's

26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,170
no content on the page are you gonna get
this will be a school i still show this

27
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,290
because there are some head is the
duvalier administrators may want to

28
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,540
check whether or not the Irishman things
but if the science kind of guy redirect

29
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,000
to post this line up here to say you
know this is a redirect you simply click

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,310
the Follow and it will then follow the
redirect some size you know du chein

31
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,860
multiple redirects apologize fly boy you
eventually get to score screen so in

32
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,640
Kuala style kind of Baroda you know they
lay on the grading system here and you

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,950
just got a simple school alyssa has
implemented on implemented oversight

34
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,548
role has any other information in there
and give feedback on things like you

35
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,570
know the survey shows all the
information that's a few of his eyes

36
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,329
while they don't have that kind of
advisory is why I put them in blue they

37
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,720
don't actually care anyway in the
scoring system you'll be missing head is

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,410
so it's also kind of my protocol
specific as well so this issue this

39
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,920
somehow does that you don't issue over
HTTP like strict security public keeping

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,929
things like that so is context aware of
the protocol decisive Dover and you can

41
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,790
link out to the site you know blogs I
have information on what they had to

42
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,769
raise a child to keep kind of like
simple one-line description of what they

43
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,140
are to be fairly user-friendly if you
want the additional technical

44
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,290
information then you have to click
through into links to other articles

45
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,829
by the hope is that if you do things
right to try and drive people to do

46
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,160
things dry you know it is really pretty
again

47
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,850
stick with the whole color scheme of
things here that big a plus

48
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,190
this is also a mobile-friendly Morsy
said quite nice because you can

49
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,530
literally just grab a screenshot of like
the Summary section between think saying

50
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:42,599
like hey why does my bank getting that
so yeah it's i mean this is just to try

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,460
and kind of you know give people some
information is it really focuses really

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,430
easy you know you can look at it but you
know there's no real reason so I'm

53
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,440
hoping that the new grading system now
rather than just like the basic text

54
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,389
layout before

55
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:04,919
give you know people something to go to
an organization with in the beat you i

56
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,219
kind of only seeing that this this does
work during the beating the supersized

57
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,830
god-like degrade the come up in orange
and inspired me to look at and think

58
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,180
about you know I don't miss this is you
know this is terrible I got these

59
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,380
degrade it looks body got red things
everywhere

60
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,949
enjoying the beetle that she went away
and came back and I now like a great so

61
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,020
you know this doesn't work I'm hoping
this will go out like a slightly bigger

62
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:36,280
scale and kind of give encouragement and
you know the information all in one nice

63
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:43,330
concise little report he will now be no
quick you a session guys try don't open

64
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:43,620
it

65
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,830
sconce some sites we go back to the
homepage hopefully we can see all of

66
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,330
these counts here alive so the recent
gun just kind of cascades down Hall of

67
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,130
Fame ara plus if you want to get in
there again i woulda cycle three recent

68
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,590
size is very much like the call this a
cell to see how she not be very familiar

69
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,780
with the fall mouse and hopefully you
know people are out a scanning now

70
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,510
refresh and say that but a few more

71
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:22,010
so yeah I was just gonna come up in the
zone aligning talk session but we do

72
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,300
have time to get around to that so I
thought presented now thank you very

73
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,630
much
