1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:19,640
I would really like to hear what she has
incredibly cool their job which you can

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:34,969
ask me about how she's going to talk
about

3
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:47,870
thanks fair because I've been doing
research on Islamic state for about 10

4
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,709
months and it scares me so I was like
I'll stay home and then I'll can watch

5
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,180
will come so this talk is put together
in the seven days since then but with

6
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,149
materials have gathered for the last
year so who am I so I do security

7
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:08,400
research that's just greedy research and
other kinds of research I do projects

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,670
that last six months or a year and then
I do something else and so about eight

9
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,009
months ago I started paying attention to
the presence of the diet Slavic state

10
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,170
people on Twitter and then expand it out
from there so I do whatever security

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,560
research I'm interested in last year's
presentation was on behavioral

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,720
biometrics as a way to extend the
usefulness of passwords right totally

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,090
different than this I took on to the
next thing I work for the US government

14
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,479
part time I have a really cool job you
can ask me about it but I do not

15
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,770
represent them here they have nothing to
do with what I'm doing on the internet

16
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,530
my job has nothing to do with the
internet nothing to do with prices they

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,500
don't know I'm here it's ok

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,020
if they find out of here they don't
probably care from here but they don't

19
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,070
know I'm here they didn't have anything
to do with this other thing I want to

20
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,410
say is I i sort of a couple hours ago
had this vision of myself and I thought

21
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,829
you know what I am I my anti Isis cyber
vigilante that's what I am I'm out there

22
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm going after him and then I was like
man it's more like a neighborhood watch

23
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,830
and then realized it's more like the
little lady sitting in the house like

24
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:38,130
throwing shit people so just full
disclaimer that too I am require and I'm

25
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,510
gonna do a really bad thing

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:47,049
pair

27
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:56,990
okay i three kind of money talks the
first one's gonna be about

28
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,290
says hackers are and then I'm gonna talk
a little bit about passwords that I

29
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,910
obtained from leaks that they made or we
call them not because they're not

30
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,530
hackers but they are leaks that somebody
made at some point in time and they

31
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,050
repurposing them some of the leaks or
their leaks or some Malaysian guy who

32
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,170
gave them the leaks and then the last
thing is going to be the role of

33
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,399
passwords in this version of
cyberwarfare like we think about real

34
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,580
cyberwarfare ticking down critical
infrastructure and taking down the

35
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,340
financials they're going to do that and
have the skills to do that but there is

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,530
this sort of smaller-scale cyber warfare
going on and passwords play passwords in

37
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,560
the ability to craft things plays a role
in that ok so this is some of the names

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,590
they've gone by the beginning the press
was calling calling them the cyber Calif

39
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,560
it they call themselves to the islamic
cyber army and the people who don't like

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,850
them like may call them the Islamic
cloud army and we Photoshop their images

41
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,239
with clown noses and Joe sorts of things
like that right now they're calling

42
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,739
themselves the elite section of the
Islamic State something like that there

43
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,079
was another crew that is probably the
same people that call themselves just

44
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,750
very clever call themselves the
terrorists get that and then there are a

45
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:32,450
few people still using the on on ghost
group name to do activities on behalf of

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,320
the islamics

47
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,169
Islamic state when do that a lot is not
an Islamic state but it's ok so an

48
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,770
ongoing source actually a group that
started not sure how long though maybe

49
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,680
fifteen months ago maybe longer and it's
a pro palestine hacker group Anonymous

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,950
so it is an anonymous group

51
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,260
that hacks primarily Israel on behalf of
palestinians and there's a few people

52
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,530
have spun off from that and have gone to
Isis so it's a little confusing because

53
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:13,840
the pro palestine israeli hacking people
are not Isis people so there's that

54
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
using some symbolism but it's two
different groups ok so what do the

55
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,680
Islamic State I says hackers do they
mainly deface websites they do a lot of

56
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:32,170
the hijacked Twitter accounts they
hijacked them primarily so that they

57
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,190
have lots of extra counts lying around
which I'll tell you about hotel should

58
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,140
do release these data leaks most of them
are not there leaks but some of them are

59
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:50,840
and I'll show you some of those also a
lot of the things they declare are leaks

60
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,390
are actually just things they googled so
they'll go you know here at the home

61
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,990
addresses of the members of parliament
yes thank you write things like that end

62
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,520
here

63
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,940
hero the domain addresses for this group
of government entities so things that

64
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,050
are just known and they make a big deal
about it so I i'm calling the group that

65
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,500
helps them this unofficial internet
truth squad right now I think that the

66
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,790
person who did most of this is part of a
group called The Ghost security group

67
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,110
but it was called something else when he
did images on the show you but basically

68
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,380
what they would do is find the source of
the leak and then do these images which

69
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,270
I'll show you now this is the real kind
of risky dangerous part some of the

70
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,500
lifts are actually alone for long walks
and they say specifically this is a kill

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,710
list kill these people and then they
have the bleak those don't tend to be

72
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,419
password username leaks they tend to be
home addresses and other details like

73
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,889
that

74
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,639
and Paris me that's why are they having
taken over this territory they're doing

75
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,770
whatever the reason why they hacking the
only reason that that group is hacking

76
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,349
is a young man from the UK joined
Islamic state joined us his name was

77
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:20,248
changed her saying he went trick he was
a hacker from here but here and he went

78
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:23,430
to Syria and he married a woman he'd met
here

79
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,979
older woman who was a notorious hacker
flag sorry for anybody that insults but

80
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,279
that's what she was and they went to
Syria and they did a lot of stuff on

81
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,719
social media to recruit new people and
they also arranged for a bombing to

82
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:47,240
happen I think it was in London and
because of that and because of their

83
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,099
social media activity the United States
drone June 8 hissing and then killed so

84
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:58,479
that was a phase of the hacking the
region 8 getting drunk phase and then

85
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,568
there's the after june 8 had some skills
in English teaching other people his

86
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:09,219
skills and then he was debt so what
happens when he's gone is basically just

87
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:16,919
stupid stupid crap this is him and this
is actually the image it's really out of

88
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,810
focus because this is a cutout of the
image from those who are we going to

89
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:28,270
drawn notice and right now the cooler we
gonna draw notice has his wife she's on

90
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:36,000
that they're trying to find her she's
still she just posted the guy who killed

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,299
think the guy who killed Osama bin Laden
she just posted all his personal details

92
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:46,310
and said you all go to go get him so
that that's what they do write these are

93
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,000
a couple of images that I stumbled upon
I want to share the first the top 10

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,790
polarise want it is kinda cool cuz its
US armored up guy

95
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,280
and you know he's just cool name and
never seen him since this one time the

96
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,370
bottom image is that a non ghost that
was talking about which you you will see

97
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,740
its not regular anonymous and it's not
Islamic state it's the pro-palestinian

98
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,780
hackers

99
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,240
years the image that the terrorists did
and again I don't know whether this is

100
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,210
the same some of the same people that
are on the crew now but the terrorist

101
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,710
organization of electronic jihad that's
the kind of language that they yards and

102
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,640
these are more images from that group
they do a lot of when they do face the

103
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,140
post it at the Stone Age which I'm sure
will hacking people know about i dont

104
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,670
and then a lot of this we're terrorists
language so in May they put out their

105
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,760
first video they put out this video
about you know that they were taking

106
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,470
over the cyber world and they were going
to control everything and they had all

107
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,250
the American data and it didn't it
wasn't particularly good or particularly

108
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,870
credible but the thing that was
interesting about it is first of all

109
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,900
they want to tell us about the whole
world they want to tell america and that

110
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:10,180
is who they did at first was urs the
things interesting is this image up in

111
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,349
the right is a media and long and tips
for the most part before that the rest

112
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,680
of Isis didn't pay any attention to this
hacking stuff is pretty much just ignore

113
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,469
them

114
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,120
does it get it two different worlds
right this is the first sign that

115
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,380
they're getting some recognition in the
bottom we've got to the media house logo

116
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,020
we're going to flag and then the
computer screen so this is this is a

117
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,390
sort of official media house emblem for
technology

118
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:51,630
you know more fair and just enter soon
you won't have any control over the

119
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,040
Internet

120
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,759
yet I don't I'm not really too worried
that they're going to take over control

121
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,089
of the internet but there's a lot of
this kind of language lot smarter

122
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:07,480
spelling errors that you know just the
kind of sloppy ok this is the current

123
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,269
caruso after Junaid geysers a is blown
to bits

124
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:20,199
there's a law and then the crew starts
to do things the crew starts out and it

125
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:27,410
the five its clients cyber Albemarle Dr
I system and engineer ices and it's at

126
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,600
five if you notice we have elite sex is
in this film stuff wrong all the time

127
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,139
they spell islamic wrong this both state
brought this fellow everything wrong

128
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:46,110
which is great fodder for trolls who
want to roll them so at some point they

129
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,160
pick up a bunch extra people then to
being nine and then go back to seven and

130
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,759
then there six and now they're five
again these are three of their emblems

131
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,730
if you notice the one on the on the left
that stain on Ghost Face that we saw

132
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:09,329
before that Isis uses that he's the one
who is responsible for stealing all the

133
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:16,500
Twitter accounts and then re-
redistributed read distributing them so

134
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,610
the strategy that that's good guys have
is to get as many Isis supporter account

135
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,899
suspended as possible and their goal is
to put them back in action as quickly as

136
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:32,440
possible and so they they generate they
create new accounts and they still

137
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,870
account they have at the last I got a
number they had 55,000 account sort of

138
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,189
waiting they probably given out five six
thousand so they have lot we're afraid

139
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:48,250
they're gonna make a pot but they don't
seem to be able to make a pot so that's

140
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,030
good

141
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,780
sort of system eyes hacking start there
are some other stuff that happens in

142
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,650
this is one of them they put out the
spaceman and they've defaced all these

143
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,939
sites

144
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,570
take a quick read of the kinds of sites
or defacing basically they're scanning

145
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,780
out there for things this is maybe based
on June 8 teaching their their their

146
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,209
learning they're learning to scan and
look for sites to have something that

147
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:22,400
they can get into for people who are
hackers they're using a tool called you

148
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,150
many shell and often on their screen
shots you see the header on their screen

149
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:37,430
and you can see it they've gotta
bookmark shell and I have it I managed

150
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,280
to get it on what the hell to do it so
also on this when you see they have been

151
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,240
media house emblems right this is pretty
much the last time we're going to see

152
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,340
the media house homes as soon as June 8
it's gone they don't have any more

153
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,950
credibility they seem to be wanted to
get the attention of the Islamic State

154
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,860
get some recognition but they're not
they're not getting it until of course

155
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,330
yesterday when they put a new video out
just for me but I was coming so they put

156
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:09,730
a new video out but they pretty much
lost it took over the hijacked the

157
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,900
Twitter account of the USC central
command to that was but you know it's

158
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
not that hard to take over Twitter
account

159
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,160
ok so we look at some of the passwords
again there weren't leaks and you'll see

160
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,660
I have specifically what the sources
were for some of them the first thing

161
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,449
that I knew that they snatched was what
appeared to be a procurement system that

162
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,550
involved you US government transactions
and it had full name phone number user

163
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:50,630
name password everything thousands and
thousands of records and you know

164
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,500
I don't know why they release the stuff
I mean it might have been useful for

165
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,860
them to just use it use it for fraud but
they didn't do that they're released the

166
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,040
next thing they released they were going
after I believe that was because they

167
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,599
were trying to find you s military the
next thing that they released was

168
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,340
username password everything from a sign
up

169
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:18,400
site for recreation programs for you US
military so that's not good and from

170
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,130
that and from that maybe the hatch from
the Malaysian guy I haven't put it

171
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,910
together they put together these wanted
notices and so if you ever see them it's

172
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,680
it's green or purple images got a
picture of aus military person their

173
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,709
home address their name all the contact
information and they say they tweak

174
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,010
those out with wanted to kill not good
thing so they made you so this this that

175
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,590
was that was a real have made use of it
and they continue to make use of it

176
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:56,220
right there doesn't seem to be a system
in place by Twitter to identify those

177
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,790
images when they pop up again and
automatically take them down so every

178
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,630
time they pop up everytime I see green
or purple on my screen look and see if

179
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,670
it's that and then listen everybody see
banks they have to rally you know five

180
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,329
hundred people reportedly hit the
algorithm to take it down on that that's

181
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:24,800
how you get crap off of Twitter ok so
before the systematic hacking but they

182
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,430
started to do they did this this was a
company website called chart male

183
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,709
Belgian company that does like stock
information and this one but I want to

184
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,850
tell you guys' when euro cyber vigilante
but you're not a cyber person and you

185
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,930
don't know anybody and you don't want to
call anybody cuz your work you have to

186
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,030
figure out what to do but what am I
gonna do I find this user names

187
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:54,130
passwords also to contact stuff my first
run-in with what I thought was new and I

188
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,560
like

189
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,739
have been pot I'll send it to dry so I
can add them to have I been pawn

190
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,580
and what trying to us he tweeted out
with the link it says there might be

191
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:12,600
seen their defense on the link to the
leak ok and so somebody pull some of the

192
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,709
day off and try to log into trouble when
they do and get this so surreal leak and

193
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,390
something's been done about it probably
not what I would now do about it but

194
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,420
that's what got done but it this is a
systematic hacking process they went

195
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,150
through and this is in order but this is
what they did they would pick our

196
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,220
country and start tweeting soon we're
gonna treat we're gonna do whatever

197
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,110
under hacks America under hacks and then
they would have candy face for a week

198
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:50,040
and this just released a whole bunch of
stuff right now or last week was ruled

199
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,060
under hacks I think it's still world
under hacks but as a right now they're

200
00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:06,379
releasing UK data stuff okay here's from
russia under hacks what school in these

201
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,110
guys apparently all speak Arabic they
haven't recruited and chechens so they

202
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,820
hacked this site and they get his
username username passwords and and

203
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,550
emails but they don't know what the hell
it is so it's just some Russian packed

204
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,980
some Russian site so here you go

205
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,830
here's the data now one thing I'll tell
you when they released like this they

206
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,720
released a screenshot like maybe 40 80
records once in awhile though they're

207
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,190
putting up a spin and they'll still
share a link and what I thought was

208
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,400
really interesting to do was to talk
them until they would give me the link

209
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,370
to the actual leak which is why I have
some of the actual leaks that I have

210
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,899
because I would just relentlessly tell
them they weren't hackers and they

211
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,530
really improved it until you give us the
whole thing

212
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,950
then they hand over the whole thing so I
have a couple like that we're actually

213
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,660
worked as I do understand English but
they don't understand russians I don't

214
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,260
have a tweet that goes with this but I
know parents said we need Arabic Arabic

215
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,150
passwords

216
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:19,400
well here's an Arabic but the passwords
are not in Arabic their Latin alphabet

217
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,090
and I had no idea what this was and I
want to tell you some of those sort of

218
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,770
tricks that I figured out as I was going
along so I'm looking at this level I

219
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:36,840
have a whole list 54,000 record and I
sorted by password and I find this on

220
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,300
the right side and I like that maybe I
should check Saudi Telecom Saudi the

221
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,500
suspect that saudi cell phone numbers
and see if these are cell phone numbers

222
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,320
in these are the perfect size for Saudi
it so you don't have this year at the

223
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,070
beginning it starts with a 55 and so
there are lots and lots and lots of

224
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,720
passwords in this league that are
obviously cell phone numbers

225
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:09,580
Saudi Telecom and their their their
initial password that they assigned as

226
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,310
your phone number and then you're
supposed to change it to all the 12

227
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,480
still have the phone numbers are ones
where people get reset their passwords I

228
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,100
have no idea I am guessing right but
that's the kind of research I tried to

229
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,320
do as I found these leaks and this is
the reason I'm here because I want to

230
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,490
show you guys use images cause they're
funny so for whatever reason the

231
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,220
extremely observe it

232
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,740
Islamic state hackers decided to release
Playboy and other porn site user names

233
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,550
and passwords and anywhere else so if
you wanted to visit a porn site you

234
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,909
would then have the information so the
top one is that actually URL for the

235
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,530
porn site if you wanna make a list

236
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:01,129
but I thought these were entertaining
because of the passwords so yeah so I

237
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:07,340
love sex so this one is not as funny but
look at all these great all great

238
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,270
through the distributing this to all
their very observant islamic friends

239
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:19,850
this list of porn sites I can go to
there's a little bit of one of the

240
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,550
reasons I thought this was really
interesting as I had looked through the

241
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,490
procurement procurement passwords I had
looked through the treadmill passwords

242
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:34,010
and I had in my head the stupid kind of
passwords that people make the port site

243
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:40,430
passwords are different than the other
passwords people insert personal

244
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,730
information into their passwords that
they probably wouldn't on their

245
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:52,580
employers website just normal but anyway
here's this is my favorite im just gonna

246
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,169
say this because I was sitting back
there waiting to talk

247
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:04,940
laughing I player that's my favorite
it's about a little below half way down

248
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:14,410
I don't know why I find that really
amusing I pulled from the 54 here's a

249
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:24,480
small part of the list right so I think
they're eleven or twelve minecraft

250
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:36,150
yeah and there's some other is the other
one I like to share was mathematic man I

251
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,410
want to know the guy goes the porn site
and fix the password mathematically but

252
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:46,330
don't want this to me was just very
entertaining I really wanted to share

253
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,780
which is why I initially thought I come
and talk but it's actually gotten more

254
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:59,320
serious so other areas they have they
have a right they've got the addresses

255
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,678
for employees of whatever the
communication national communications

256
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:12,169
offices for France and they have a
claimed list of Mossad agents it's not

257
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,520
it's been debunked but they're still
putting it out there and then also one

258
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,260
of my favorites they did face these
sites the sites up here in Aram upon the

259
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:31,450
top and my favorite is Quran J pizza so
periodically when these sites are to

260
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,370
face I go back and check and see if
they're still faced right so after about

261
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:45,510
16 hours quick to render a pit and ICP
and then I have to buy the other thing

262
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:52,740
that I found and I don't I don't think I
have the link to it now is comics so

263
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,330
there's a really awesome comic shop in
Iran called around comics and they have

264
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,559
a telegram channel and you should get on
and get join their channel cause they're

265
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,710
great and they have great new Batman

266
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,480
and images and stuff so you know you
take you take the good with the bad era

267
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,440
couple others you can see their imagery
these are their tweets so there

268
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,080
including these these images and these
are the places they usually spell things

269
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:27,039
wrong and just see the list of sites
have not that they don't understand what

270
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,620
they're happy so they just tax stuff and
say these are soldiers and they're not

271
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,389
the problem is they're putting their
names and home addresses and informing

272
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,870
the people who read their stuff that
their soldiers so they may be creating

273
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,239
some some big risks this is one of those
lists and I've blocked out pretty much

274
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,640
the whole list and I'll tell you I saw
this list box this is the only time I

275
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,779
went through another person to say the
FBI needs to notify these people now

276
00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:07,179
because whoever is actually on this list
is very poor operational security so one

277
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:10,429
of the guys on the list you can see his
first name is Chris Benz Chris been

278
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,710
named as their Chris Van has a Facebook
account

279
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:20,620
Brisbane uses the future where you can
update where you are as you go to new

280
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,039
places which would be really convenient
for the lone wolf record record how long

281
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,129
will I was looking for you he's just
updating every time he gets a new

282
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:37,929
climate the health club so I suggested
that somebody tell him to stop doing

283
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:45,740
that while this was out there this is an
article that I inspired to have written

284
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,440
so this was about France on perhaps
after days of promising that they would

285
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,100
release the results of their efforts to
hack the French the self-named Islamic

286
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,699
state hackers spent two days in the
result of googling French government

287
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:06,110
websites so yeah alright so these are
the debunking images so these actually

288
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,758
went out on Twitter as things were
happening so they say they claim they

289
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:15,799
had these and they kept the list you
know they put the pastebin out of the

290
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,729
Facebook accounts and then somebody
checks in the old hack and they claim

291
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:26,989
they have to Nassau publicly available
they claim they hacked locations of the

292
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:35,049
FBI agent names in homes and that was
somebody else's hack from 2012 this is a

293
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:42,049
big 12 me they claim they have the bank
they did have that bank but they claimed

294
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,759
it was in the you s the name of it
confuse them but the other problem is

295
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,079
that they that they also have another
bank and i wanna talk about it but I

296
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:56,009
have no images on purpose to tell you
which bank it is so they took over a

297
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:02,059
bank's website and what they did is they
disabled all the the links on the

298
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,489
homepage on all the pages but on the
homepage they disable all the links the

299
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:10,079
only thing that still worked where the
blanks to put in your username and/or

300
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,428
password which they would then intercept
when people try to log and I pinned

301
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:21,339
against that bank for hours and hours
and hours and finally despite the fact

302
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:29,069
that I try not to do this I'm a witness
an observer called back but that was a

303
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:32,209
real hack they really took control of
that bank's website and they could have

304
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:37,749
gotten the information before it got in
and i got you know they're getting a

305
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:44,519
plain-text ok so here's another one they
released credit card data and it was

306
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,970
actually four months before

307
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,500
release like a hundred credit card
little screenshots of people's credit

308
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,980
card information and then i would tell
them you know you can buy this on the

309
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,010
dark web for like 25 cents each

310
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,220
you know things like that but they would
release those things and they probably

311
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,600
did actually obtain them through hacking
but the whole idea was just to

312
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,340
continually suggest that they were
idiots and incompetent and just

313
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:22,470
reinforce that ok this is what the
internet did about the good guy internet

314
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,020
people did about the porn week and this
is kind of interesting so these are all

315
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:33,280
the images for the porn leak and all
this is is believed it ran the basically

316
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,190
says you should have done that and
that's it

317
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,159
tweeted that out mentioning their names
and just you know with their hash tags

318
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:41,850
and stuff

319
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:51,590
ok so the role of passwords in
cyberwarfare ok so they use passwords to

320
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,428
other people's accounts now that's not
totally true I don't think they actually

321
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:01,390
need the passwords they're using another
method for hijacking accounts they don't

322
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,740
need to crack the passwords they need to
crack the emails so when you reset your

323
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,070
Twitter account it shows you the first
two characters you email the number of

324
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,860
characters will stars and then the
domain they're guessing that and then

325
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,918
their way of taking over that email
account and resetting your password

326
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,440
taking the account holder but they don't
need they don't seem to need the

327
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,570
passwords but I do know for sure that
one of the their hacker accounts was

328
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,678
stolen because for whatever reason for
that day they'd use Allah Akbar as a

329
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,510
password and somebody guessed it and
took their accounts so there are pure

330
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,770
password situations so the reason to
take over the account is to change the

331
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,190
narrative to accuse them of being spies
to whatever you gonna do with it

332
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,340
the big thing that happened with
hijacking accounts

333
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:05,168
is not just hijacking them but it is
really with hijacking is to lure lure

334
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:10,510
them to click on links that will give up
their location and then tell them that

335
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,500
you have their location and what that
then did is created the environment

336
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,250
where nobody affiliated with them will
click on any links and what you think

337
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,990
about going to Twitter and never
clicking a link it's not useful right

338
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,880
and it's not just on Twitter they've
been trained now not too quickly so tall

339
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,190
and that's based on a large part of a
strolling activity so what the good guys

340
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:42,130
are doing is also taking over account
they take over the ISIS account and

341
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:50,100
change the narrative part of the goal of
the trolling is to distract them from

342
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,500
what they're doing so if the hackers are
in the middle

343
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,289
hackers are in the middle of releasing
about your data if you can take away a

344
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:01,899
minute of their time at thirty seconds
of their time repeatedly and delay it be

345
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:08,760
annoying you know that's strongly right
but maybe push them off of Twitter

346
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,390
because at some point it becomes too
which is what happened right to the end

347
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,470
up going to tell around which they
occupied for about eight weeks he'll

348
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,770
probably got fed up and kick them out

349
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:28,320
alright so this is an example of an
account that this is the bad part right

350
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,250
so they steal people's accounts to use
and then they say so this accounts get

351
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,190
hacked by the hackers of the Calvin this
is a hijacked account this is somebody

352
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,600
else's Twitter account you can identify
pretty easily if you go back in history

353
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,500
you can see it was created three years
ago and it's got all three tweets about

354
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,970
soccer and then nothing for two years

355
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,220
and then this crap you think Twitter
could pick it out but they don't want

356
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:07,510
out of time so I won't show you this I
will show you this because this is asked

357
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:17,690
me about this if you want to write so
the role of the passwords in 23224 the

358
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,390
role of passwords in cyberwarfare I
believe that these guys are going to

359
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,400
learn they're gonna get technical help
they're gonna pay people to help them

360
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,460
because Calif it is in bad shape right
now financially their lesson last

361
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,350
options for getting money and I think
cyber is going to become more inviting

362
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,100
if they can figure out how to get money
out of the game I don't know if they can

363
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,809
and that's why I say there was a bank
they've already had this experience of

364
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:51,908
successfully taking over the bank the
bank website so I'm not gonna show you

365
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:56,280
the rest of slides but what I'm gonna
say is the reason this image is here is

366
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,860
that pretty much everybody I tell you
how to report this crap on the internet

367
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,059
says it's not my job

368
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:07,100
the government will do it and the
providers will do it and I want

369
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:13,678
everybody in to YouTube nobody uses you
to define really nasty crap on YouTube

370
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,140
you go out not my problem

371
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:24,580
flag flag right well that's a problem
because union doesn't take it down the

372
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,760
government doesn't take it down West's
key part ok if you want to go on if it's

373
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,919
actually offensive if you don't want
your you know twelve year old to be

374
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,470
sitting next to you and that whatever
just a pop-up yeah reported and I'm not

375
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,770
saying a recruiting video beheadings
head pops up on your YouTube

376
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:47,740
you see link on on Twitter just report
it doesn't take that long I'm gonna jump

377
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,670
ahead to one slide because it's really
funny ok

378
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,270
so Obama can stop us now that we have
all seven Dragon Balls right when you

379
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:03,760
take back the Dragon Ball right can't
let them have a trackball thank you any

380
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,640
questions you get me later
