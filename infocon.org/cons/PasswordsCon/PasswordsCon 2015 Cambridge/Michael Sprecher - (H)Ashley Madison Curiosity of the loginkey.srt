1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,298
next before I like it all

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:21,529
senator prime prime competing in this
year's competition in Las Vegas in

3
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:28,159
August they came in second the condition
runs fall below $1 yeah yeah

4
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:53,149
48 hours lol city maybe this is
competition is a real real challenge in

5
00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:13,110
all competitions this topic has to do it

6
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,189
dispossession spacewalking astronauts
have been forced to a much bigger than

7
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:37,000
that without I'm just say thanks so I
started with a good place for it

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:50,729
decrypt which is really strong password
hashing algorithm and they used the

9
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:59,210
wrong number of terms that means they
have over 4000 iterations and really

10
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:07,619
slow so slow in CPU and GPU on the
example of the GPU

11
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:21,100
a.m. Dr 990 X it would have to look for
four cards of these would have took two

12
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:37,070
days just to attack although 6636
million against one password so it's

13
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,930
really slow sure there are FPGAs which
would speed up the crypt

14
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,660
we don't have access to those so we
looked for different things for

15
00:02:50,660 --> 00:03:02,410
different approach one of us does
anybody know what they're looking to use

16
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:12,100
for it really looks like an md5 hash and
then the source code is open to public

17
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:23,320
then I have to look at it just a
transcript you scrap for locking key

18
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,579
islamic popped up

19
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:35,510
when I first 33 fell off my chair
because that's a horrible thing to do

20
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:46,620
for a couple of things of course and if
I shouldn't be used at least not you to

21
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:57,340
shame passwords and bigger thing i think
is a lowercase the peso before washing

22
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:05,570
it so that reduces the number of
possible characters by 26

23
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:13,040
you don't have a separate case you don't
have to possibility of an uppercase

24
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:30,420
characters in it but sadly this line but
I opened the the php file before the

25
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:39,070
lock and key actually got traded this
was done so what the hell is encrypted

26
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:59,240
password is it actually was a class B
crypt and so it's not encrypted anyway

27
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,789
so we knew that the equipped and the
current structure of the speakership

28
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:23,330
class is around six to 12 which I was
like before or if you look at this

29
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:31,609
you have any chance of getting the
pursuit of the lucky but some of us

30
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:41,710
crazy enough to to just tested and took
to use around these columns and just

31
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:49,849
simple person like 12 21234 I'm because
the results and I was company across

32
00:05:49,849 --> 00:06:04,830
cultures get the reverberations version
control system so I didn't get blamed

33
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:14,508
and find out that encrypted password was
added in the middle of June 2012 which

34
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:28,550
means all passwords were stored in plain
text before another horrible thing to do

35
00:06:28,550 --> 00:07:29,590
they tried to attack them because we
actually found later on there was

36
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:36,739
another refused to generate

37
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:54,690
here called 252 the first one is just
under 5 a.m. I am too was only used if

38
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:02,440
the user updated their profile and also
only username password or human rights

39
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:15,670
got changed so what we did is we have
the whole long table and removed all the

40
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,910
cases because because

41
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,770
we have to pick up trash so we really
have to use in a moment we have to

42
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:37,460
address which are generated all possible
for it to run them against and the five

43
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:50,280
keys so we found out we were left with
14 points 41 44 million locking system

44
00:08:50,280 --> 00:09:04,949
can attack we get a personal fit so we
mostly use them declined for this to to

45
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:28,830
get by if I am terrified I am 231 that
i'm gonna talk about it later we we used

46
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:38,110
for sale has cut to attack the
twenty-fifth cause because just use the

47
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:47,130
username two columns and you thought
assault news to an existing markets

48
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:58,530
already implemented in that scott also
remember creator off and explained to

49
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:12,020
the two cult is about which was used to
because we only got the lower case

50
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,390
that's retarded out of the key

51
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:31,160
so if I kinda like we thought we
invented a new method and later out that

52
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,670
it's already been there in ages

53
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:43,459
director and it's there it's called the
single market for example we have been

54
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,300
username or email arresting her primary
gmail.com and the password country under

55
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:03,910
Prime so what this smoked up stuff is
only attacked the only local keister had

56
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:18,469
this user name and password and we could
simply use a candidate that we kind of

57
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:29,630
guessed the password could be so we also
had contact with the guys from has cut

58
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:37,330
they implemented both of these methods
in 2007 so keep your support and kind

59
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:44,070
enough to give us give us a copy of that
isn't public baths now has cut its open

60
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,420
source so at this yourself

61
00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:02,050
one point when we all have a significant
increase our rules we use another

62
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:17,839
approach to attract more bees so we
called mosque modeling

63
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:34,960
just look at this line we have a length
of Damascus seventy chips it's almost

64
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:46,840
four percent of all the person York you
use this mask and we had so far tracked

65
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:57,940
looking case we only had one point seven
percent of it so we calculated the Delta

66
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:09,370
also politically space all the possible
combinations with this mosque and time

67
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:18,290
in hours to find out which mosque

68
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,490
which mark what would actually be more
efficient struggle against at least

69
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:38,440
first later on we have power and
attractive the mosque that took longer

70
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:50,440
we also attaches directly we tested over
to call the user name of the database

71
00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:03,370
and random against only matching pick up
trash so that he can afford us around

72
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:13,620
three sides by around 600 per 600,000
users use their username and password

73
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:27,800
then we have looked at the demands and
tested already cracked passwords against

74
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:38,939
the same time I'm so there was actually
madison.com in the laptop net factor we

75
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:49,360
also and just slightly modified time
tested that again the president also

76
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,269
gave records results just remove the
numbers or at some basic numbers for

77
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:14,670
example of one point we also tested the
top 30 locking keys that fact that we

78
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:33,089
30 heard this still took a really long
time

79
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:42,060
luckily some of our set 3 CPU power and
could run this for a couple of days so

80
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:52,050
some statistics we tracked but almost
self-priming pump three million and if I

81
00:15:52,050 --> 00:16:09,829
am more than 50,000 into which means of
the fortune that four million possible

82
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:22,640
crack double tracked over 90% of it all
in all we had were 414 half-million

83
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:35,189
Tutsis cracked and validated so that
means to be almost wrecked forty percent

84
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:42,810
of all the taxes in this Ashley Madison
however there were a bit more than

85
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:51,390
200,000 that we couldn't wait five
seconds to be equipped to respond we

86
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,890
still don't know why anybody has some
information about that we like to hear

87
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,189
about it so

88
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:15,530
of course to show only going to show
that top 10 passwords for each of each

89
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:25,430
algorithm used because we certainly
don't want any personal security review

90
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:41,160
person's identity by six what you see
from from any other leaks except for

91
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:54,930
actually that was very specific pursuits
player taught today there are some

92
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:13,290
interesting ones if I fail to and we
believe that was a box suite 100

93
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:22,129
centuries guessing but we will kind of
strong

94
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:32,550
you see you you have to focus lower case
and decrypt should secretary

95
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:41,270
opportunities that can cause older
locking keys used were generated from

96
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,060
the lower tax perspective it

97
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:56,990
so linked think this really surprised
that you actually could use one

98
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:10,010
character passwords I don't know but
there is kind of weird woody see similar

99
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:20,900
to two orders to other leaks like there
were only six points 4 million unique

100
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,420
passwords of it

101
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,680
complexity

102
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:37,690
most used lower and lower case
characters and numbers or just lower

103
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:57,830
case numbers are also commonly used gets
more complex but yeah

104
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:45,500
product and if you really need a link so
I can reset their passwords first use

105
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:57,929
rental generated data and not only thing
actually use it maybe if only if only

106
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:10,789
was 44 like passages that let them
expire after after some time today let

107
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:17,440
someone look at their code because this
one was really easy to find

108
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:26,659
took me less than an hour to figure it
out so so

109
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:36,129
questions and just contact us on Twitter
or email and confirm and expand
