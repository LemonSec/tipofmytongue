1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:12,170
so my name is Taylor spiral and I work
with cyber security company in Sweden

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:20,920
its consulting and I know somewhere
linguistic cracking on the best races

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:29,730
using Markov chains originally this was
mostly just work with my boss Michael

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,610
simple it's so why say but he couldn't
be here today so I will be doing all the

5
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:45,920
talking so we'll start with background
we often hear a recommendation or

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,550
requirements saying a bus which should
be long and complex in order to remember

7
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,519
very long passwords it's basically a
necessary to skip the complex part and

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:09,640
just based on my braces and constantly
increasing requirements on length of

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:19,570
passwords leads to increased use of this
simply thats races available tracking

10
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,669
methods of today are not very efficient
when it there's more than two words

11
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:34,210
included and languages are relatively
predictable and far from random which we

12
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:44,360
should utilize so if we try to crack
only linguistically correct races could

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,780
we find an effective way to crack long
past much and should we or should we let

14
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:58,100
generate this crisis and finally liable
to recommend users to use the past

15
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,250
racism word

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:08,210
this work was a test of concept we are
delimited past races to this definition

17
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:17,820
a longer password which is composed of
two or more words mostly three or more

18
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:27,670
and without white space and we only look
at lower case past races this work the

19
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:37,179
maximum length of 20 characters so
market jane free market process is a

20
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,040
process where translations to other
states are determined by a probability

21
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,940
distribution based on the current state
the sequence of state transitions in the

22
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,730
process of change within the market
chain of order Mr the states are

23
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,660
redefined wait to be able to include can
have a history of em number of states

24
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,799
and one way to do a language wild thing
is to build up

25
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:12,260
phrases from grams together with Marco
change some order and minus one and

26
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:19,709
grounds are sequences with and number of
elements which could be either produce

27
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,600
or words and I'm over it

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:36,569
3444 government so this distinct take a
stick

29
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:45,280
the statistics for the probability
distribution of England's are generated

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,840
from counting number of occurrences of
Ingram's in larger texts from that it

31
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,889
can be later be examined which character
which territories more likely to be to

32
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:08,340
follow a certain sequence of other
chapters about our implementation of

33
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:18,789
market forces are implementation has
linguistically correct places as

34
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:26,740
possible and he does it under fire which
can be used as a word lists in tracking

35
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,330
application for sale in the freezer
storage heater working application with

36
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:39,650
which supports input streams from
standard in if the files are saved and

37
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,729
reused list for future cracking as long
as there is space on your hard drive

38
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:50,840
kind of a time memory trade off so the
actual race generation is split into two

39
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:00,630
phases with one console application for
each first application will take a large

40
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:09,969
text source has launched a stylus input
extract and grounds and generate England

41
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,220
statistics resulted as it saved into a
new tax trial where number of

42
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,289
occurrences or show

43
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:29,099
application and the next face will use
this crime statistics and by going to a

44
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:36,659
market process it will generate a phrase
that would be a Robert phase one

45
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:41,710
occasion has started from the console
and use a special place the textile

46
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,099
let's should be analyzed as well as a
side order and level of the Ingrams

47
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,889
level could be here

48
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:56,050
word level or choke lever the source
file is random process line by Lyon

49
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,110
raining out and counting the Ingrams
some filtering and changes are made for

50
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:08,379
example country punctuation marks are
replaced by a single doctor represent

51
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:15,139
something springs including santa's
breaks makes it possible to select the

52
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:21,529
start of the generate generated racist
by taking into account which grants are

53
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:27,830
more common in the start of sentences
and we can also do the same in the end

54
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,519
of differences to end them in a more
sensible way so intrigued tomorrow and

55
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,990
we also still keep track of white space
which is used in the process as word

56
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,669
breaks even if the final output strips
of white space so when the finest read

57
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:52,318
today and our statistics are saved to a
text file which will be used in the next

58
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,390
face

59
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:04,380
starting the actual priests generation
in place to both lower and upper limit

60
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:14,920
on the length of the generated for Asus
you can also choose if if you want a

61
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:24,260
certain number of words or phrases and
of course you choose to use the program

62
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,969
reads damn statistics finance or 10
rounds in the list of states of Science

63
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,410
and minus one where every state test
subjects of the possible next character

64
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:44,060
forward sorted by number of occurrences
in the source text example shows a small

65
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,540
extract from the list of statistics
where the states on the left

66
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,210
consists of three characters and those
lists to write a sorted according to the

67
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:02,440
number of occurrences and what source
texts so distorting states which begin

68
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,580
with a dot or loaded into separate lists
to which which is also sold according to

69
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:16,090
the number of occurrences you can also
choose to set the threshold

70
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,539
grounds that don't have higher
occurrence than this well you will be

71
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:31,240
ignored so there would be no generator
traces containing those grounds for each

72
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,280
starting say it's a tough one at a time
using a recursive function that goes

73
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,990
through all possibilities in order
according to this England statistics now

74
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,930
I will try to describe our goal this and
which well yes we need to calculate to

75
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,120
determine if we have achieved that goal

76
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,029
so there are different estimates are
media complexity around to be over the

77
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,430
English language some estimates are
based on your guesses where you already

78
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:16,229
know about earlier letters have a
perfect model of the language and this

79
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,270
has adopted their interpretation of
entropy is slightly towards sweats

80
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:31,600
context so we will be using their
interpretation of us our target they

81
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,570
assigned a different story different
characters in the text of the first

82
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:45,390
assigned for bits and subsequent
character that has signed and to be as

83
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,860
low as an example for 16 charter phrase

84
00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:02,000
30 beats password 16 totally random
characters I seventy-five bits which

85
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,200
means it should be 40 trillion times
easier to get a correct English race of

86
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:17,650
this Lynx shares chosen for the earlier
show me who will compare our values

87
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,439
against us we get from the next to a
local calculating interpret and we call

88
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,779
this target on to be there for each
raised list we generate we calculate how

89
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,260
large and print this list potentially
could have only based on how many places

90
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,880
it contains we call this potential
history if the craziest has a lower

91
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,889
potential is empty

92
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,350
than the toilet and to be it means it
probably contains too few phrases and

93
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,069
there's there are more phrases in the
English language

94
00:10:54,069 --> 00:11:02,628
racist if it's higher than the number of
generated racers in is enough to cover

95
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:11,429
it covering the language but it doesn't
mean they are linguistically correct so

96
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:17,189
to make an estimate on how correct the
phrases in the list are we calculate the

97
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:24,689
officials and officials say after a
successful attempt by dividing the

98
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:30,480
number of correct ashes by the number of
sort of shit with this efficiency and

99
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,689
the total number of racism list with a
calculator estimated and repair of the

100
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:42,559
phrase fighting so for example if a for
the password to attract the estimated to

101
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:58,079
be become one of them if you were
correct so finally some results but they

102
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,128
are testing samples were degraded from
Tobias some of my colleagues at

103
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:09,299
consulting for herself

104
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:19,160
ten past races from you tryin and I got
him I received 66 hashers the best way

105
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,480
to themselves so I had no idea what the
password is where only thing and over

106
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:34,289
force how many of each link that was
angry and statistics were created from

107
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:42,319
three different source this to get some
variety on the underlying language and

108
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:48,529
see the fact that the one source most
used was 21 from the news

109
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:57,160
source says it was just with three
million synthesis and very able to use

110
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,740
to generate the phrase list can be
derived from the finalists chosen in

111
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:13,769
results lead just a file named like this
it means lol and 20 means that the

112
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,809
length of the racist or 20 characters
long

113
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:25,660
W six mins away six words these races g5
means the threshold is certified and

114
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,719
three means

115
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,670
43 was used

116
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:40,599
wo means that the English were at world
level and news means that the source

117
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,490
takes was the one from the new sites so
here are the results from a few

118
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,300
different attempts we start by looking
at the phrase that would link at the top

119
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:00,170
here may be interesting to note the
difference in numbers generated for Asus

120
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:09,969
between the child to level the word
level the first contract 70 15 harshest

121
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:21,180
which is a pretty good result but
because of the potential there was a

122
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:29,709
large compared to target on to pay the
estimated and repair

123
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,949
became hi

124
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,960
also interesting is that despite the
change in the threshold value at world

125
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:52,630
level 2 923 him on the phone with no
threshold they both practicing number of

126
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:59,630
purchase that makes the estimated to be
larger for the fun continued more

127
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:15,740
phrases meaning that it was 14 raises
based on a five-run character level was

128
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:26,510
not able to crack and harshest but when
it grounds were used to lower level

129
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,670
finance cracked two other harshest
switch between them was the same so the

130
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:43,040
two totally totally unique challenges
cracked that phrase 14 was right lanes

131
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,040
16 the criterion tips on the test
samples were that differences should

132
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,219
consist of 426 words so the files we're
restricted to that and that

133
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,130
unfortunately means that the target
entrepreneurial match exactly and it's

134
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,910
actually a slightly lower than 30 years
if i dont divided into groups with

135
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:16,569
different number of words per phrase in
order to limit devices so it alliance

136
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,170
with the Sunstone most interesting in
your apt

137
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:33,269
group grows so too was the best talent
in the terms of six word final result

138
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:39,440
drastically we also compare different
take sources of the world level of

139
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:57,339
racists containing five words just
broken these two files were dif we chose

140
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:03,279
to choice of source text is clearly
influencing in total there were six

141
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:14,900
unique those races corrective lens 1620
races started to hang get extremely long

142
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,689
and none of the first two fights were
able to correct it and it but when we

143
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,809
let the phrase generation work through
I'll be fine go to results on twenty

144
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:35,470
charity phrases to as well but I'm to
line shows just as successful results

145
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:42,830
and let the phrase generation two weeks
to complete

146
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,490
thats

147
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:56,140
the potential and trapeze and lower than
the Toyota which indicates that despite

148
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,640
the longer duration times they were
still too few for Asus to cover the

149
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:09,740
English language so the total number of
crack 2012 races where to this chart

150
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,679
shows the different and rebellious from
the table in the previous slide to get a

151
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,660
better overview the goal is that the
borrower

152
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:25,590
estimated time to be in a dark blue to
be as low as possible but not lower than

153
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:33,340
the bar of the target and to be like all
three boys should be equal as possible

154
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:42,439
and keep in mind that this is a to log
scale so one unit corresponds to it

155
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,740
doubled increase you can see here where
they were mentioned in the last line

156
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:55,380
that the most effective attempt was the
group two of the phrase things 16 that

157
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:03,059
word level because there is no other
publicly available

158
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:13,510
effective tracking attack on these links
as racist the phrase lists estimated and

159
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,890
repairs are here compared to brute-force
attack you and nothing is more effective

160
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:26,270
than brute force of course but the
question is how much so this is also to

161
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:36,389
logarithmic scale so one better grace
means double their efficiency this works

162
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:42,240
method of correcting although it can be
further developed and optimized it's far

163
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,700
more efficient than the brute force

164
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:54,480
and we also did a test against real-life
passwords on the LinkedIn leaked this

165
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,620
was done using only our previously
created list with the same phrase think

166
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:07,799
tanks and with some help from the
password steps from doctors because we

167
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:13,918
estimated the number of lowercase
password which length and our method

168
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,580
seems to a generally correct about
percent of this target scope but even

169
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:29,120
that target scope several passwords are
included I still are not linguistically

170
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:38,350
correct prices which was the target of
our work so probably this it's better

171
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:46,439
for us so that we succeed in cracking
that many places should be seen as a

172
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,220
good result and compared to brute-force
it's of course superior in terms of

173
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,399
entry to reach the target entropy was
not really achieved but even so it feels

174
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:05,268
like the market model is pretty
effective language for them to crack

175
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:13,559
ship has been elected other matters if
you look at what type of underground

176
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:20,230
source most effective it was three
rounds on the word level despite the

177
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:29,139
world level four aces to generate and
all things considered if you use past

178
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:34,029
racist he should at least be longer than
print characters and character sets

179
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:38,090
should be used

180
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:45,110
this work was just a test of concept and
method and implementation could be

181
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:53,139
improved a lot for example performance
optimizations limitation or possible and

182
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,730
desirable and including other character
sets are necessary for use in real

183
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,620
situations improving improvements in
their career them as like the phrase

184
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,830
generation order is also possible to
make it more effective so if you want

185
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:21,039
more info through email or visitor
company website they will soon be

186
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,330
engaging content about this work and the
new sort of blog section and call will

187
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,710
also be released as open source on
SourceForge soon if you want to get a

188
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,580
copy or contribute to coat
