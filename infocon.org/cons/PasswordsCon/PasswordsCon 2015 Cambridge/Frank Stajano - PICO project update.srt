1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,870
say to people that I want to eliminate
crossroads minors harassment because

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,240
start not danny and I don't have to
explain to this audience that passwords

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,690
are impossible to use property because
security celebrity Mikko Hypponen has

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,450
collected this tweet which is a cynical
caricature think of something can't

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:28,240
remember and then don't write it down so
besides his ability but it's also have

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,278
very poor security as many other
presentations at this conference and

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,180
demonstrate I i assembled a team that
wrote this question paper widely sided

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,790
paper on evaluating alternative systems
to basra its alternatives such as for

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,170
example biometrics which are convenient

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,239
replacement for my smartphone but they
can't be revoked

11
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,370
they can be used across a network and in
an unsupervised fashion and they are not

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,120
grievous friend what about the graphical
passwords graphical passwords leverage

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,270
our visual memory but no memory based
system can never escape to hundreds of

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,340
accounts so if the proponents of any
system these memory-based say that you

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,560
should only be used for a master
password then the rest is does it some

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,249
kind of single sign-on system then
they're not selling a product link

17
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:22,869
between the single sign-on system single
sign-on systems are great but if they

18
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:24,049
are in the cloud

19
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,639
then like a facebook connect their stuff
that's been mentioned by truancy because

20
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:33,130
they're seeing as I don't operate there
is necessary aware of when and to whom

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,939
you ever event tickets so a single
sign-on system could also be local if

22
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:42,068
you want plus convenience and privacy so
that these under your control like a

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,429
local Barcelona just for example and
this is why we develop eco which

24
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,319
essentially manager or single sign-on
system which lives in your pocket is

25
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,279
designed to be previously protecting and
supporting both usability and security

26
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,940
its central design criteria you should
not have to

27
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,789
remember any secrets in order to
authenticate not even just a master one

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,840
so there's a video on our web page from
2013 that some of you may have already

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,430
seen in this new video from 2015 here's
our house our current smartphone

30
00:02:14,430 --> 00:08:50,970
smartphone days prototype of these when
feeding replacing web passwords

31
00:08:50,970 --> 00:09:02,110
secure passwords and we succeeded
compared to the kind of us are that

32
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:10,079
recommended which is this however the
trouble is that bouncer that people

33
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:19,199
actually use 12345678 like haiku at the
ABC want to see which I hear basically

34
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:24,089
for any technology you have a slider
where you can choose to trade off

35
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,399
usability and security we want to move
to a different country which is better

36
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,329
in both more usable and more secure six
further along this way in this chart of

37
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,329
usability and security however it from
here you go all the way through this

38
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,670
light of the world security and have
pathetic so all the way to his ability

39
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,849
and basically zero security then
although we have made the improvement we

40
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,699
cannot be as usable as something like
that can 123456 it's harder for any

41
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,660
technology to be any more secure than
that so we have encountered a lot of

42
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,389
shots about adopting people and why
that's because our prototype I must

43
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,370
admit doesn't yet so an actual problem
because although most of the academic

44
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,800
literature these we do whether it's the
truth is that it's not where the pain is

45
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,709
anymore

46
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,069
the big web sites like Facebook has more
he said

47
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:24,599
want you to stay logged in all the time
and therefore they send your long legs

48
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,100
cookie you never have to type the
password except for the first time

49
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,009
your web browser remembers it possible
for you automatically so there's no pain

50
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,069
there either except maybe if you log in
again from a different browser and he

51
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:42,360
threw that peco offers greater security
than longley cookies or password

52
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,800
managers that are in in the company's
computer but is it don't give a damn

53
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,199
about security so I know so they don't
want to have any responsibility for

54
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,949
security to dump this problem on to
someone else so we got hope to attract

55
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:59,809
users to Pico for its security features
and people would only be a success if

56
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:00,439
it's a dress

57
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:07,300
a perceived pain that people and web
browsers where the pain is so we don't

58
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,109
have been working on computer again as
opposed to merely web looking because

59
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,150
they're gonna be rescued by Google +1
rises before you you are even inside and

60
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,170
there is undeniable pain especially if
you are in a corporate environment that

61
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,670
mandates some screen lock up to 10
minutes of inactivity Jonathan milliken

62
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,040
from facebook is a hearing the audience
is ready to go hide on offense when he

63
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,199
was nice to see and hear the prototype
unix-like game and green jacket in my

64
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,530
car right here he's he's the local
organizer of the conference is arranging

65
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,300
for lunch to happen he's been developing
discover there and integrating it with

66
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,959
our continuous authentication facility
and another former faculty member max

67
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,490
Spencer was over here you gotta a
Windows prototype which is shown in the

68
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,190
next to you this is a very primitive
mind you and is it requires more must

69
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,410
extend we would actually like what it
demonstrates how you can log into your

70
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,800
Windows machine is a blessing in
disguise

71
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,780
not to let side without having to
remember or type it possible that it

72
00:12:09,780 --> 00:14:07,560
also features continuous integration

73
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:20,520
used on more than just computers and
unlock the Internet of Things and the

74
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,410
grandest Alex down glacial might believe
you in the audience of an area as well

75
00:14:24,410 --> 00:19:01,330
and Agnes camera I don't think is
internally

76
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:29,110
my associate with a little doors that
open I just kinda peak when depending on

77
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,010
your level of authorization you may or
may not be able to open the nuclear

78
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:40,870
reactor door david also has another
poster and I see also has one of the

79
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,709
reasons why people may not want to
abandon gossipers even if you provide

80
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,070
the newer technology is because if I so
it can be given to someone else even if

81
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,780
the rules are you from doing that and a
parent may give a paean to their

82
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,570
teenager to tell them to go and buy some
groceries anything new and more secure

83
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,950
system preventing these kind of music
that people do find convenient that he

84
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,870
would not actually be welcomed

85
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,899
so we are also exploring ways that we
can offer a delegation and you have a

86
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,120
different architecture options depending
on whether the very fire operates on

87
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
whether doing behind his back doing it
in a transparent way the disadvantage of

88
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,940
telling someone else your password is of
course that it's hard to limit the

89
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,860
rights that you are granting to the
other person or to revoke them if the

90
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,699
delegate emits behaves they don't even
lock you out of your account will be

91
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,900
great said he wanted to be at the
delegate use the bank card for example

92
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,600
only for that afternoon are only for
spending thirty pounds on and this is

93
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,699
what david has been working on now in
their interests of leaving some time for

94
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,650
questions I'm just going to close here
the goal of people is to liberate

95
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,020
humanity from fossils and they're good
usability reasons for doing so good

96
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,590
security reasons for doing so they're
good business reasons even in terms of

97
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,810
improved satisfaction and productivity
we are pleased but ultimately for me

98
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,190
it's a moral imperative

99
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,190
because we computer people have this
amazing super power of being able to

100
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,750
define the laws of physics of the
digital society so it's believed to make

101
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,919
it fair for everyone else and we talked
about giving people an impossible task

102
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,659
and then blaming that if they failed to
accomplish it which i think is morally

103
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,570
wrong and I have pledged that people
will remain pageantry and royalty free

104
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:29,289
because I want to put no barriers to
adoption and have it spread as wide as

105
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:34,070
possible I think I thank all the past
and present members of my people team

106
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,850
stuff and it brought us where we are
today I think my PC dushanbe University

107
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,719
of Cambridge the European Research
Council who have generously message

108
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,210
after a very competitive selection
process thank you very much
