1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:16,200
from his yet experienced University
referee

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:27,880
so this is work did with somebody who's
Angela who are believes given their

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,320
keynote tomorrow so people have to use
passwords in organizations but there's

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,820
also these things called help desks this
maybe you bring up the helpdesk they

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,110
help you all you go to this this help
desk hidden away somewhere some tiny

6
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,350
desk and they help you there this AM and
help desk or the the thing that's

7
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,100
popular in a minute to try and keep the
cost down is that some website on the

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,850
internet or something like that you go
to and you told yourself and so as has

9
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,260
been said in a few the talks there's his
password policies in organizations that

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,540
you have to abide by they can be
unusable and with that they can be

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,440
insecure 441 these passwords can be
forgotten but also people may has been

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,560
said earlier they can develop these
strategies for for being able to use

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,190
passwords they they write them down you
might lose the north and so what we were

14
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,870
interested in is this help desks so that
they know that they're doing a good job

15
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,840
they keep logs this also lets them know
what's happening so they can record the

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,940
support requests from people people
turning up people ringing of people

17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,310
doing things with the self service to
help the logs track these individual

18
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:52,260
password changes as well but loads do
not capture the impact upon end user

19
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,020
productivity it's something I look
successful but we don't know what people

20
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,890
have gone through to get

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,730
and also system managers are not
incentivize and what happens is the the

22
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,240
users are left to just go with it

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,540
as I said coping strategies and the like
what we did exploratory analysis of a

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,280
university's helpdesk load data this
month thirty months its thousands of

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,370
registered staff and students
half-a-billion system events what we

26
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,120
were looking out with monthly tallies
over those thirty months the analysis

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,620
informed some follow-on exploratory
interviews that's a small sample oh

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,000
twenty students even with this we're
able to begin to uncover issues under

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,650
represented in the locks so the systems
that will logs though under observation

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,450
there is this past their personal
password management system that's as I

31
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,238
said this this site of the you go to you
it's assumed you know your password and

32
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,450
unserved and then you're into your new
one and you change your password and

33
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,630
assistant doesn't leave you alone it
send you a reminder emails over a period

34
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,269
of time and it was sending a few more to
you if you if you ignore the first one

35
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:18,310
look nobody does that then there is this
password expiry but then there's also a

36
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,519
in the system we observed this is grace
period after expiry where you can still

37
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,510
reset your password but then also
there's this extra system people may

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,989
forget their password and so there is
this personal password recovery system

39
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,739
to complicate things further you then
have your own memorable phrases and

40
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:45,709
hence you record in this in this
university when you join us when you

41
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,829
register for the system so that's a
phrase and then some hints for the

42
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,280
fridge

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,180
employed export data analysis to explore
what the locus could show of the user

44
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,010
experience already it may be that the
Stinson their of the kind of experiences

45
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,299
people how the unsuccessful or
successful reset or recover all

46
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,330
passwords the CDA informed interview
questions that's nine open-ended

47
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,850
questions based on what was happening in
the logs on what was not seen in the

48
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,419
logs and experiences of using these
systems and the attitudes towards the

49
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,510
password policy that people up these
students have to use the idea being that

50
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,240
we analyze these interviews with some
holistic thinking believe this user

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,600
experience to the numbers and figure out
this something that can be added to this

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,030
logging process or to the support
process to make it a little bit easier

53
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:51,789
for people across the bottom percentage
of users going to the side so the green

54
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,700
is everything is great you reset your
password

55
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,560
within your within your window the blue
of the bottom is changing the password

56
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,080
within the grace period so it's kind of
consistent there and then there's this

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,590
in the amber is password change using
this recovery systems that's where you

58
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,270
forgot your password and you have to
then fall back to these these memorable

59
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,469
answers and then in the red is going to
the help desk I guess symbolically

60
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,770
that's in the road because organizations
as I said they'd try and keep the cost

61
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:36,840
down until they can encourage you to do
do it all yourself

62
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:55,669
what's interesting already for instance
there are these people have this

63
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:01,570
recovery system after the summer and
they forgot their passwords but then

64
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,919
that again trying to explore what the
reflection of what's actually happening

65
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,349
it's

66
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,639
is that is that people creating
passwords as they join in then

67
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:22,050
forgetting them straight away and on
first glance this disintegrate is using

68
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,840
the recovery system in the green is how
secure the percentage of people who are

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,359
successful at doing it in the road is
abortion people who are failing at

70
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:44,770
remembering the memorable answers

71
00:06:44,770 --> 00:07:00,030
so what this is within a 24 hour period
of people are trying to recall their

72
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,299
number one memorable answer thing trying
to call again and then trying to call

73
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:13,919
again is it that the pain of recording
of your memorable and C is that

74
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,710
consistent everybody or or perhaps is
there a proportion of people who are

75
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:25,099
failing at that more than everybody
else's but what we see is people try

76
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,940
once and then and are now underway and
what we're interested in here is where

77
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,229
trucks on 23 attempts that's where
things get locked out what was happening

78
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:40,810
to people are they are they are they
going around and looking for this recall

79
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,979
laid-off written down somewhere I'll
don't find that should I should be doing

80
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,008
my work but it's gonna find it or are
they going to the help desk they know

81
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,819
there's a help desk we heard anecdotes
of students turning up to the help desk

82
00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:00,370
in tears so who knows what kind of
journey they feed on charter gonna get

83
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,349
all of their password before things have
been fixed but what's interesting is it

84
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,870
tails off to something which you may
assume is something automated one thing

85
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,319
is what was the noise of trying to use
the system if someone's trying and

86
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,300
trying and trying how far do you go
along here where we're identifying

87
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,090
people who don't know that the helpdesk
is there they think we all need our only

88
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,169
chance is to stay up all day trying to
remember what my memorable answer is

89
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,949
because as we said before the questions
the last bus stop was people may send

90
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:40,470
their number of allowances years ago
when they were trying to call them

91
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,070
there was lots of lots of food for
thought for these interviews that

92
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,410
followed this twenty participants
students are participating University 16

93
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,230
women for four men mean age of 25

94
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,910
twenty-minute individual interviews
which we transcribed and analyzed so

95
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,270
there was this difficulty in meeting the
criteria for seventeen of the 20 like

96
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,569
trial and error go again remember it's
got this through and not rule ok I'll

97
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,790
try prosecute oh no it's telling me that
they saw the rule so it's almost like a

98
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,890
challenge to to remember all the rules
let alone remember your password and

99
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:29,630
then the these difficulties than an
obvious from the laws and I said if

100
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,030
people are trying then it's distracting
them from something else and for

101
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,839
thirteen of the participants the
password reset it felt like it was too

102
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,520
frequently they were they just had a
possible just to get used to it and it

103
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,560
feels like they're going to do it all
again

104
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,869
interestingly 74 there was seven
participants thought was insufficient

105
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:04,060
feedback during this this research felt
like a bit of a guessing game and there

106
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,359
was this feeling that there was a lack
of clear reasoning of what they're doing

107
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,750
all this so there's peace 15 saying I
mean if there are any pertinent security

108
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,440
reasons for having changes but you
better explain it for non-technical

109
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,740
users which is interesting feeling angry
because I have to change its often if I

110
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,870
haven't understood why implying that if
he understood why they may not be so

111
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,080
angry about it

112
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,210
and what's interesting with if back on
the slide where everyone's residing in

113
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,770
the green and everything looks fine

114
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,640
18 participants research before the
deadline but for five of these these

115
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,510
these students it was because the
reminders they get them inside some of

116
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,819
its an application it's telling me
things are going to expire but then

117
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,740
there was three of three students who
thought these reminders that they're

118
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,200
really useful helps me are not my life
in order to get the same man i reset my

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,490
password so the costs to the individual
that there may be different role of

120
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:18,770
those supposedly successful people
successful users interestingly in

121
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,699
contrast to the numbers we saw before
eight milliliters five of our

122
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,130
participants had use this recovery
system but it ought to be

123
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,400
straightforward and what was almost
three years heard of it but not

124
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,480
registered on the restroom just unaware
it even existed so again it's if if they

125
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,810
forget their password is is there this
kind of panic about what to do it's it's

126
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,449
not just a strategy of managing your
passwords but knowing what the support

127
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,950
channels are as well and feeling that
those channels do support but when

128
00:11:51,950 --> 00:12:00,470
people do go to the help desk it's it's
quick and it's quick

129
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:07,020
again something that isn't shown in the
Big Green successful motion of abuses of

130
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,350
our our twenty interviewees there was
this cut down the middle of I get my

131
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,690
email the email saying change your
password

132
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:23,150
neighbor then although the expiry date
and the piece is conscious strategies

133
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:32,579
are not seeing them in in the laws and
then back to the the talk this morning

134
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,750
about these are coping strategies that
experts have 12 of our participants they

135
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,050
talked about these strategies they have
for creating possible that both the

136
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,750
rules but also easy to remember and it
may be sequential changes to some kind

137
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:55,530
of phrase or what we saw was also kind
of list of words in some native language

138
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:01,180
or even city names village names in
someone's native country and try and

139
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,890
change that

140
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,569
into some phrase that's acceptable and
six of our participants wrote these

141
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,640
passwords down what's interesting here
for the the system means is if people

142
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,460
having to create these essentially
offline recall aides recall aids that

143
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,570
they can't see that they then require
the commitment of resources to be able

144
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:32,220
to monitor what people are doing react
respond to two things that people might

145
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,240
be doing in order to maintain security
and then

146
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,510
risk understanding situation situation
awareness was mentioned earlier today

147
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:49,510
seventies students felt a sense of
community to security breaches and

148
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,589
didn't comprehend the security has
mandated open book 10 acknowledged the

149
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,510
need for security despite feeling that
was that it was a pain almost like I'm

150
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,819
part of this institution there is some
personal security responsibility I'm ok

151
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,630
with it but it just gets annoying it's
like both sides anyways I find it

152
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:21,050
annoying but I understand that it has to
be done in terms of students that we

153
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,930
were talking to nine of the participants
believe the University took security

154
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,029
very seriously there's a reset your
password is this all these rules

155
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:40,070
hunt they took this into their other
habits it's an earlier talks was this

156
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:48,540
was their most complex pass would so it
was easier to copy that 20 counts that

157
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,199
were in a secure and also a feeling well
this this is the definition of security

158
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,910
surely follow all the stringency and I
can take us somewhere else and know that

159
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,810
that's a secure password so it kinda
insurance system perhaps not just there

160
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:12,219
at the University but when they go on
into inter Korea's afterwards

161
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,840
so with all of the goal was to to look
at these these user experiences and

162
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,070
consider what could be done today sixty
existing processes so what we had

163
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,610
suggested was that users are provided
with some real time feedback during past

164
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,620
week creation again earlier today I
think it was suggested that the policies

165
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,270
transpiring and you you let people know
what the rules are this may reduce the

166
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,260
number of attempts at creating a
password

167
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,670
the frustration levels and the time to
create a password so even though it

168
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,979
looks successful in the logs that as I
said right the star it's not simply a

169
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,770
case of his ticket someone's reset their
password that too will leave them alone

170
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,780
it's how is this how is this happening
over time what's the effect on the

171
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:05,610
population over time so we'd like to
make it easier for people and also to

172
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:11,000
revisit the communication and
justification of password policies so

173
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,840
the risk understanding as well

174
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,410
explicitly related to potential threats
to the activities of people how so there

175
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,490
was there was one of 23 saying well my
password then you can see my lecture

176
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:35,960
timetable go to my lectures if you want
but then giving these results back to

177
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,770
the help desk managers there were people
want emails being sent from their

178
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:47,949
accounts relate that to what people are
doing and ultimately don't assume that

179
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,480
policies are usable if the majority of
users armed seeking help desk support

180
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,980
resolve this or is this kind of silent
development of coping strategies going

181
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,980
on

182
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:12,440
exploration of the issues but we
certainly want to do more interviews

183
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,540
with users students but also staff and
surveys as well

184
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,869
the interview capture the range of
issues on and structured surveys will

185
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,919
follow to every show a wide user base
that's especially interesting for us in

186
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,850
terms of the contrast between the
student interview experience of this

187
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:45,689
recovery system and what we were seeing
in in those those lawyers also the user

188
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,270
experience in their habits and points of
frustration but it was a lot of data

189
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:57,139
going over lots of years so it would be
great would be to identify some stable

190
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,310
metrics that could then be followed into
the future for

191
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,679
for this effort that people are going
through and for the impact on people who

192
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,660
wear this but there's the effort and the
impact potentially of hidden costs for

193
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,780
security managers if looking closely at
the sort of the scale of the

194
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,879
participating unity there is if the
potential losses to a security incident

195
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,430
are lower than the potential losses of
who knows how many people not being able

196
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:35,309
to do their work that's something to
consider

197
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:36,580
home now
