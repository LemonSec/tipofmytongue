about wrapping up the kids are showing

signs of cybersecurity she has Chris
psychology

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:43,160
security in this paper we haven't found
citations users we look forward to

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,819
hearing from thank you very much thank
you what I want to talk to you today

5
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:57,850
about is you this hate passwords so
they're on their way out meaning how

6
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:06,500
many more classes conferences has nice
hair fine country said

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,560
being looking looking at how swift and
the problems with passwords for nearly

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:24,280
20 years the first time I conducted with
my PhD student at Adams voice in the big

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,479
telecommunications company it's no
secret that bus bTW I dotted with a

10
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,010
phone call I was working on I was
working as a usability past but I'm

11
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,800
something completely different

12
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,929
the first generation of Internet audio
and video tools from actually Batman

13
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:52,700
collaborating with telcos bTW and so
they set you know from usability right I

14
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,950
said yes he said maybe you can help us
with this problem said what's the

15
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:06,720
problem he said the accountants have
stopped to complain about the cost of

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,780
the help this for resetting passwords
they travel the country number of people

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,160
they employ on the helpdesk have trouble
every year for the last three years and

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,160
the accountants as saying the skunk you
gotta stop do something and bad day of

19
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,959
doing something was asked me to run a
quick study and the brief for the

20
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,310
statute literally was peace do quick
study and tell us why these stupid fuses

21
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:47,390
comp remember that possible that's how I
got into this whole thing so when we did

22
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,619
the study and looked at it the answer
actually was very simple it didn't take

23
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,820
us fired on to find out if they they are
not stupid to Euro asking them to do

24
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,090
something that's not humanly possible
people contact between sixty it wasn't

25
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:13,620
this this particular study 6964
different passwords or pens six-digit

26
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,600
pens that changed on a monthly basis

27
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,410
us and you're telling them that come
from the same I'm back on track them

28
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,350
down and read it but it's just not
possible human memory isn't built but I

29
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,519
would like to think that but since about
that particular inside we have come

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,390
along a bit and nobody is asking is
putting people into a situation where

31
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:45,750
they have to do something like that but
I'm not sure that in some situations so

32
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:54,230
generally possible expiry house has been
extended a little birds are very few

33
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,489
places you six digit pins because that's
the hard way that that doesn't work

34
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:05,300
actually we found that that almost 10 a
bit more than 10 years when when we

35
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,730
looked at it is so the one thing that of
course significantly changed since the

36
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,220
introduction of that paper was since I
paper was the introduction of a single

37
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,339
sign-on so that rapidly first thing
applying on and standardization of use

38
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:27,010
arising out of use IDs with that the
problem got whittled down crimes quite a

39
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,760
bit but even when we looked even in
organizations that have single plan on

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,380
people still have between seven and
eight passwords six straight passwords

41
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,730
they had to use regularly and that was
still complaining about the time they

42
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,650
have to spend on on entering passwords
is a significant drain on productivity

43
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:54,780
and that that's how it it was disrupting
them and the other doesn't stop other

44
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,469
colleagues since produced what procured
was also that people that people who

45
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:07,260
uses 3d try to help themselves in the
way by using reusing pots with across

46
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,599
multiple accounts memo sconce with get
recycled and using more than one way for

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,610
people do that in order to increase the
frequency of use to make sure they as a

48
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,970
way of trying to help them remember
these these passports better and that is

49
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,720
from my memory point of view

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,590
sensible strategy but from a security
point of view that's becoming

51
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:35,250
increasingly less understandable because
of the way that it took us work I'll

52
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,240
come back to that nato I'm to stay on
the on the track is a few years ago with

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,440
american colleagues funded by NIST we do
this study where we looked we took the

54
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:56,840
time to to to use the technique reef we
used in various organizations before 22

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,669
basically asked people to keep diaries
of all the authentication that have to

56
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,680
make amends used as a starting point to
talk through people with all the kinds

57
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,760
of things that happened and why not the
one of the things that we had previously

58
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,580
observed that the amount of time people
spend just authenticating in the course

59
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,919
of a day and dealing with all the
recovery that's associated when people

60
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,830
forget it hospice once you add that
really is significant time and effort in

61
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,479
this study we study started to realize
there are actually some additional

62
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:40,419
effects that we haven't understood
before so the disruption of the primary

63
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:48,169
task was something we had previously not
really factor into the effort that's

64
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,789
that's basically that individuals you
individual users use but also if these

65
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,600
people

66
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,530
employees in the company and they they
they do this in the cost of that work

67
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,840
this is also time the company uses and
this is so he probably can appreciate

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,080
people need to authenticate to look into
various systems but that's not their

69
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,300
main job they have a main job to do and
when authentication disrupts the primary

70
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,720
activity that we do

71
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,810
I'm still in this study we have actually
appreciate it even there as a

72
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:29,710
psychologist you might / 525 amendment
my psychology from from undergraduate

73
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,400
school is when somebody interrupts you
at the point when you do your main task

74
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,710
you come just go and resume immediately
at the point where you got disrupted

75
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,810
what you need to do and where was I and
you basically mentally

76
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,110
expected short-term memory and going
trying to remember where you were before

77
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,890
that the longer the interruption that
was associated with the authentication

78
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,940
task takes the longer that probe I guess
and what we've discovered in the new

79
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,969
study was that people have to redo about
40% off the work that has already spent

80
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,130
on the primary task before they could
get back to carrying on with it now

81
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:20,390
friend you when that time onto the time
that people are just finding all the

82
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,780
figures become truly staggering so I
previously when I've talked about this i

83
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,880
seven companies are studied people spend
up to 30 minutes a day with

84
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,240
authentication we like to ask if you go
to the management of a company and say

85
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:45,230
do you realize that day that's three
weeks time just logging in right you

86
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:51,820
suddenly go back a huge part of the
productivity budget and then they're

87
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,850
suddenly become a bit more interested in
seeing like well maybe we should look at

88
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:02,160
the way I was stopped authenticated
systems maybe we should make this easy

89
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,339
and should make it less disruptive for
them so to get rid of what we called in

90
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,450
in this new study the wall of disruption
so what sort of one of the design

91
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,150
decisions that I think previously the
people to deploy this mechanism have

92
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,139
never really thought about is that often
you have flexibility about where

93
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:29,689
the authentication occurs and so the
same enough indication of the same

94
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:37,079
workload placed somewhere placed in
between two tasks were disrupted top is

95
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:42,738
significantly less for the user then
disrupting in the middle of a task when

96
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:49,040
you then need to get back and reducing
so this idea that that we can put you in

97
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,868
future when we look at designing better
more seamless authentication

98
00:09:52,869 --> 00:10:00,309
authentication task so in this to come
back to the type of the toll the

99
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,389
participants in our study basically we
asked them to to sort the various the

100
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:12,049
various things they they mentioned about
90 cases and then with this hate list

101
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:17,889
from Aunt and number one on this heinous
and what you start to realize it's not

102
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:23,519
just necessarily the password and the
authentication itself it's the

103
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,709
combination with other security measures
that the company puts in place that is

104
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:29,569
causing this

105
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:35,219
so in this organisation right on top was
in the repeated authentication to the

106
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,939
same systems so this particular company
had a fifteen-minute timeouts if you

107
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,089
hadn't touched the keyboard off one of
your system for 15 minutes it will lock

108
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,949
the screen and you have to be
authenticated again and it was

109
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:53,219
particularly bad if you were in within
the perimeter of the organization if you

110
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,040
were working from home while you are
traveling you not only had two eccentric

111
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,860
821 system began you basically have to
decrypt yet to get back into the machine

112
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,669
then you have to authenticate to the VPN
and that your head to Santa k to the

113
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:11,470
application using my and so you can see
you know why people get going to go

114
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,850
stocks it to get quite frustrated here
you know and they would basically say

115
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,900
like that

116
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,870
very often it is for all knowledge
workers quite you know people people who

117
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,970
are you know most of them were the very
technical background of this website you

118
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,110
for 15 minutes and using two systems I'm
reading a specification on one system

119
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:39,250
programming on the system so you moving
thing but haven't moved for two hours 50

120
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,050
minutes I still have to prove to this is
that it's neat

121
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,740
this is like pounding the table the
train now aim to use and saying for god

122
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:58,780
sake technology should be small tub and
it shouldn't do this to me the night of

123
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,680
the 21 is mine that goes right back to
use a song not the enemy it's something

124
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,630
that we pointed out in there is the
possibility that you using several times

125
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:14,140
today not the main problem there is
possible that only a problem when they

126
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,949
friends you have when you change them in
in the days following the change in one

127
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,540
sec 'cause regular problems are the ones
that people don't use frequently so this

128
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,569
is basically a maybe only a couple of
times a month and in some cases we've

129
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,240
had we've had people you know that this
often systems may be that the proud

130
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,400
child services that people only used
twice a year

131
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,540
chance you can you can remember you you
can remember that if you've got multiple

132
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,660
systems I'm prospects require secretly
people literally run out of ideas

133
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,079
because a lot of things this is to
decide that you have a possible check

134
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,210
her that back kicks in

135
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,120
you have a history mechanism in my
organization

136
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,020
history mechanism even picks up if you
only try and change one character of the

137
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,770
password when you change and telling you
I'm sorry this sucks I bake and Krypton

138
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:26,730
a pic character basis depending yes some
people house yes fashion salt would be

139
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,200
the proper way to the yeah not too which
not everyone does if you've ever listen

140
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:41,779
to Kamakura least recent yeah you wish a
lot of them done so by creating about

141
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,130
possible experience that the use them
have asked this is just got no no no no

142
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,600
and it's not unusual we've watched in
our studies people sit there for 15

143
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,660
minutes 20 minutes trying to come up
with a violent past with the system will

144
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,189
accept and if you think about that you
can probably emphasized that they that

145
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:09,930
they're basically get a little bit
desperate some of you may have seen this

146
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,709
before

147
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,829
yes by the way when you see this kind of
humor is always a sign off the

148
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,839
underlying it's always a sign that there
is a lot of pain and then these five

149
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,910
people basically used human also
releasing the pain they they experience

150
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:33,390
so high number of potential to hear this
organization is government organization

151
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:40,029
we were looking at people still at work
and then you the memory workload stops

152
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,450
to multiply because it's not just the
past but you have to remember you then

153
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,260
have to remember which costs what we're
gonna switch systems and if that's the

154
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:54,600
difference and user IDs then it's time
for another thing on to it every there's

155
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,630
just so many things to can go get that
wrong and in this organization also some

156
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,439
people complained about the use of our
RSA tokens because they're so now the

157
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,089
other thing I have to remember is that
is to bring this thing with me

158
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,309
with me I come to anything on that could
I might have to drive another hour and

159
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:20,749
then back in and that's that's a
gigantic waves as he will see later on

160
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:25,249
however in other organizations i've seen
that replaced it with something else and

161
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:29,040
then people were pounding on the door
and reminding our site tokens back it

162
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,529
costs you can make it even worse menace
so the long-term impact on productivity

163
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,600
Voice busboys basically a case of the
times about what we could see here in

164
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,189
this organization is that people
literally stopped to reorganize their

165
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:50,009
work to minimize the exposure to
authentication so tough that should be

166
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:55,699
done on a regular basis and not be back
just so they basically to make the

167
00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:00,300
authentication worthwhile and then you
do as many top behind and go on that may

168
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,689
be ok in some environments but then I
thought environments for your service

169
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:08,839
actually realized you continuously
serving customers and so for instance it

170
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,449
can actually create a problem but we
thought they were in the office of the

171
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:15,050
system

172
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,229
laptops piling up that people have to
return and set keep it but I don't want

173
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:27,620
to name just three but then you cannot
login when you when you are traveling

174
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:35,009
and so and so every but so you can wait
you know i'll do my email when I get

175
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:40,170
back but I'm not going through this
cycle decrypting the machine logging

176
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,819
into the site catering to think again
it's just not worth it

177
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:50,069
now basically now you can see what what
what productivity things are happening

178
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:54,449
in both in in this study and in another
study done in Aus government

179
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:57,920
authentication where they looked at the
Common Access Card CAC card be

180
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,099
introduced myself decrease in the number
of hours worked from home the number of

181
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,750
time that people logged in from home

182
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,189
and then both studies it was calculated
that the their free lost the free time

183
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,449
the government was sweet was losing here
from employees to actually love that

184
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:24,050
jumping rope willing to work more goes
into the hundreds of millions even more

185
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,720
stunning was that people reported that
they tapped from IBS and wanted to do

186
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,920
try something new and do something
different but then on reflection decided

187
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,100
not to bother because they're Sep
securities going to mix this anyway you

188
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,709
know they won't let house basically let
these people onto network that gives

189
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,440
them give these credentials so well you
know the quote from one of the most will

190
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,020
trust model on get to the result the
results won't be as good and we'll get

191
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,290
them not later but I'm just out of time

192
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,580
emotional energy of these these
restrictive security policies I just

193
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,560
can't take anymore if any of the
compliance budget paper published in

194
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,790
2009 that's a good illustration and then
the worst case we've seen this

195
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,240
particularly in in in in trading
environments is that but from some

196
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,250
people just leave you know and it's
often the best people who leave their

197
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,280
site who refused to be tied tied down
what their fears over restrictive

198
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,670
policies and say I can't do perform as
well as you know as well as I want to

199
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:39,790
hear go somewhere else where they'll
actually let me so even if you will and

200
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:46,680
if we lose so much productivity so be it
the impact on security is also it's also

201
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:54,140
not really so what people do is it and
what we found in organizations time and

202
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,440
time again and that includes Barry

203
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,440
very security environments you'd expect
to be very secure and such as the

204
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,790
military what you find is that
non-compliance particular authentication

205
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,760
policies is very widespread and people
just create a huge amount of work

206
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,250
arounds and ways of getting around and
that's bad news because those work

207
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,430
around fled to the users themselves
don't realize that it creates all

208
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,930
abilities and problems but it does and
I'll show you a couple of examples in

209
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:32,490
addition I would argue it creates
creates you know having rule that being

210
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,930
obeyed and and where everybody realizes
that I'm picking up it creates a really

211
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,100
bad security culture and one of the key
things in the military for managing your

212
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,149
staff is always never given order that
cannot be obeyed because if you go to

213
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:54,380
give my notice that company abate its it
reduces the power off all orders from

214
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,850
hearing it just blows your credibility
and finally it's really bad for security

215
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,709
because if you are trying to monitor how
well your securities doing and there's

216
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,890
all this non-compliance going on that
just not malicious it creates a level of

217
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,770
noise when you're looking on your
systems are you looking what's going on

218
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,620
in your organization and you know what
we attack us love this they're going

219
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:26,360
like we fantastic you know we can hide
in this a lot easier for them when that

220
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,379
is when that's going on so that when
people really just forget when they do

221
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,800
these workarounds and everybody does a
people forget that they doing it and

222
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,230
I've got close to a hundred pictures and
I've got dozens of videos of people

223
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:49,250
really just forgetting what they what
they've done so you basically this is

224
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,370
from last winter's

225
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,419
emergency warning broadcast on national
TV username emergency planning hospira

226
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,620
2014

227
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,179
well

228
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,820
wasn't particular I V Festival to stop
but while we're at it I think we'll

229
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:14,070
throw in the webcast well because why
not and whether you do this in football

230
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:20,770
it's basic if done here in the in that
the week he you know what its World Cup

231
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,070
also very seguida sometimes wonder when
you see it a crime to bother having won

232
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,679
in the first place if it's if it's like
that and here is facing even in the

233
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,600
military as you can see there if we
worked it out so the wifi passwords I

234
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,510
just you know reporters coming in taking
pictures of everything that's just very

235
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,920
common and if you've just been if you
this chief executive of TV song the

236
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,990
French station just had a major major
breach you know your your system down

237
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,160
what you do you go on national
television to explain what's going on

238
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,560
what's your Facebook and Twitter
passwords and all are behind you and the

239
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:12,730
game being broadcast on national TV
that's so on the one hand gesture you

240
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,450
could turn around and say like stupid
uses but this is really that's the

241
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,980
reality that's how that happens when
people create these workarounds because

242
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,240
there's no other way of managing it and
then that's what you do day-to-day and

243
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,000
people just forget so I think we'd
really like to move on from that and

244
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,210
security people with problems don't
always practice what they preach if you

245
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:43,430
remember the hacking team incident where
does this company that makes well

246
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,800
security products or spy products
depending where you are taken down you

247
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,379
know they put their passports were
particularly good either so the result

248
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:01,680
really it is it's fortunate place to be
is to most use a security is a joke and

249
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,380
particularly passwords the possible
policies they experience on a day-to-day

250
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,730
basis are just a joke they they
dissipate and nothing happens and the

251
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,840
result is it sweetie we're in pretty bad
place when it comes to two security

252
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,490
culture in organizations and even when
we if we now stopped working and make

253
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,360
security comp liable we're going to have
a long hard road to actually get back to

254
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,229
undo all the bad habits that people have
a quiet as a result of just trying to

255
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:40,850
cope with unusable security thing since
when do you want to create a mechanism I

256
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,750
guess you've got to keep on watching
what's happening we passed about three

257
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:51,120
years ago the point where the majority
of passports I know entered on touch

258
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,629
screens after post on people and the
usability people worked quite quick to

259
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,030
come out with this type of with the
studies to show that the entry time of

260
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:07,100
the same password if you've got to come
come come

261
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,909
what we call a company password so it
characters with complexity of at least 3

262
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,710
characters sides that the entry time
even for a practised Hughes on the top

263
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,530
screen is three times as high on the
keyboard and the error rate goes up by a

264
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,800
factor of three to five and basically
the longer the passwords get the worse

265
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
it gets

266
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,750
again colleagues from missus did these
studies and produced the table to reach

267
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,630
you can you can look it up and you're
cute it's ok so the majority of people

268
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,080
are now entering things things this way

269
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:51,850
but how you know we really need to adapt
to this so we can't really issues and

270
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,629
FYI this is sort of a couple of years
ago comes out and says killed the

271
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:03,269
password you know you've gotta be
worried about this is happening and

272
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,029
people are looking for other
technologies the fighter alliance is

273
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:09,669
basically Baisakhi

274
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,970
wrapping up and I saw them at the
biometrics conference to see that very

275
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:22,159
very bullish about the growth experience
of providers joining joining them and I

276
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,149
think you know basically looking looking
at those kind of kind of solutions but

277
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:31,158
effective you still building on some
some ideas of the architecture but you

278
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,230
do away with a mechanism as far as you
are concerned you make it easier is

279
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,350
probably the way forward

280
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,779
I certainly think just want to very
briefly say I think that in the

281
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:45,399
literature of usable security there's
some really crazy suggestions of

282
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:51,199
allegedly more usable authentication
that I think I'm going to work now

283
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,820
Microsoft has come up with actually
guilty will be responsible for a few of

284
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,279
them so the authentication by a
Rorschach inkblot test ever seen these

285
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:06,779
things I put like a symmetric brought
their fund a few and psychiatrists

286
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,669
normally use that and depending what you
see in them that diagnosis so they said

287
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,779
oh you're basically remember bits from
on the in crowd singing your password

288
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:19,850
into the computer or another Microsoft
special ringing up your friends in the

289
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,299
middle of the night and saying do you
remember that code I gave you a few

290
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,029
months ago

291
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:31,250
well I mean to to really go find it
because you need to vary fights with me

292
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,649
so I can get back into my account that's
gonna make you really pop so we're not

293
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,789
just bothering the uses

294
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:46,950
maybe maybe you can give your code to to
some of those guys I'm sure that people

295
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,259
each piece to help the other one was
like well you should just be talking

296
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:55,970
about technology should be smart to them
this is he should just think you pass

297
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:01,220
within that was used to hold this paper
is one of those crazy ideas are you

298
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,239
basically get get into free eg fuhrman
and I'm this is the case I was wrong

299
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:12,289
because you can now transfer $300 so
let's get these de motif helmet which

300
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:17,489
game misused in order to bypass not get
the bypass the manual entry of anything

301
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:22,539
you just basic you direct your figures
around the screen by thinking about the

302
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:26,749
further development of assistive
technology that's used for disabled

303
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:32,090
people so maybe this one actually was
stopped after all you can't just think

304
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,749
it and the computer recognize that it's
the correct prosper

305
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:42,749
meanwhile in in in in the world out
there is of course is in large parts of

306
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:48,739
the world bank banking people moved onto
tokens there that quiet spread widely

307
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:50,940
used but they are expensive

308
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,309
there's no doubt about it providing have
to provide this 222 10200 thousands of

309
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:02,379
customers it's a significant expands and
in the in the study sweet diamonds from

310
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:08,349
American coexist on Islam forest people
don't want don't particularly like it

311
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:12,158
because at the end of the day what
you're getting is you just getting more

312
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,979
/ lay out on top of the possible that if
they give you one of those you don't get

313
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:24,820
you still have a password password or
depended to future yet another one-time

314
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:30,189
password or PIN that goes with them and
then when they lay out all the stuff on

315
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:35,330
it such as possible entry only give us
the you know we want to have the third

316
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,349
the ninth and the 15th character off
your password again when people

317
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:44,359
basically stopped pounding the table
increasingly with the head and not just

318
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,149
with

319
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:52,248
you know because these these greedy
annoying error prone task that takes

320
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:57,070
significant amounts of time so not
really much of improvement I think one

321
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,149
of the most money implementation
sexiness

322
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:04,830
cryptic comment in principle you think
it's a nice idea but if implemented like

323
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:10,509
these guys did which was that you
basically have to in to use idea and it

324
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:14,979
generates and they did in which you
enter into the car and then the comp

325
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:19,149
gives you an eight character password
which is valid for one minute that you

326
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:25,869
have to enter back into the system that
you're looking into and here is where

327
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:31,468
the people who'd previously used the RSA
token started hammering on the door and

328
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:35,059
said I want my life back

329
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:40,739
test of how good idea and understanding
workload is why why is is it not the

330
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:46,999
same to do this number one is why is
that not the same as using using the RSA

331
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:52,049
token it's more steps number one

332
00:29:52,049 --> 00:30:00,450
ok but also this one step but this is
with practiced use quite easy to do with

333
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,409
the RSA token it's very hard to do here

334
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:11,099
yes so reading off a six digit purely
numerical code you can read it off

335
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:15,899
rehearse it in your head once an
interest in one go and you can do that

336
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:20,369
within a minute and eight character
complex string you can't read all in one

337
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:24,089
go so you end up like going back and
forth and back and forth and that if

338
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,649
increases the likelihood of us and by
the time you finally managed to get you

339
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:34,768
one minutes need to start all over again
it's nothing against the trip to Cali

340
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:40,269
principle it's about how you implement
it and the argument I can ask them is so

341
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:45,649
why did you choose and eight character
complex process work and the answer was

342
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:50,668
well because we could and should be
that's most secure than the sixth time

343
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:53,419
in the six digit numeric code

344
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,460
yes but it's only valid for one minute

345
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:04,360
the six did the six digit america is
perfectly good enough just want you to

346
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,110
quickly highlight of course when it
comes to token Frank is trying to do the

347
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:14,179
right thing which is to have a token
based solution that doesn't mean they

348
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,880
use a basic he still keeps all these
ridiculous additional thing and it's

349
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,600
just like we want to actually really
make it easy to use

350
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:30,080
so what is the competition out there and
increasing me the noise is you know what

351
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,460
you hear rumbling in the background of
coming towards space it's the second

352
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,100
coming of biometrics as I call it now we
had a kind of like a full

353
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,780
in the early 2000 mouth that's basically
on its way back again with the cryptic

354
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,610
out of course it's if you don't
implemented properly you can screw it up

355
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,530
pretty badly so they did in this case
you know people were complaining about

356
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:01,550
the past with us and find have a
fingerprint reader about a quarter off

357
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:10,520
of the stuff did but then every 90 days
they had to stop in that draw trying to

358
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,660
find that piece of paper with the 88
character complex password on it to

359
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:23,360
guarantee and then have to think up
another a correct false world that they

360
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,320
would never use except for like write it
on the piece of paper to use again in 30

361
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,350
days time and then had been there had to
re-enroll the fingerprint against you

362
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:42,560
get like that it is again it's just you
know that's just cruel if you're not

363
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,080
willing to integrate the biometrics
properly into a people i doing this

364
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,010
really is no point you can make it
almost in a day-to-day basis the

365
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,780
fingerprint uses what happened but every
time this happens you can imagine you

366
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,920
know they would

367
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,440
that basic UI care like you know this is
this is just you know and justice SSI

368
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,150
angry at their get when they have to
change for infrequently used system that

369
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,720
basically had to go through this
exercise sometime soon but if you if you

370
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,200
have a ninety day expiry window and
using a system twice a day

371
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,410
you do the password changed twice
absolutely nothing to keep the password

372
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,200
to life and my my argument is if you've
got such a frequent use systems you're

373
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,900
better off giving people want I'm codes
you know don't even bother asking them

374
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,930
to remember and it's not going to work
but back to environment Expedia print

375
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:42,110
done better in the the bumbling got
considerably noisy with the introduction

376
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,770
of the iPhone and the touch idea on that
you know that was with one stroke six

377
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:52,550
million users six million biometric use
us and so far it's been the agenda

378
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,770
experience over overwhelmingly good what
you would expect from Apple if you know

379
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,620
they just didn't stick with old dog when
they implemented that they went down way

380
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,010
so traditional enrollment is you slap
your finger down three times and then

381
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,320
calculates the temp played by doing
their homework they actually realized

382
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,710
that's not you know you end up with
templates and I'm particularly good ok

383
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,860
let's make use of spend a bit more time
on the enrollment ask if you've got a

384
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,310
pic put your finger down about 10 times
in order to get proper coverage of the

385
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:32,320
hanger in exchange for them having a
seamless experience later on and that

386
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,350
works there also decided to keep the pen
alive and that's smart decisions where

387
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:45,429
there's nothing worse than if you say
you have a backup that Japan pins even

388
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,860
faster than passwords so if you don't
use it for a while if it's just gonna be

389
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:55,200
gone so by effectively pushing the other
forcing the user to keep using the pen

390
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,040
occasionally by keeping it alive from
that's a good idea and their salts

391
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,700
so various banks have now come out and
said we're going to use the touch idea

392
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:15,299
here in the UK and others months with
the face recognition on the firm so this

393
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,140
was czech model funny Baba at sea but
earlier this year

394
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,750
announcing his smile to pay system but
Alibaba would be using its very much

395
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,300
we're all very interested because it
means they must be using a different out

396
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,550
and then was traditionally because
smiling is one of the things that messes

397
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,260
up face recognition normally so there
must be a deep learning our group them

398
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,030
to to get around but interesting on the
other hand I still think from a user

399
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,960
punish knew this could be slightly
tricky if you just feel you've just paid

400
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,630
far too much for something and they are
being forced to 32

401
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:59,869
to prove it all made it up to a stick to
your cell from spending money on it so

402
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:05,750
we're still not really quite sure that
the

403
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,920
what's quietly on the outside behavioral
biometrics have been happy making their

404
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,140
way back to to to the surprise of many
actually their recognition rates are

405
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:26,920
better off those virtually all off the
static biometrics fingerprint and iris

406
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,609
better opens of course I'm up some
really interesting possibilities if I

407
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:37,150
can have a possible that and it's quite
a simple password nobody cares if it's a

408
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,190
word or you know it's it's like you know
the name of my dog and my kidney

409
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,420
combined into one or whatever then it
because in addition the system

410
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,519
recognizes how I type it now thanks
quite nice life you've got a one-step

411
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:58,049
two-factor authentication and reliable
on top of that here we might get to you

412
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,880
I was smarter technology that people
were Imam think you know so rapidly and

413
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,450
family this problem that we have with
entering the password on the touchscreen

414
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,470
Mike the error rates if you just turn it
around and say I'm going to use the way

415
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,470
how you miss hit the keys as a way of
identifying instead of as safe as a way

416
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,259
of saying we have now have possibilities
so that's actually a good illustration

417
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:28,400
of my by just sitting down as they work
with you know fitted with who is using

418
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,329
this on which device in which
circumstances and finding a good fit

419
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:40,509
we can actually make this real quick and
fairly smooth and maybe the paths would

420
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:46,079
cross which isn't you know isn't that
bad maybe it's just part of the new

421
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,660
small test solution and interesting
thing rediscovered its we salute during

422
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,470
various usability studies on biometrics
is that actually the password house want

423
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:02,459
significant advantage and that is that
it uses retain the feeling of control

424
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,570
so when we gave them this face
recognition system on the phone it

425
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,430
doesn't really matter which for some it
is it just happened to be tested this

426
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,750
particular this particular one that
people actually said is you know it

427
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,950
didn't they experience that he didn't
always work even if it doesn't work they

428
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,618
don't understand how it works and that
made them sort of quiet time he's

429
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,150
consistently fail I don't know what to
do if it's possible I can type it again

430
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,849
or if it's a cup chopped you know
everybody hates it and complains about

431
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:41,420
it but if I fail if you know I know it's
my fault and all I know I can do it

432
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,580
again if I fail to face recognition I
don't really know what's wrong if if I

433
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,520
really need to get in if I'm in a hurry

434
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,460
you know what what am I going to do I
have to you know have to to go find

435
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,160
someone so the other thing that people
actually people's context based

436
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,520
reasoning is there also a lot of them
were saying I don't like putting my face

437
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,730
on the internet for something that I
don't think requires high security even

438
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,510
though in this case they didn't actually
pasa facial information on it just just

439
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:18,950
recognize so the you know this is can
actually be like be a nightmare so the

440
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,890
other thing is like no maybe there's
also something that uses scan done and

441
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,540
that is like you know maybe you can
actually learn to love the password if

442
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:32,369
you haven't seen this I recommend that
you read this so something that you use

443
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:36,210
every day you know when you use it we
have we always ignore the emotional

444
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,980
component and at the moment we had just
sort of like hate you know sort of

445
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,030
hating profits because the difficulty
with failing but if you read this blog

446
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:51,990
is that isn't is another way so this guy
went through a divorce and then work on

447
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:58,560
top of all of this it forced him to
change his password and he said

448
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,700
couldn't focus I couldn't get on you
know what I need to do something and

449
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,990
then I decided my passport was going to
become the indication it it reminded me

450
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,759
that I shouldn't let myself be the
victim of this break helps you know that

451
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm strong enough to do something about
it so my passport became I forgive her

452
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,629
and so every time when I entered it you
know I was thinking I should give her

453
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,130
and he described in this story of how
this helped him to recover and get over

454
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:31,210
the break so you might think that is
extreme but it shows a creative way off

455
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,440
how you can get at that hour actually
sometimes ways of turning something

456
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,510
that's quite annoying into something
positive and I think we can we can do

457
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:49,460
that so to summarize really I think the
things that will kill the password is if

458
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,570
we keep banging on insisting on length
on strength that is not enough people

459
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:01,430
just just calm coping with the mental
gymnastics and long winded entry

460
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,470
procedure its training for optimize
productivity if we keep on insisting on

461
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,220
that people are definitely going to
desperately look for alternatives you

462
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,580
know where there isn't a possible at
figuring in it

463
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:18,310
house with expiring is particularly
egregious you know and it's it's really

464
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,950
the consequences of when you then failed
following a password expiry either you

465
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,879
fail because you can't create a new
password or you you do create a new

466
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,480
password but then in its very very
brittle in the first couple of days off

467
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,330
to change you know the old process with
this much stronger than the new one if

468
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,310
you fail then you end up like my
colleague Mark Harmon who suppress side

469
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:46,029
view seattle-based he sent the slum to
the computer center at the work at the

470
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:51,070
weekend saying you know yesterday as
possible in response to the secret

471
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:56,320
compressed you to process with aging
policy with aging

472
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:02,470
which of course I did the system
rejected several of my attempts to

473
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:08,640
construct a new process constraints
which I'll never reveal to the user once

474
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,600
they're broken I wrote on the final
possible that was accepted after Lucy

475
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,700
temps however I still come something
that will complement game you know and

476
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,730
I'm no knocked out you know and i cant i
cant get back in and basically this is a

477
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,730
photo of him at the help desk on Monday
morning and he is like a quick

478
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,180
illustration of a computer science
professor you know not getting his paper

479
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:37,930
done over the weekend and having to
queue for 20 minutes helped us to to get

480
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:44,710
it reset try people experience now
they're not going to be very happy now

481
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:49,500
help comes in the unlikely discussed in
the unlikely guy is all of these guys

482
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:57,380
you see the logo logo at the bottom CSG
which is of course here which is in here

483
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:02,150
in the UK responsible for setting
standards for information assurance that

484
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:10,090
popped the big evil agency that we do
not mention but what they have one day

485
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,720
she did following collaboration with
myself and Cormac Herley if they issue

486
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,390
these new guidelines which actually do
the things that I'm recommending out

487
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,140
there they were commending the same
things so they say don't expire possible

488
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,740
unless it's absolutely necessary

489
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,069
the onus of systems should take
responsibility for protecting parts with

490
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,110
files properly and they should employ
additional monitoring systems rather

491
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:43,880
than piling all the work all the
protection on to the passwords and so on

492
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,380
and it came out in September end of
September and if you look at the trade

493
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,030
press

494
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:59,630
response to to to this document is being
that is so beautiful said slightly

495
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:06,370
incredulously vitro so they can be done
and hopefully this is the start of a

496
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,440
road actually because they're very
clearly set in this document you've got

497
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,100
to work with your use us you know don't
demonize them don't just dumped all the

498
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:20,069
stuff on them help them to do the right
thing make it possible for them to do

499
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,490
the right thing and work together
because the real enemy is out there and

500
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:31,939
inside so I think that's that's a very
good things so we'll keep passwords

501
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:38,870
alive is if it's easy enough to do
people get used to them and the snow

502
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:44,759
miss you don't make it impossible to use
their feel in control and some people

503
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,280
use them for like herself therapy
medication Great Bend they they'll stick

504
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,480
with them so they will only work if you
use them often enough to to to to

505
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,740
basically make them happy and make them
automatic so we should take in free

506
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,259
preview sophistications out of the
equation put to one side and put

507
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,250
different mechanisms but that's the one
time or a graphical authentication or

508
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:18,150
whatever on to them the should basically
look at where he spent occasionally

509
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:23,610
occurs independent of the mechanism less
of a disruption will overall create

510
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:28,580
create much less this pain and make
people you said of course if we put this

511
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:34,390
on to you basically work with devices if
we put the second layer onto it whether

512
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:39,830
that is the biometric we use it to
deliver the one time code such a school

513
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:44,830
girl authenticator you know if most of
your uses smartphone to use it you know

514
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,490
people when they were separated from
their smartphone

515
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:53,529
and constantly connected that's trying
to work that work for them but they

516
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,810
needs to be the recovery needs to be
faster than extra reassurance and a

517
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:03,880
fallback you know and spending 20
minutes or half an hour MBq on on the

518
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,010
content to help that's not a viable
alternative i mean I'm going back for

519
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:12,369
god sake light even if you don't even
need if you lose your card or have your

520
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,920
comp stolen you can still go to a cash
machine and get money out of custom

521
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,650
developed a fall back into that far to
let people into systems where the risk

522
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:28,960
significantly less then then then in
terms of the money you know you can you

523
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,670
can take a similar risk-based approach
if you limit what people can do you know

524
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:37,250
maybe you shouldn't always you should
even that mean when they when they can't

525
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:42,340
get it so sometimes all you do
additional payload if you basically get

526
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:49,630
authentication and and transaction
verification all in one such as the

527
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:55,920
system self now they're not deployed in
Germany and in the Netherlands for

528
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,760
online banking Stephen murdoch's Qantas
system you know there again this like

529
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,350
you know that people actually quite
happy he's going ok yeah let me read

530
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,970
this through and make sure it's ok
before I pushed the button and couldn't

531
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:12,910
confirm it because you know that even
you know this is this a protector even

532
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:17,220
against the pretty evil man in the
browser attacks that otherwise capture

533
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,569
capture a lot of solutions I want so
that's basically my prediction so I

534
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:28,109
think I must be really mess it up past
with dead there will become part of new

535
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:35,020
easy to use solutions that's here's to
hoping that people will stop hating them

536
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,109
and just used to mask a part of their
everyday practice thank you very much
