1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:02:52,600
so

2
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,440
and track between them and found
something like forty three percent of

3
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,050
password for reuse between multiple
websites so this is obviously not

4
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,500
anecdotal people are doing this a lot

5
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,530
another thing that people do to cope
with the difficulties of passwords to

6
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,560
write them down and we could probably
debate the security vulnerabilities of

7
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,420
doing this but one thing that's going
wrong is that many end users

8
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,829
particularly are not adequately
protecting their recorded password list

9
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:31,040
a 2011 study found that people are 18
times more likely to write down unique

10
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,010
passwords then posted savory years so
there's obviously a strategy is being

11
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,109
used for some different words

12
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,080
tunnel work on security experts vs
non-experts bought their husband seems

13
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,180
to suggest that experts and non-experts
focus on different parts of the problem

14
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,290
there is a recent study published its
oops this summer

15
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,799
a survey study that looked at her
general security practices and it found

16
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,940
that experts mentioned unique passwords
admit they mention things like

17
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,380
installing security update using two
factor authentication using password

18
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,790
managers tragedies like this where is
not experts mentioned a different set of

19
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,060
things they talked about password
changes using antivirus software and it

20
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:31,690
only trying to visit only known websites
to them there's a 2009 paper by John

21
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,120
Norman where he talks about usual
security and present some kind of

22
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,730
anecdotal evidence about password
management he says he talked to a bunch

23
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,860
of security experts at a conference and
he said that what most people told them

24
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,930
was the used to passwords one strong one
weak and that they wrote down once it

25
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:57,700
didn't fit into this for 30 we want to
do a kind of principled examination of

26
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,789
what expert users do so we conducted
semi-structured interviews

27
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,160
with computer security experts each of
the last about 30 minutes and we audio

28
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,020
recorded them so that we could later
take notes and transcribe quotes from

29
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,930
them we recorded 15 participants
defining a tortoise is a little bit iffy

30
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,080
so we decided to go for a really safe
approach we recruited people from

31
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,140
security groups my current University
there are three of them as well as some

32
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,820
practitioners from industry out of these
fifteen people 13 them had graduate

33
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,820
degrees in computer security and I
believe that the numbers now increased

34
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:46,300
to 14 all of them were employed as
researchers or practitioners information

35
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,230
security may be roughly in line with the
distribution this room thirteen of our

36
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,610
participants were male or female and
they're probably on the kind of young

37
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:08,000
side the median age and/or interviews 29
our interview a bunch of questions about

38
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,080
how people manage their passwords we
specifically did not ask people what

39
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,700
their passwords were we are very clear
about this two people not the people

40
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,250
want to share their passwords
particularly expert so we ask more about

41
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,770
how what to do we asked about how many
passwords do you have asked how many

42
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,130
accounts do you have we tried to
encourage people to really think about

43
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,450
their answers so for instance in the
question about how many accounts you how

44
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:39,979
we broke it down into 20 categories and
rather than saying any chance you have

45
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,110
we said how many email accounts you have
how many travel related accounts do you

46
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,160
have how many online can count you have
to try to get people to really reflect

47
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,140
on like their account their practices
and to go through and try and give us

48
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,020
more accurate answers hopefully we asked
questions about how people choose

49
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,479
passwords and create new accounts what
are their prices around that and we also

50
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,710
explored other scenario

51
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,830
those changing and resetting forgetting
passwords I kinda thing and the field

52
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,710
the dust to dust that one was a sort of
quantitative set of descriptive response

53
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,739
is the sort of numbers of people gave us
to these questions how many passes do

54
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,940
you have how many passwords do you use
and what is really the more interesting

55
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,750
data set the qualitative data set of
people's discussion their detailed

56
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:40,550
responses and I'll spend most of the
talk discussing those but to give an

57
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,100
overview of the quantitative data in our
study experts reported having a median

58
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,820
of 64 accounts and 58 passwords to
stanch the higher than what we saw in

59
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,409
earlier interviews with end users and if
the Stanley higher than the numbers

60
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,560
found in the literature which are often
more on the order of sort of ten or

61
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,750
twelve accounts and passwords that work
is mostly quarter to date but this is

62
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,080
really a lot higher they say people are
very private about what they let their

63
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,960
customers actually worried be encouraged
them and that privacy but people talked

64
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,590
about having a kind of algorithmic
strategies around generating passwords

65
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,690
if they're doing it over there had
eighty percent of our participants

66
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:38,159
tri-cities said that they reused passage
so very high given that we're often

67
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,049
encouraging people as experts not to
reuse passwords

68
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:46,959
however people had a small memories
passwords the median was three and a

69
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,170
half and everybody in our study who said
that they reuse passwords was really

70
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,520
careful to follow up with yes but not
everywhere you know they they discussed

71
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,420
careful strategies

72
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,189
of clear waves of segmenting accounts
into reused or not and I'll talk more

73
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,000
about that later

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,320
again eighty percent of our participants
said that the user password manager

75
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,090
named money manager very broadly here
including passwords saved in the browser

76
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:22,060
managers managers here at least 80% half
of them so that they use dedicated

77
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,380
password management software in some
form or another but out of people who

78
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,980
did none said that they use their
managers exclusively which was kind of

79
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:43,980
surprising to me I thought we would get
people for being believe there's really

80
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,720
what was most interesting was the way
they talked about it that the detailed

81
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,170
descriptions of their password
management strategies and so we recorded

82
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,490
those and went back and took notes and
transcribed parts of them and we

83
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:08,280
conducted a systematic analysis of this
is a flexible qualitative analysis

84
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,800
method that let us sort of try to drive
the relationships and kind of identified

85
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,819
because pattern what was going on in
here so for this analysis we follow the

86
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,270
process of open coding where he
traversed arcade a line-by-line looking

87
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,890
for codes try to understand what is
happening in that specific instance and

88
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,710
then we took our codes of a shower 30
and we manipulated them we put them on

89
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:41,200
post-it notes on a whiteboard we do you
know clouds and thoughts around them we

90
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,209
tried to find a pattern in them and we
came up with four things

91
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:56,719
I first came with expert awareness and
this sounds intuitive but experts had

92
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,540
really consistent pre-planned strategies
and it's contrasting really strongly

93
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:07,389
with her earlier interviews were
excluded non-experts did not experts we

94
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:13,529
asked the same question a couple times
in interviews and the non-experts when

95
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,720
they got to question about resetting a
password which is essentially choosing a

96
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,110
password that things like oh yeah I
don't know how I do it that I can't

97
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,309
panic you know but experts said things
to us like I already answered this

98
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:30,368
question you know they were very clear
on what were the same events they had

99
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:35,600
consistent plans strategies for them
they're also where specific sets

100
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,740
obviously they work information security
I would hope that they are but they

101
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,790
discussed in relation to their own
personal password management strategies

102
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,389
in this quote this participants so I am
a couple of like my laptop got stolen

103
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:55,009
and you know you hear serious
vulnerability hardly anything to change

104
00:11:55,009 --> 00:12:03,199
them storage plan for failure they seem
to have a consistent strategies about

105
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,790
what to do when things went wrong which
the non-experts didn't for non-experts

106
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,420
talked about being uncomfortable about
panicking but experts didn't seem too

107
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:19,349
good on those roads however one of the
big problems of path roads are so we

108
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,369
don't live in an ideal world there are
all kinds of social and contextual

109
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:26,990
pressures you know wanting to log into
your email so you can show your mom a

110
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,110
picture of your latest vacation things
like this situation that you can't

111
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:38,339
foresee and experts were affected by
these two and in this second quote the

112
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,389
guy says well I can be a parent as I
want but in the real world ever family

113
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,299
and stuff so I have to compromise and
then he went on to discuss how he

114
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,410
changes his own personal password
management strategy to share accounts of

115
00:12:51,410 --> 00:13:01,699
his wife because basically he can expect
her to sort of live up to high standards

116
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:16,748
also said that they used 80% people
reuse passwords in some way or another

117
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:22,499
and I was surprised but if I thought
people would be sort of true believers

118
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:26,359
in one strategy but it seems that most
people use a combination of strategies

119
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:31,439
and the combination they came out most
often was using a dedicated password

120
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:38,419
manager for important accounts and
reusing a password what sounded like a

121
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:46,040
comparatively lame password if I can be
honest on other accounts in this quote

122
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,269
describes why he didn't put everything
in his power to manage my family home in

123
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,939
convenient food comes down to it he says
like there's an investment to store in

124
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:00,649
the password manager and underwriter
account to get his stature injured dirty

125
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,989
with all of its low importance accounts
that he prefers to have a kind of threw

126
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:07,660
a pattern that he uses on things he
doesn't care about he likes to keep his

127
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:15,980
passenger next it's very important

128
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:28,330
generation did you do you do where this
kind of thing that came up about a

129
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,660
personal assessment of risk that there
are good waiting security of knowing

130
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,480
exactly how much security is required

131
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,110
hard to make an objective assessment
particulars and user of service about

132
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,330
exactly what threats and risks are about
exactly how to defend against them and

133
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,870
you don't get good feedback here either
you never know whether your account

134
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,690
wasn't compromised because you're
possibly so good because no one ever

135
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:06,630
tried to attack it and really explicitly
and I think almost everybody in our

136
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,420
study talked about this aspect of
personal assessment and this quote that

137
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,780
the participants says well I have two
passwords that are and any corrections

138
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,459
officers what I consider to be more
secure and not only is for a few things

139
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:28,080
but I consider them more valuable and
interesting I thought people went down

140
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,340
this river talked about the difficulty
in making these personal assessments but

141
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,070
they didn't they seemed very comfortable
with it but in the same breath seemed to

142
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,060
acknowledge it very explicitly which I
thought was very interesting that they

143
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,630
knew that they were having their own
personal view on this and and putting

144
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,680
their personal judgment into it but
there's experts felt very comfortable

145
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,430
with that

146
00:15:52,430 --> 00:16:00,589
but we could probably have cast to make
mistakes to usability problems lead

147
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,540
experts to have problems

148
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:10,529
1% referred to a signed password is
ridiculous strings of horror i cant me

149
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:15,860
laugh and people have different ways of
coping with this one thing the camper

150
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,810
couple times with people who tried to
really minimize their online presence in

151
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:26,359
this quote and participants so I tried
all my passwords and let my partner

152
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,240
manager he said you know i i keep track
of the 405 matter to me you know I let

153
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,160
her go and see if it was clear that
sometimes feasibility problem experts to

154
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,560
make mistakes we had more than one can
tell us that they picked passwords by

155
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,589
using dictionary words from their native
language and this is a fallacy it's no

156
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,529
harder to search dictionaries and other
languages than English even if we

157
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:01,279
primarily working English people talked
about doing what's getting a few get

158
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:09,270
their passwords and we think they're
hard to avoid you know that passwords

159
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,709
are really awkward I think we all know
that there's nothing fun about passwords

160
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,470
are difficult

161
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,390
so experts versus not experts I was
really surprised when I did these

162
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,069
interviews I thought that experts will
look dramatically different then the

163
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,690
non-expert we had earlier interviewed
and when I went and I conducted this

164
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,640
interview is my first thought was oh my
god they're exactly the same I was quite

165
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:46,840
surprised by this I was shocked
passwords in in both of our set of

166
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,199
interviews people talked about having
had their passwords for a long time I

167
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,860
was i laughed when our previous speaker
so they notice first catherine is

168
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,740
because my interviews with lead me to
believe that most people are still using

169
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,159
their first passport in some form or
another

170
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,780
maybe maybe it's been kind of changed
over the years that people talked about

171
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,639
passwords both experts and non-experts
going back a long way this kind of

172
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:17,090
emotional attachment to those passwords
and unload importance accounts but for

173
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,980
high importance accounts the experts for
using password managers they were using

174
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,940
the generation function within password
managers but they're very clear they

175
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,100
weren't doing this everywhere this is
not like their passwords strategy this

176
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,199
was their important strategy an
interesting week we saw non-experts

177
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,830
trying to do the same thing but not
experts seem not to do it is effectively

178
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,970
so we think that this careful
segmentation there didn't seem to be

179
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:50,200
nearly as much blurry middle for the the
experts as it was for the non experts is

180
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,659
how users with expert users are more
successful at managing passwords and

181
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:03,970
non-experts question is sort of success
you know I was saying earlier like these

182
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,450
are cognitive tasks

183
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,610
and what makes an expert and expert we
are careful to choose people who had

184
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,110
high knowledge of the domain but if you
look at the literature and expertise

185
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,110
it's usually defined as having high
knowledge and high success and he talked

186
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,469
about and things like tennis so in
tennis to be attached expert getting

187
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,750
know a lot of a tennis after win a lot
of matches but i win

188
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,670
security match you know I think a lot of
feedback you don't have any sort of

189
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:45,700
evidence of success how do you measure
that success and it turns out that the

190
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,650
literature also says that expertise
comes from skill decision-making

191
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,560
particularly in these kind of pill
structured problems for success isn't

192
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:59,350
very clear and the situation awareness
is the perception of elements in the

193
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,110
environment within a volume of time and
space the comprehension of their meaning

194
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,449
and the projection of their status as
the near future and situation awareness

195
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,240
means having learned knowledge and
skills with a which experts obviously

196
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,880
have been having schemas reporters
typical situations understanding what

197
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,380
the typical situations are going to be
it was clear that people did it really

198
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,170
fought through the idea that they were
going to have to reset forgotten

199
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,710
passwords that they were going to be
situations where they knew what they did

200
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,890
it means having mental models of the
domain people

201
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,730
experts rest of you certainly did and
having automatic processes for those

202
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,190
this domain and I would say that
security expert at all of those and I

203
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,090
think that this is really what allows
security experts to your password

204
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,559
management experts

205
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:57,249
and other things one of our goal is to
help end users improve their password

206
00:20:57,249 --> 00:21:02,279
management techniques and hopefully the
expert approach would help us come up

207
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,009
with some ideas here and so it occurs to
me that one thing we need to do is help

208
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:13,419
non-expert users become more situational
aware and I have a couple of ideas about

209
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:18,110
how we can do this I think that making a
little bit more information available

210
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,748
would be very helpful then users we have
multiple people both experts and non

211
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:28,879
tell us about the frustration of linking
up a good password memorizing it taking

212
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,949
it and having it rejected by the
password policy there's no reason not to

213
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,799
have those rules on the front page that
we're not winning a lot of security by

214
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,320
obscuring them and were causing a lot of
problems also think that website log

215
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,039
information should be available online
banking sometimes does this region

216
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,090
clicking and see a different interface
and see when people last logged in but

217
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,970
in an earlier interview something that
came up with people said well I think I

218
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,169
got hacked but I don't really know how
to tell wasn't sure what to do about it

219
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,869
and so first time where they can go in
and to see if they were the last person

220
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:11,199
to logins way of addressing this we also
think that I also think we should be

221
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,769
encouraging the use it easily adopted
strategies and one of the things that I

222
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,450
really think we should be pushing his
password managers and I know that there

223
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,480
are people in this room

224
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,999
easy sell but one thing I really like
about them in the context of situation

225
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,539
awareness is that they provide this
centralized place to think about your

226
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,309
passwords to see how many accounts you
have to see any password you have I know

227
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,749
last pass on one Password have kind of
security audit or watchtower I think

228
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:41,480
it's called and one Password features
but do a kind of assessment of the

229
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,200
overall security and I think that most
non-expert really missing a place to

230
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,289
think about the bigger picture Experts
for better but thinking about the bigger

231
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,690
picture but I suspect that they could
benefit from these kinds of tools as

232
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,470
well

233
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,159
single sign-on would also fit into this

234
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:03,559
but I think that it's harder for end
users to try and adopt single sign-on

235
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,440
it sort of is up to the website to
provide a single sign-on but an end-user

236
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,489
can have a lot of control over whether
or not the user password manager which

237
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:16,599
is why I think that it's probably the
answer however after managers they're

238
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:24,149
really frustrating to adopt to set up to
migrate to and I would love to see those

239
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:33,258
issues addressed because I think that
would really help and finally have a

240
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,849
point but I think we need to discuss the
real risks and the corresponding

241
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:45,019
defenses for users who kind of a joke
this is a real product but are not

242
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:48,179
expert interviews people wrote their
houses down but didn't store them

243
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,479
securely and so this is kind of a joke
and you know I would advocate for it

244
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,999
more strongly they didn't say the
password long walk across the front but

245
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,509
ultimately I think its way through safer
to have this in your purse then to store

246
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:06,309
your password list in Dropbox you know
if not the world's worst idea that if we

247
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:12,499
can emphasize the real defenses for
possible risks to people and give better

248
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:16,809
heuristics I got a number of non-expert
stymie in our interviews but they've

249
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,658
stopped using browser based managers
because somebody had told them that it

250
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:27,849
wasn't secure and ok it's not a great
idea to save your banking password if

251
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:31,629
you're concerned about I don't know your
son breaking into your bank account and

252
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,168
spending all your money but you should
absolutely savored logins to close your

253
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:42,580
browser if it you know I'm sure life

254
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,389
their problems are addressed by
situation awareness that expert

255
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,510
knowledge one thing that came up
repeatedly in our expert interviews with

256
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,929
password changes her time consuming
aware how awkward it was also affect his

257
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:03,590
ability of password managers because one
of the benefits of password managers is

258
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,299
that you should be able to change your
passwords to randomly generated ones

259
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,360
having played by the accounts but going
through this process is just awful

260
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,269
things changing it copying and pasting
it will not working they came up with a

261
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:24,049
round pattern manager usability why
aren't people who already use them using

262
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:27,760
them for everything else i mean this
person in my earlier quote talked about

263
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,510
wanting to keep its database clean but
the commission to the inconvenience the

264
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:37,929
extra effort and I'm not sure what the
answer is here but I think there's

265
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:46,190
something going on there and so in
conclusion to support all users expert

266
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,919
users to need help people develop tools
to increase situation awareness and

267
00:25:52,919 --> 00:26:00,080
address during usability issues thank
you very much
