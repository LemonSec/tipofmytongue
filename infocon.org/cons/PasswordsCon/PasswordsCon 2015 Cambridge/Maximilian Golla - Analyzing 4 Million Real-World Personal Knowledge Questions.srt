1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:22,830
refereed papers say hello so my first
question is have you ever forgotten your

2
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,709
password

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,119
I'm pretty sure some of us did in the
case one can no longer recall the

4
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,540
password one is usually challenge
transom security questions instead those

5
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,110
security questions

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,650
typically refer to the present in memory
of the user as they need to be a

7
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,260
memorable over longer time frames that's
we call them personal knowledge

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,120
questions in a recent project we
analyzed for million real-world personal

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,750
knowledge questions of a dataset that is
in contrast to previous work publicly

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,720
available so before I start I want to
get a short introduction to recap and to

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,160
agree on a common language what for Bank
of indication is for those of you who

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,210
are bored they can enjoy those adorable
kittens which should be mandatory at

13
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,449
every pessimists presentation rights and
the others I want to give a short

14
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,740
introduction to further indication so
far the indication is used to regain

15
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,780
access if the primary means of
authentication is lost so you have

16
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,630
forgotten your password and need to
access a service there different kinds

17
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,140
of can be used for example as we heard
yesterday from facebook there have been

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:51,270
communication via email or SMS sadly
does not always applicable just the case

19
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,320
you want to access an email provider and
have forgotten the password for it or in

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,869
my case here in Cambridge there's
transport is USA don't have access for

21
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,500
example to receive an SMS or an email
and in the case of our data said the

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,830
mighty privacy issues you don't want to
hand out your mobile phone number

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,810
or email address then there are those
personal knowledge questions we want to

24
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,680
hear about today and there's already
known that there are other insecure

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,650
because two answers can be guests and of
course tentative which would be more

26
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,480
secure like bowling systems preference
questions and they're even implicit

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,730
memory based solutions is quite
different to primary authentication in

28
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:45,070
terms for example of memorability they
need to be longer or not memorable and

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,070
the case of communication there's heavy
rate limiting applied to it and

30
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:57,930
sometimes the case for example of
trusted contacts have to wait 24 hours

31
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,840
before you can authenticate so the time
required to authenticate indirect rate

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,980
limiting is quite different to primary
authentication if we consider a texan

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,340
areas about against those personal
knowledge questions then literature at

34
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,170
least two different attackers first of
all the target a tech we have heard of

35
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,549
it before in there are prominent
examples like the wild entre might hold

36
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,989
him who got hacked by the use of the
personal knowledge questions or the

37
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,870
security questions that are in place at
Emerson

38
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,430
the attackers used those information to
Hector personal knowledge questions of

39
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,870
Apple's iCloud service and this way they
get access to his account and deleted

40
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,610
his computer and everything and
destroying attacker who just tries to

41
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,670
take any possible account he gets this
based on a population-wide statistics

42
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,619
and simultaneously detect many accounts
so he really doesn't care which a

43
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,980
counterattack just as much as possible
and there's an in-depth analysis from

44
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,738
this year about rivard personal
knowledge questions which is a sign of

45
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:21,000
any person I know however the state has
said publicly available so no one can

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,100
reproduce the results

47
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,780
in our paper be considered a technology
attack model of statistical guessing a

48
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,700
tech so we don't have any specific
knowledge about a specific user and we

49
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,840
consider an ideal attacker who knows

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,700
approximation of the distribution of the
answers so our security and I just

51
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:51,110
wanted us to know about security because
practice I realized that I only have a

52
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,010
rough approximation of the distribution
of dance this gives us through security

53
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,400
against two kinds of attacks

54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,299
first of all online guessing attacks
were you contact the server and second

55
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,570
guessing attacks when you're trying to
for example attack a hashed file which

56
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,990
is on your local hard disk and you are
only limited by your computational power

57
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:23,650
and if we consider those online testing
a text we have nice metric and this

58
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:30,000
example this number one well you can see
here just days that states that you have

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,930
allowed to make one single gas against
the service and then you proceed to the

60
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,740
next user and in this case of course you
can you guess the most likely answer

61
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
first

62
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:49,010
and in this example you can compromise
up 23 percent of all accounts so the

63
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,599
lower this number is more secure or more
assists and you are against online

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,080
guessing attacks and offline guessing
attack scenario you calculate the

65
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,659
password guessing entropy also known as
as I guess work and in this case the

66
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,470
security of skip them and did so the
highest number is the better before I

67
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,710
proceed I want to outline my talk now we
have this introduction and we can dive

68
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,010
into our dataset after this I'll explain
something about robots in the state has

69
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,280
said and finally stay the results

70
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,400
so the data that we consider was dating
website that opened in 2002 and had 37

71
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,630
million users this number change
depending on the website you listed for

72
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,900
themselves they say they have almost 40
million users so I really don't know

73
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,739
exactly they had 27 preach in July and
attackers dictator they obtained and

74
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:00,350
breach in August by a bitter end and it
contained the databases to source code

75
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,850
of the website

76
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:09,980
credit card transaction locks and even
the Inbox of the CEO so pretty sleek and

77
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,640
it was over 20 gigabytes however only
considered a single table of this leak

78
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,690
all the other files were deleted

79
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,510
not used this file scored a member

80
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:29,820
table and you can see the table here on
on the slide we only use this two

81
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,300
columns called security questions and
security answers and of course there are

82
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,220
other columns but those are only useful
but filtering and aggregation of the

83
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,530
precise so we consider different age
groups and nationalities the question

84
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,429
arises affected by the sleek

85
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:01,510
you can find it online by Joy alongs or
who plotted the location of the users

86
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:08,289
which were also known also included and
the leak and you can spot there's a huge

87
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:15,620
number of users in Europe and there's a
reason for it and that's why I have this

88
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,789
next flight about to robots we are now
in the third power to understand what

89
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,750
the robots are one has to understand the
business model of this website so

90
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:35,520
contacting you members of this website
required credits so money and deleting

91
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,088
the account on this website also costs
money

92
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:46,309
and actually medicine used to boat's to
send messages to users to lure them into

93
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,920
a communication to earn money right and
this is another member I found online

94
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,779
and it states that the rate of engaging
us or parts account for a country and

95
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,809
you can see a huge number of phones in
Europe so this might be the reason why

96
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,029
we have seen and on the other

97
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:12,370
map that there are so many users in
Europe then there was this article by an

98
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,899
elite who found portrait a criteria we
applied to get there was also out of

99
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,749
this database and for example you can
use the email address of the user if

100
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:28,730
it's ending with extra medicine dot com
then it might be a broad then there's a

101
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:35,529
column called BC which stands for about
contact email chat last time if this is

102
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:41,339
still the default value 000 then we can
be pretty sure that this is a body count

103
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,589
as opposed to not contact each other
babe only contact real users and there

104
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,870
is a column called s host and hostess
another word for engage her or bought

105
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,740
and this might be an indicator if this
value is set to one then it might be a

106
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,499
part and their IP addresses of the users
and if this IP addresses home addresses

107
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:11,079
so private addresses then they may be
also boat's however we did not use it as

108
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,758
this information was only on only
available in their credit card

109
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,439
transaction locks and be deleted them
and did not use them due to ethical

110
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:28,599
considerations and there are also
positive indicators like not abort he

111
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,839
later today there is equipped hash in
the sleek and if this password value to

112
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,499
speak protest was changed to pay per
lead or 111 I will never do it again

113
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:45,860
then we can be pretty sure that this
account was a paid account someone paid

114
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,510
money to delete this account however the
service provider didn't really deleted

115
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,470
just change the hash to this value so
the user can no longer able to login

116
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:05,590
then there's this question if this is
legal or not in our opinion this is a

117
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,810
tentacle to do research on this data
leak because why because the latest

118
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,880
public at this point and we only
presented corrugated resides so we

119
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,700
ensure total anonymity of a specific
user error however it's unclear whether

120
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,260
the outcome outweigh any potential harm
so in my opinion you should listen to

121
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,360
talk to whom it's not too concerned
today at 5 p.m. by Alexandra she will

122
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,910
talk more about this and given the
example of a tremendous finally the

123
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:51,949
results of our analysis questions so we
can consider those questions

124
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,940
classics because they're really old and
no longer used today or I hope no longer

125
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,000
used today for example what is your
mother's maiden name what is the name of

126
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,160
your high school reform favorite sports
team and pretty pretty nice to create

127
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,130
this question about the last four digits
of your social security number as this

128
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:21,600
in our opinion only applies for the us-
and not for Europe but you will see

129
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,380
about this later if we want to have some
basic statistics

130
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:34,620
mmm table contains 32 million entries
however only four million users had

131
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,900
personal knowledge question set the
reason for this I don't know maybe it

132
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:48,780
wasn't mandatory to answer or to provide
those answers for the questions if we

133
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,420
have a look at the distribution of their
answers then the mother's maiden name

134
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,150
question was the most prominent one and
as I already mentioned fortitude social

135
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,360
security number was not that use

136
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:11,350
a lot of the times about the
significance because this is not based

137
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:18,589
but inspired by a previous work already
mentioned early breast time we tried to

138
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:24,519
go to apply the same significance metric
as they did so we used a resampling

139
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,620
approach if you consider for example of
this nine hundred thousand users here

140
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,450
then we took a random sample of 10
percent of the size and test if the

141
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,670
values fall in the fire for a 10% Arab
and or not and does with a probability

142
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:49,849
higher than 98% for 90% so if this was
not significant

143
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,860
printed are plotted dismantle symbol and
if if the number forwards and 10% Arab

144
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:05,000
and its Italian and otherwise it's
simply stole it now for those of you who

145
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,180
are shocked at his table just remember
those adorable kittens and focus on the

146
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,349
right hand side of the slide and for
others this table is important because

147
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,820
it provides some context and the context
is important to understand this numbers

148
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,260
so if we have a look at the number one
bedroom with which states that you are

149
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,740
only allowed to make one thing of gas
and then online guessing scenario I

150
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,290
highlighted doors says which are
important so you can see it here here

151
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:44,819
here then we can see this this number is
pretty consistent overall question so

152
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,930
the difference in question cannot be
seen if you only have one thing

153
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:58,209
guess however if you considered which
stated that you are allowed to make up

154
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,200
to 10 guesses then we can see that the
sports team question is very weak like

155
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,850
if you allowed to make 2010 guesses
against the site and for any user you

156
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:17,660
can compromise 20% nearly 20% of all
accounts and what about the difference

157
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,520
and nationalities their origin of the
user influences the questions not all of

158
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,680
them but for example to sports question
so they cannot sports teams

159
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,270
easier to guests and the USS once and we
also she does for the offering guessing

160
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:43,110
resistance which is not plotted here and
in this league we found a lot of fake

161
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,459
social security numbers so the most
popular answer which might be a correct

162
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:56,300
social security number is 1234 however
in court and not say a word or two zero

163
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,560
one percent of the cases part in two
daughters to 23 percent of the cases so

164
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,420
it must be a reason for that maybe it's
fake

165
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:13,189
they use us were not honest and also
popular and sassy receive a serial 11114

166
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:21,490
6969 and the difference in age we can
say that the age of the user influences

167
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,580
the security of the answers only a
little and he again the sports team

168
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:37,520
question we can see that with increasing
age I'm sorry easier to guess and yeah

169
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,069
we don't know the reason for that but
this is something with which we found in

170
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,800
the dataset and to have a comparison

171
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,760
so all of those security or personal
knowledge question slightly more secure

172
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,149
than a real road for the trip in the
trail pain from an iPhone however they

173
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:06,859
are all of course less secure than
passwords or random pins

174
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:15,010
yeah so the takeaway of this press no
knowledge questions only offer a lower

175
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:21,650
level of security security depends on
the age and origin of the user and the

176
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:28,809
sports team question is a great question
at all if you have any questions feel

177
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:37,320
free to us thank you

178
00:17:37,320 --> 00:18:12,799
however the case in question so December
ties it's not that big

179
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:20,668
the number however is significant at
least for this sorry number ten value

180
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:28,620
here so

181
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:35,750
yeah if I remember correctly the most
prominent answer for the sports in

182
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:51,640
question is maple leaves which is ice
hockey team of something and Canada only

183
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,730
thing we apply bourse changing all and
I'm still strapped her case but as we've

184
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:05,100
had not able to or as we did not
consider the source code right we were

185
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,280
unsure about which at a distance for
example strength distance was supplied

186
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,440
by this website so it might be that they
consider it leaves and Maple Leafs as

187
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,860
the same answers right so substring for
example but we did not have a look at it

188
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:54,750
but it has public so you can do it

189
00:19:54,750 --> 00:22:25,789
insecure

190
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:42,940
pretty simple metrics so it considers
the number of guests you are allowed to

191
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:58,649
make to compromise in the trolling a
tech so you have this number one then

192
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,928
you only allowed to make and one thing
that gets forum for an account right and

193
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:09,070
of course you guess the most likely
answer based on the approximation you

194
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:20,689
have at hand of the distribution of
dancers

195
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:51,700
yeah this paper from this year and they
more or less the same result

196
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,840
nationality influences and the agent
Florence's and there are questions that

197
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,649
are more secure and less secure
questions they're more usable and less

198
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:06,660
usable so I don't think that the service
which are your which is analyzed

199
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,060
influences the answer that much of
course there might be a difference

200
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,500
between an important service and less
important service but I don't know
