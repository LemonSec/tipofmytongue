1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:15,870
I okay so I'm here to percent it's me
this is a step toward our goal is to

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,509
find out the design identification
mechanism that valid alternative to

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:29,070
passwords so they cannot motivate why we
need such a replacement so it's

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,370
something that is and which we all agree
but it's not so easy as it looked like

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,919
and then some of our attempt so this is
a collaborative work actually the main

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:52,230
driver is not only for his problem not
be here so the replacement so let me

7
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,419
start putting the water came in a
context and showing my kids because i

8
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:13,190
dont trip to to comply so so we go from
personal computer to personal device

9
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:20,009
actually this kind of device now are
much more popular than PC and laptop

10
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,060
actually there is an entire generation
of people went

11
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,250
cyber so they use Internet

12
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,100
only with this device they never use PC
leptin green just really use it so this

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,679
is the kind of device and easy there is
not

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,120
keyboards of course there are soft
keyboards but

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,400
some of these are not really meant to be
used with keyboards and then the problem

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,070
is also not only that you don't have a
keyboard is that the human-computer

17
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:00,339
interaction pattern is not made to have
a keyboard for example with with the

18
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,060
forum people have compulsive
relationship with former mean you keep

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,300
switching off the screen on and off in
an office or if every time you do this

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,950
you are required to pass where the
people get very annoyed so this is the

21
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,959
kind of of context we have as a
reference if you look at what is the

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,020
technology or what is really the most
widely technologies today for 10 tickets

23
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,860
on this on this device computer
passwords I think this is the right

24
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:43,500
crowd to ask you know when completed
possible we're introducing by who is the

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,180
password

26
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:05,379
now before ok so working on one of the
first time sharing system at MIT in the

27
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:13,399
sixty there they were meant for the kind
of device the times although I used some

28
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,200
sort of velvety 100 this year there the
keyboard is predominant so you have this

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,879
technology that was invented for this
kind of environment where you indicate

30
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,099
once then you have a long session and
then you go home and now how you

31
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:38,069
transfer to describe how you can use
these kind of mechanism in something

32
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:44,700
like a SmartWatch so there is a mismatch
between

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,980
technical mismatch however what is
interesting here is not only that the

34
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:58,910
fact that past 11 not only encourage the
fact that probably are not the best

35
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,690
mechanism but what is my concern is that
probably they do not even implement the

36
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:13,359
right to the right security not always
so not in order environments because

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:22,109
password really were introduced to have
this banner indication the password once

38
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,430
at the beginning of the session and then
you are 100% authenticated or not

39
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:37,440
while this keep you strong and security
no issued making white you are who you

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,340
claim to be or not but is there a
flexible and there are many situations

41
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,310
where you need this possibility for
example there are many services

42
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,850
application whether you want to
implement this talk two principal so

43
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,979
well the time will you check the past
the one where use the password is

44
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:06,469
different now how you implement that
usually by asking periodic intervals to

45
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,479
insert in the past but this is really
annoying to the user and this amount to

46
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,169
the user of the time working the PC in
selenium on foreign soil that they

47
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:24,380
workin on the way to use the problem is
to not implement this kind of principle

48
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,030
or you rely on

49
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:33,020
single sign-on service company so you're
indicate with Facebook that seems to me

50
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,880
like we can you possibly your your
security so even conflicting with the

51
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,300
purpose of having their the possible in
the first place then and there are also

52
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,310
many applications where you want what is
called a risk-based authentication

53
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,320
authentication we're actually the
provider can choose the service provider

54
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,370
can choose the level of confidence that
he wants based on his own criteria so

55
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,240
you may want higher stronger security
less security so you want to play with

56
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,320
that and the fact that sometimes you may
not get out indicating still it's up to

57
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,240
you to choose safe to let the people to
the Service or not now implementing this

58
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,440
with the password is not easy because I
really they're not meant for the so

59
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,650
these are the security challenge then
how we can find some mechanism to

60
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,000
implement the security challenge how we
can find something that is suitable for

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,890
this new generation of device and
possibly get as many advantages of

62
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,810
possible because in fact that we are
using password for fifty years is

63
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,550
because possible have a lot of

64
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:52,540
a lot of good properties ok so decision
if you want the motivation now let's see

65
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,380
in particular how this work on on a
smartphone so as I told you my phone are

66
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,900
placing them in I i said you develop
away my phone at a good that is

67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,750
important you see there is what is
interesting there is an important this

68
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,920
is the age range the very young people
in and the people that use my phone and

69
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,300
actually they are the more subject to
change that that's why I actually

70
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,000
identification still make sense and it's
important web and then I would is

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,500
important also to mention is this if you
go and look inside as much fun thanks to

72
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,030
MEMS your MS technology

73
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,909
plane to your very sophisticated the

74
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:47,330
sensitive for free so unless you really
buy cheap farm like this one you have a

75
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:58,120
very good very good sense so that we can
make use of them for free so say that to

76
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,980
what is now as I said because they use
on the phone mainly been and password

77
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:13,230
now we all know the limitations but as I
said that hero moment for the the real

78
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,620
problem of the pain and the password is
that people cannot be border to use even

79
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,850
possible at all so they not want make
found cumbersome actually they complain

80
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,290
more of the fact that people either the
phone ask the people rather than for

81
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,510
example lack of coverage and this is
reflected actually in in a study

82
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:42,710
released this this guy that analyzed the
3.4 million open and if people you spin

83
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:50,380
it is very easy to to guess being so
people putting just because they're too

84
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,200
but there is no consideration about
their security of the pain of course

85
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,840
there are some some

86
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:06,590
alternately life graphical password
again they did say that this problem

87
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,310
that there are some papers showing that
people use choose a symmetric pattern

88
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,150
and then there is no many choices
actually can mount a brute-force attack

89
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,680
on on

90
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,949
graphical possible but what is even
worse than all of this is that people

91
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,410
simply do not use password so there is a
reporter from Sophos that I think this

92
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,380
is a durable I cannot believe the
seventy percent of people do not use

93
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,930
special but simple people do not use
special so I strong requirement is that

94
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,449
any authentication mechanism must really
be unobtrusive transparent as possible

95
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,870
but it's something it's a strong system
requirement anyway

96
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,580
phone vendors and fracture realized that
person or not i'm not the best solution

97
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:03,010
as a matter of fact they started using
physical biometrics

98
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:13,069
the case for example also today was
showing of such idea now we do physical

99
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,860
with physical by Metro CEO of steel

100
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,020
psychological barrier because he is not
rational but still people seem not to

101
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:30,890
like physical biometrics because it's
more as I said I'd legacy from the past

102
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,710
that really

103
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:40,870
supported by evidence but what is the
problem and the main problem is the

104
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,600
password physical biometrics what well
if you have

105
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:55,800
data collection are good for their hard
work to collect the data not cheap so

106
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:03,490
good quality in the dark to collect the
ratings must be of high quality in that

107
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,519
is not the case for example with the
with the April tragedy because they use

108
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,750
their did the reading of the
fingerprints that he's not a

109
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,430
particularly sophisticated wine and as a
matter of fact it's quite trivial to

110
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:27,489
forge fingerprint and you can try and
very detailed description in the website

111
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,569
of the couch Computer Club so probably
nobody is the problem that you need

112
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:38,769
additional out of the end still not
transparent so we would like to have

113
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:46,519
something that is really transparent if
we can and that's the idea of behavioral

114
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,920
biometrics November biometrics it is not
something to tell the use of biometric

115
00:11:50,920 --> 00:12:00,110
of behavior even in the context of
conventional security is not new but

116
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,800
when we talk about education and this is
now made possible because I say that we

117
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:15,199
are quite reach powerful sensing
platform where you can all do all this

118
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,149
for free so and the people observed that
there is a lot of action that people do

119
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:26,620
are using their own style their own
culture their own strategy in this

120
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:33,480
bizarre behavior and these are actually
good biometrics of course you have to be

121
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,070
careful because you can have biometrics
but above methods to be using insecurity

122
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,829
to be secure so for example you have a
gate the gate instamood biometrics but

123
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:51,370
there are people that actually been the
exoskeleton you can simulate and must be

124
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,950
stable so some people use for example
the ECG bits as a biometrics but then

125
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:03,260
it's not very stable so it's it's it's
it's it's not it's not it's not easy but

126
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:09,740
general manager for just the general
managers they are actually data can be

127
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,399
collected in an unobtrusive way so this
is really something potentially can give

128
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,259
you can satisfy this

129
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:29,309
requirement do not need additional
internal security this is something that

130
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,459
needs to be investigated more about
potentially they can be more secure than

131
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,138
physical beatings because you don't for
example the fingerprint unit races

132
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:45,470
everywhere while they usually you don't
leave the behavior so everywhere so they

133
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:54,329
can also use every legal job of
contention ok now every time we talk

134
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:55,420
about

135
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,640
biometrics people say ok what would
happen if the leader fail if I was car I

136
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,510
mean there is the usability robustness
issues

137
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,460
but people working biometrics actually
they are solving this using a

138
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,950
multimodality sure you have not only
many system you don't have a single

139
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,960
modality but you have more than one is
for example the airport at least two

140
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,960
replacement of passport and modality
Canadian for robustness and accuracy in

141
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,220
the team I'm going to percent actually
we use it for accuracy rather than the

142
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:45,430
robust and okay so what we are proposing
we are proposing this solution that its

143
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:55,770
first it really is making it doesn't
require any action that is specific for

144
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:04,500
authentication is so you used the knife
and cut education is embedded in the

145
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,660
normal usage of the front wheels three
modalities the one is the way in which

146
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,730
you drag and drop

147
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,720
this life to start before then there is
the pickup movements are you bring your

148
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,500
your phone on your area and then how you
answer to the to the call to take this

149
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,100
treatment modality and

150
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,800
what is interesting is that you don't
need a built-in sensor are sufficient

151
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,089
actually to record them that the tax and
collect on the patterns for this

152
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:49,910
modality so we tested to see if you use
but this seems to be good

153
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,100
biometrics and I would have been more
extensive tests and actually this was

154
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,170
confirmed so you have

155
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,490
you can identify different user same
among different classes what we used

156
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:11,070
data sources some physical senses and
desire for the the pickup movement some

157
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:17,240
touchscreen sensor and the microphone so
morning particularly for the peak

158
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,930
improvement we take acceleration and
deceleration in the tribe dimension and

159
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,599
then the time the opposite from when you
started when you finish and finish when

160
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:36,130
the sensor when you're close to the
action stops then the slight movement

161
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,839
the movement taking consideration the
part that you have on the screen to

162
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,870
pressure the pressure is important the
size of the touch and also the time it

163
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:55,100
takes to do the the two unlock and then
from voice voice is this is really a

164
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,040
state of the art nothing nothing you
just who is this because apparently this

165
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:09,010
is the best work the best method for a
very short simple because the boisterous

166
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,199
is not a long discussion but only I
think two seconds over

167
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:24,740
ok what is the validation preliminary
evaluation of 2016 services and

168
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:31,059
we it's it's a control the test so we
explain their mind that the system they

169
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:37,010
know we took this slice pickup movement
and the voice then we make them to do

170
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,090
something else to read the text and then
we repeated the experiment what is

171
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,780
important here is that we tried
different activities for this is

172
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,639
important so the way in which uses phone
converting so you can be CT you can walk

173
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,440
you can being different situation and
the situation matter so it's important

174
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,790
when you do the train so what we
experience is that when you do the

175
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,770
training your to the training
considering the different situation if

176
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,740
you do that for them to fire him quite
well but if you train all in one

177
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,920
situation that you have quite relevant
impact on the classifier if the test is

178
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,429
done on a difference so this is quite
important to take in consideration

179
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:23,360
environment

180
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:34,830
conditions we did you use a one-class
classification so we have we trained

181
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:41,799
only with the day down the owner so the
purpose here is to recognize the owner

182
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,160
of the phone all the other party now you
know to rise much so it's a one-class

183
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:55,520
classification and we stand over
classified share this with that is not

184
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:04,129
strange behavior due to our results in
terms of accuracy is that similar what

185
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,900
is important here is also to consider
performance since we need to implement

186
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,890
this on the phone so for example the
approximate support vector machine are

187
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,650
quite expensive thermal

188
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,850
able to compute so we we simply

189
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:29,500
drop it by saying that performed better
so the results are with the use of

190
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:38,970
Bayesian network then we also use fusion
so well-known technique in order to try

191
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:46,710
to improve accuracy you can do fusion a
different level in this setting which is

192
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,929
to do it

193
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,869
level of a score matching so the
different modality contribute and then

194
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:59,789
when you take the decision it's a it's a
way it's awaited decision and its weight

195
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,559
is based on the accuracy of us seeing
each modality so there are no modality

196
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,249
that are more accurate than others and
they wait more is a way which we compete

197
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:22,019
the way so 0:42 is the the slide moment
that is more accurate 133 East 0:33 is

198
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:28,039
the pickup and the less accurate has
been the voice recognition and just

199
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:33,100
forgot to say when he took the situation
for example the pickup movement fire

200
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:40,379
this is quite sensitive to the situation
so that it's it's something to consider

201
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:47,678
while the touch it's much more robust
because essentially it's much less

202
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:56,470
sensitive to today how you are holding
the device and then we have some some

203
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:05,350
results in some of us are so that the
only model system so we consider the

204
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:13,330
accuracy of each of them actually use
these HTML because we didn't consider a

205
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:21,909
false rejection and false acceptance of
the same cost so we this is number two

206
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,350
choice but to concede they're having a
false reject more important in full

207
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:35,510
force except so I actually it's it's
biased towards the force reject you see

208
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:44,549
the slightest bit better performance
devices is quite is actually it's quite

209
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:51,870
bad as accuracy and then going litigate
this program because the implementation

210
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,620
we had this was not particularly good so
otherwise really difficult to motivate

211
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,590
why it's so so bad but these are the
single modality then used to get there

212
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,080
you can see that just considering slide
and pick up you have

213
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,418
better performance and then if you to
reconsider all the three of them

214
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:15,309
actually you manage to ever even better
performance of their lower number of

215
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:25,389
batteries accuracy higher is the cutest
now the way in which we combine used the

216
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,490
modality actually it's only for accuracy
but not for example for business because

217
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:37,260
here if one without fail the way in
which we combined essentially the

218
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,389
authentication failed but we also have a
system where we use them a different

219
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:51,629
different 11 ok so I think say his
ongoing war just to see and we did the

220
00:22:51,630 --> 00:23:00,289
first round four if it is the the system
can be implemented in modern iPhone and

221
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:05,990
also to get in early feedback from the
user but in order to come with

222
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,470
significant result we really need to
extend the number of users and also

223
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,419
paste is not in a controlled environment
but more on the on the field something

224
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:21,470
that is not easy because she is very
difficult to find collectible some very

225
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,549
expensive

226
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:33,629
activity and also how secure is this so
this is interesting because there is no

227
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:40,590
much they're usually one things usually
when we talk about physical biometrics

228
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:47,110
the robustness sees how the biometric
he's embarrassed

229
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:54,110
attempt to forge the characteristics so
how difficulties for example to replace

230
00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:03,840
the fingerprint here we have a deal in
this for example to try to target attack

231
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,320
so you have that tackled by a person
that can

232
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,100
for example see video of

233
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:19,010
people indicating the possibility to see
in real how people are indicating then

234
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,730
they try to make and see how to bust is
to this kind of attack that it's not on

235
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,630
formal about each and experimental
validation that we found a useful and

236
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,480
then surely usability study we did it
but not in a systematic way and that is

237
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
something that we are doing now

238
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,870
I now now the 25 seconds have left I
like to have some some conclusion here

239
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,459
so they say he's really first step

240
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,390
much more

241
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:54,480
experimental me that but here we are
working on the field that is completely

242
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,480
empty for example you could talk about
physical metal she not get a DNA

243
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:10,550
fingerprint or iris are the
characteristics that works well here we

244
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,540
don't know what that will be able so we
are still scouting what are they be a

245
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,070
little stable and are significant and
being well then there is the next step

246
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:27,530
what are the features that we need to
extract final stable then classifiers

247
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,670
are there some classified the permitted
another home this kind of data again

248
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:38,830
since there is no many many anger over a
lot of work on that if you want to do

249
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,480
validation of comparison there is not a
certain that it's again it's a big issue

250
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,270
if I have to do it on face recognition I
go in there and that debate that set to

251
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:55,960
thousands of images so we are collecting
their time this is very important to

252
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,150
share this data but it's better that are
not easy to do and for example using

253
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,020
crowdsourcing doesn't out there are not
good crowd sourcing their site for

254
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,889
mobile phone so it's really a big big
task and actually the most expensive

255
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:18,270
wine in terms of time and also what is
important to us and we implemented in a

256
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,600
couple for me it's very important to
consider a multimodal dependence because

257
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,250
there are differences in the way in
which sense will be able to motivate

258
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,320
others

259
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:37,809
time to finish this fight but I think
it's a promising promising technology

260
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:47,320
see it's something very transparent it's
not easy we have either metaphor for

261
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:54,019
example integrated with possible and
they work much better and much easier to

262
00:26:54,019 --> 00:27:03,179
yes they're much more stable but I mean
something to aspire to be really really

263
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,059
good

264
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:04,870
okay thank you
