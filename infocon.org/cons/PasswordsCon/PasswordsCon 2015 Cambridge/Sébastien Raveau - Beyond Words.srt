1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:08,810
so hello everyone i'm suppose seemed
like you might have heard of this we

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:15,880
could be aware of this before this time
actually misspelled my first name was

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,369
the best thing like Einstein so I'm
hoping that you're not expecting too

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:33,670
much but so in 2012 it possible to have
presented the evolution from the first

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,210
day we could be aware of is that I
published on my blog in 2009 and thought

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:45,370
of that may be a friend or to read but
never expected that attracts attention

7
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:55,059
and I rooted in 2012 etc but actually
that was not the very first one I did I

8
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:02,108
did 21 a long time ago I think 2004
which was really just me playing in a

9
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:07,420
corner and not thinking of the releasing
that for anyone but it was already

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:14,229
proving very useful and around five
years I thought I really needed to

11
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,400
abated because for example Twitter

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,580
had become a new big thing and my 2000
and all five World least didn't even

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:32,000
have the world to turn it also in the
meantime what had started as Wikipedia

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,540
where mister purely from the Wikipedia
sides it's maintained by the Wikimedia

15
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,870
Foundation which now has hundreds of
sites in each language for example you

16
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,960
can see for the English language is
English Wikipedia that you know but

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,160
there's also which moves we can use week
quote and so on

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,110
for each language so the biggest three
being English French German and French

19
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:05,400
and other big name which is so this one
was still quite quick and dirty very

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,750
simple just cut based on the spaces
penetration that kind of stuff and it

21
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,200
had really a huge amount of entries in
the 58th and a half million of Julie

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,160
alphabetic sequences because if I added
numbers as well done it for the house in

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,609
ridiculous even more ridiculously big
two hundred and thirteen megabytes

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,840
compressed I think uncompressed it's a
textile around seven hundred megabytes

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,380
or something like that so it was really
something that I thought I just put on

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,920
my blog and maybe a friend will you
something but then people at DEFCON

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,660
started using you talking about it
essential and while I really need to do

28
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,109
something about it because it's really
bad when you start looking into it it

29
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,920
was all entertainment unit because when
you're in Wikipedia I think it looks

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,910
quite clean and indeed the biggest pages
with most popular pages so frequently

31
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,140
visited at least someone would try to
displace or vandalized one then quickly

32
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,149
someone else would correct that there's
actually many many

33
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,720
pages that don't get too many visits
where you can just write all kinds of

34
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,159
things and that stage long enough for my
program to pick it up and so in 2012

35
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:36,810
discussed how I was trying to reduce all
that amount of time and then I also

36
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,819
increased largely the number of safety
because the media

37
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:46,399
Media Foundation continued growing in
the meantime so we went from almost 400

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:58,040
to 600 now there's much newer entries on
the 28 million but it's much much better

39
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,388
quality and incense I look forward to
Demetrius talk tomorrow about evaluating

40
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:13,659
the quality of work but at least looking
at it I think it was much better and it

41
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,599
also came with its own compression
algorithm and it wasn't not just a

42
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:24,570
taxpayer anymore but even a program that
you could ask her to filter to get only

43
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,830
Spanish words and for example if you
know that I'm using an English a

44
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,229
keyboard and it's hard for me to type of
French characters so maybe my parcel

45
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:40,250
doesn't have French characters in it so
you can say you're just take the English

46
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,060
keymap and that kind of stuff and also
for WPA you're not allowed all the

47
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:54,889
characters so you can also future
buybacks and continuing on top of that

48
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,039
in 2014

49
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,539
last year was also the conference
everyone was expecting a new list and i

50
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,000
got lol yeah I love her

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,740
not just more updated information in it
but also new features like this is a

52
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,140
slight from the 2012 presentation I hope
you followed the talk yesterday about to

53
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:26,000
the market since I can skip that quickly
but in 2012 it was around the time of

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,070
your selections of Barack Obama vs Mitt
Romney and because he would see so many

55
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,530
posters of Obama for president on Mitt
Romney for president you would imagine

56
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,739
that people would see that outside of
the window into that as a possible

57
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:50,169
problem let's see how I can get to that
as a sentence with the mark of change

58
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:56,250
that area but it's much easier said than
done because meat is also a Scandinavian

59
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,530
words so from Swedish songs and no we
didn't songs it's actually actually goes

60
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,679
quickly in other directions and the top
and also if you're hoping that at least

61
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,460
you have the probability of going
jumping from me to Romney than the third

62
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,810
one

63
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:19,970
Mitt Romney for president it's not even
there yet so that's actually a lot of

64
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,729
work and as you are sending the talk
yesterday it was taking five weeks I

65
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:35,650
think it was for calculating six steps
so in the case of my word list with 38

66
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,469
millions of words or something like that
so I have to compare 38 million the

67
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,400
probability of each 12 connecting to
another one of 38 million the turtles

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,780
grows exponentially it's a big problem
but anyway I thought it was going to be

69
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:57,250
awesome but in practice what I started
noticing was actually in practice it

70
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,780
cracks fewer and fewer passwords

71
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:11,780
really not good so I realized something
like a familiar problem of something

72
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,119
that the more I think about it the worse
it gets

73
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,030
ex-girlfriend cool until you Sebastian
you think too much and I think she's

74
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:31,419
she's right so this is this is a
character from a Belgian comic idea

75
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,250
fortunately have a chance to go to Paris
to scan my own version it's supposed to

76
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:44,500
be in French and Spanish but also that's
why i'm only having those parts but its

77
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,700
site area code that is recurring every
now and then into a series of comics and

78
00:07:50,700 --> 00:08:01,599
all he does is just wondering about
crazy equations etcetera and completely

79
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,720
oblivious to what's happening around him
so sometimes I have to be careful that I

80
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:18,000
don't become like that cuz shopping
clubbing be talking and then finally

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,529
when for the first time she speaks in
those comics

82
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:32,208
I don't speak Spanish but it's basically
I found it it's amazing haha so I have

83
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:37,698
been spending all this time optimizing
my younger than the thirty what's the

84
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:42,659
point of that in the end it's leading to
nothing what's the point if you are a

85
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,089
nuclear physicist having sold over your
crazy questions if you then mistakenly

86
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:57,449
eaten by a vegetarian times or so I
thought you really need to stop

87
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:00,569
overthinking and let's start from
scratch

88
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:12,329
what exactly is a word

89
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:34,449
but I also like how true for me it's
becoming the description there because

90
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:41,878
you have that you would normally
considered just letters etc but you will

91
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:50,259
see you know it's actually letters and
how do you then isolated words if you

92
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:57,009
don't want to take into account the
penetration at all so for example you

93
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:57,819
all know this

94
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:04,410
xkcd comic we quoted in the
presentations and she gives this advice

95
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,339
of creating a passphrase based on
forwards and then there's lots of debate

96
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,929
around it because she defines the
entropy of that being quite high but

97
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:19,980
other people would say 14 english words
in the dictionary I can easily combine

98
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:28,110
them and quickly but the question is are
you sure you really have all the words

99
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:36,589
because the other day XP CDs and former
in Mesa engineer so I imagine that might

100
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:42,579
be what he has normally on his desk has
like about 30 staple using two

101
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:51,549
correctness is it still engineer and
maybe she's into a system so that might

102
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,610
be she's kind of vocabulary but what if
you are

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:01,200
a terrorist very simple and i've seen in
the past as some had even their email

104
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,700
address was she had to sit on which is
French for 911 and you think I what they

105
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,450
already have that opposition in even the
name of their email address what do they

106
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,880
put in the password so maybe they will
put 911 than the type of aircraft one of

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:29,310
the two planes that crashed in the world
trade center and then I munition of

108
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,550
choice for terrorists would be her 762
further but you'll see that I find this

109
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,880
other dude 49 Western even better
example because it's really difficult to

110
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,760
make her computer understand that this
is a words by itself because you see it

111
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,120
has a daughter at the beginning and
ampersand in the middle of the second

112
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,350
words and space in the middle and to the
last parties

113
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,709
well why not make it christian
terrorists with a quote the most famous

114
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:12,149
passage from the Bible so as I was
saying this but participation in the

115
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,320
Western the country but just two parts
from the Wikipedia article about this

116
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:26,420
ammunition as you can see in the
beginning the word itself is not in the

117
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,839
beginning of the center's not in the
middle either but somewhere in the

118
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,060
middle but then in the second entry it's
starting with a dot at the end it's at

119
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,420
the very end of the sentence but you
still have to make your program

120
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,349
understand that at the end of the
sentence is not part of the world as the

121
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,610
thought before the forties so

122
00:12:52,610 --> 00:13:05,070
i buy a better word I thought well why
not call these more complicated words I

123
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,850
don't want to call them complex words
because then we might confuse them with

124
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,070
complex passwords and they're not but
they're more complicated than regular

125
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:22,600
words that that's what I referred to is
beyond words there was a presentation in

126
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,899
other possible to conferences before
about the new tool called the world

127
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,790
hounds and it's great to that so you can
use to build your own wordless essential

128
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,760
but it's doing what I was doing at the
beginning

129
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,760
cutting based on this basis and creation
and that kind of stuff so how do you not

130
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,089
take this approach and try to zone in on
this word in the middle of a sentence

131
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:59,040
without knowing anything about what's
the handing over we're so in the upper

132
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:07,959
left for example we have a past let's
say that is looking at each sequence of

133
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:15,339
46 bytes and it's in red because it has
no chance of zoning in on 2012 because

134
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:22,160
it's seven characters so it's in red
then operate its in yellow when it's

135
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,829
just before or just after on it

136
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:31,910
green one it's really on it and the rest
also is 89 by tutors no chance of zoning

137
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:36,260
in on to that particular weather of
course it will find the words that eight

138
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,439
or nine characters

139
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:56,620
so if we look at what is actually
surrounding each of these sequences so I

140
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,390
did a little taste of that from the page
itself it's a try and you can see on the

141
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:13,100
left if you look at the sequence that is
just before the top 40 Smith and Wesson

142
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,810
ammunition you will see that it's not
stable at all on the left it's being

143
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:26,469
preceded by all kinds of different
characters and then the last of the

144
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,260
following characters is always aw while
on the right side to have the opposite

145
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,950
that it's only ever preceded by a box
and it's all up by all kinds of

146
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,950
different characters however in the
middle

147
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:48,790
it's fairly stable that it's either
space or quotes for a dot on the same

148
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:57,650
but it overall is abandoned for this 77
character sequence when you are right

149
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:06,150
you know so that I this is working great
good I will now spend a lot of time into

150
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:12,040
Canada hacking into located the voice of
memory continuously process of Wikipedia

151
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,969
to try to find all the unique sequences
of

152
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,689
seven characters 89 and so on and look
into renting Amazon Services effort to

153
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:29,920
do that that's going to be awesome but I
started getting the first results

154
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:39,439
actually you find that when you look at
the ninth character sequence so you find

155
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:47,569
stable sequence the same word doc 49
Western with their space at the

156
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:52,290
beginning of the end so that was good to
mention but the white fraternities are

157
00:16:52,290 --> 00:17:01,939
true show this basis so they are
prefixed preceded by all kinds of

158
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,928
characters on the left all kinds of
characters on the right especially so

159
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:12,900
this method of trying to isolate this
particular sequence by itself is not

160
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:24,740
working so far and then I thought sorry
get back to that I need a better way

161
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:31,549
because as humans we can obviously see
that there's a word in there or content

162
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:37,870
beyond words that is repeated many times
throughout the page so just buy a glance

163
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,310
at the page you can decide that

164
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:51,110
it's actually not 40 S&W it's beyond
words by itself so I thought maybe it's

165
00:17:51,110 --> 00:18:01,100
this thing so you're familiar with
computer vision and since those kind of

166
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,270
price already starting to look like
neural networks I thought maybe your

167
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,680
network problem and follow the earlier
in the summer of Google released list

168
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,300
the latest advances

169
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,710
going deeper into neural networks were
they are trying to teach their machines

170
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,330
basically how to recognize dogs from not
necessarily having the perfect training

171
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,820
set to say well this is all kinds of
dogs that are possible so they are

172
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,679
basically taking all of Google Images
and letting the machine trying to figure

173
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,250
it out myself which is sort of like what
I'm trying to do with giving it which

174
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:48,090
apt and not telling it what exactly
where this but as you can see that's the

175
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,919
same state of the art of the Google
research itself which has lots of clever

176
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,430
people a lot of time and it still finds
dogs absolutely everywhere in the

177
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:05,190
preacher and windows of the horse and in
the helmet of the night it's so that's

178
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,960
when I realized okay maybe I'm
overthinking again

179
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:21,360
let's drop all of that and just see what
happens if I just keep it simple stupid

180
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,029
to review station explosively principal
and just wipe out all the output of my

181
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:38,890
only program to cut all kinds of sixty
currencies from Wikipedia and I started

182
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:46,440
cracking all of these from LinkedIn for
example and that's the first thing I

183
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,840
noticed this if you see it's hard to say
what the person meant to have as a

184
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,928
pastor of course it when it's exactly 16
characters or maybe there's a on the

185
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:05,309
boundary of words so you don't know if
it was supposed to be longer but there's

186
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:11,840
many of them for example I can
accelerate in the second column at the

187
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,139
top it should have been excellence so
you know there's something happening

188
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,799
here and I don't know if this is
something that is being done already in

189
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:31,429
all the tracking tools but you have so
many websites that at least used to

190
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,740
force you to have a password

191
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,500
smaller than their fixed coincides in
their database when they were still are

192
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,730
storing up us with nuclear text or if
they didn't tell you they would just

193
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,820
silently truncate your password

194
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:56,760
216 votes in this case for example of
the leading and every time maybe you

195
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,560
will be typing academic excellence

196
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,159
Alice in Wonderland and so on but
concretely what's happening is that its

197
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,120
truncated and that's only that parts
that is harsh so for example last year

198
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:20,120
from item from her she was talking about
his medals of Prince loads to create

199
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,229
Associated words together to do I care
correct course patrice table and you

200
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:33,850
have to keep in mind that you might have
to cut the last part to fit that kind of

201
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,909
model and also noted that I wrote two
bites are supposed to characters even if

202
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:47,220
I sometimes maybe I should really
distinguish the two it's because it's 16

203
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:55,650
characters if you're only using English
characters but in a Unicode of course

204
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:02,000
to support all the languages French
accents and everything

205
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,190
Chinese and you a movie theater which
character can take between one and six

206
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:15,200
points so when its truncated at 16 bytes
and choosing a pass for the in language

207
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,960
that is using complex longer characters
maybe your password is actually on the

208
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,990
three or four characters in the database
so another thing I noticed is I came

209
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,840
across this and I thought that well how
did we get here it looks like one of my

210
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,980
old passwords so was panicked for a
moment and then couldn't it wasn't my

211
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,010
whole Linkedin password so I could look
for it and I found it in the middle of

212
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:54,500
other exhibition about them so I still
have trouble understanding how someone

213
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,320
shows that as a person maybe they just
copy pasted randomly from something but

214
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:08,590
at least it showing a user tracking
passes by just keeping it simple but to

215
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:15,090
you would have otherwise had their
really trouble so sure remember the

216
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,980
title of my first lights in the
beginning with the words I was very

217
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,920
proud of that because one of the first
things I practice 129 the letters

218
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,290
password that is actually a real person
and I thought they were perfect title

219
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:38,659
from my presentation accepted then
looking back at those stuff at all I

220
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,570
came across this showing that it was
also practice within 24 hours

221
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:52,779
in 2012 when a LinkedIn which came out
so disappointed but still as you can see

222
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:59,029
in the bottom right I cracked up to
forty two characters but they make a

223
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:07,090
great point of using the Bible to see
beyond the Wikipedia what you can put in

224
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,259
it so I said well let's see what happens
if I put a lot of Wikipedia follow the

225
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:20,340
Bible in my new simple pricing thing and
then you find all of these complex

226
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,580
beyond words for testing purposes
because they are quite easy to crack and

227
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,289
as you noticed in the upper left those
who says hansel and therefore puts hand

228
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:49,560
solo doing in the Bible

229
00:24:49,560 --> 00:25:24,030
but also some people are likely to have
this week I dot com sites it's not part

230
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:29,560
of their wiki Wikimedia Foundation sites
that I was processing so far but it's

231
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,230
still the same sort of the same kind of
database official so I felt a let's take

232
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,600
all of Star Wars and see what I can find
and you can see there's lots of

233
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:46,820
responsibility then somewhere in there

234
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:55,889
the top second kilometres I'll be back
which I guess is somewhere in stores but

235
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:02,320
for me it's about time they talk so I
thought day let's take not only movies

236
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,570
from week to week but let's take all the
subtitled that I can find on the

237
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,389
internet and they're very small science
so now you start tracking your lots

238
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,640
longer passwords that are

239
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:29,080
streams of consciousness as you can see
her for example the shoes of course I am

240
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:36,050
on holiday so I have to go faster and
other source of a stream of

241
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,409
consciousness is so from tutoring you
can

242
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:46,180
get to full seeds of everything that's
public etc but you have to pay for

243
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:52,010
school before your host but you can also
get several gigabytes per day just as a

244
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:59,050
developer who you register for free and
do you can use the second so again in

245
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:04,450
this idea of people choosing passwords
the way they think in their heads

246
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:11,280
you can see they these are real tweets
that there could be wasted that help me

247
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,820
track what's highlighted in green so
some people indict in their possible

248
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,929
ways I always forget my password I
should remember I need a vacation it's

249
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:31,470
so these are real postulates that you
very quickly with

250
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:38,460
so if I did turns out why not IRC so
that's also cracking other things and

251
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:45,090
then I started to see those ones and
many others have to manually picture

252
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:51,449
several common to all of these from
Wikipedia Twitter IRC the subtitles a

253
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,289
total of their peer everywhere

254
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:58,460
however he cracked a lot faster on the
smaller ones like Twitter and I S II

255
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,250
where it's a more human talk that know
what you find in Wikipedia where it's a

256
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:09,650
very formal but talking in general as
opposed to what you are thinking in your

257
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:17,200
head it's really the first person on
Wikipedia

258
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,710
that's the and basically so

259
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:30,600
so everybody this presentation I'm sorry
if you are expected to bring you all

260
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,500
some crack or something you know that's
but as opposed to that it's some ideas

261
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:44,669
that I haven't been brainstorming alone
in my head and I need help basically you

262
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:50,980
are more than welcome to suggest ideas
etc and so for example one thing that I

263
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,299
think we could do soon that would
already improved that is fine some

264
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:01,799
possible optimization in the way we hold
those passwords to allow for this

265
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:10,740
tracking using a huge biplane like the
fire hose so for example the first one

266
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,070
is if you are familiar with CRC you can
actually completed the next one by

267
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,110
subtracting the previous one but that's
probably not possible with more complex

268
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,010
hashes by the fire and decrypt and that
kind of stuff but at least we could do

269
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:31,340
some optimizations of calculating
perhaps all the ashes of 189 up to 40

270
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,949
and so on

271
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:38,460
characters in one go by using the update
function and but there's also a lot of

272
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,679
other interesting properties of the
languages like this is slow

273
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,050
you have to read more about that but
overall

274
00:29:50,050 --> 00:30:01,040
security conference there is the one
thing you can take from this is that yes

275
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,720
do not use apostrophes that might have
been written anywhere everywhere because

276
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:18,710
look at all of these those out insecure
passports so those are all three

277
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:25,410
LinkedIn passwords but I have cracked so
and you can see there sort of complex so

278
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:32,650
you think they would have been stronger
try actually they were quickly so

279
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:39,620
comply with demands I have included a
kitten and I welcome any question
