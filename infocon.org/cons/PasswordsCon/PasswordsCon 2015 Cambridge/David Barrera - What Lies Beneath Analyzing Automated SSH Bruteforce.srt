1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:12,580
so severe he represents work we have my
co-authors Abdul and Paul they're

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,750
looking at Carleton University and I'm
currently a postdoc at ETH Zurich

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,029
there's sort of a side project a deal
with them over the past year

4
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:25,859
ok so secure shell so if you never heard
of this gonna get you up to speed so you

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,849
know everything you need to know to
understand the rest of this service work

6
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:36,260
so secure shell is is a protocol thats
used to perform logins to remote servers

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,760
and disk can recover an unsecured
network and typically is used for system

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,690
system administration but there's a lot
of different applications can be built

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,540
on top of this age so you can for
example tunnel other protocols over this

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,570
product over this protocol and it sort
of governed by a number of our overseas

11
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,400
and everything from key exchange modes
transport protocol

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,239
key management degeneration certificate
management all these things are defined

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,820
in different artists is but it's a it's
an open standard which means that

14
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,570
anybody can implement their own client
and server implementations and therefore

15
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,750
there is a bunch of implementations for
different operating systems pretty much

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,970
every way you can think of

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,640
will have some some way to use this very
popular when I get picture of it here

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,110
it's an Asus age which is about by the
BSE foundation and this is the the

19
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,130
center one of the they put a lot of
distributions so setting up one of these

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,670
things is pretty easy even for
non-technical people you can just go in

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:40,040
and type some some simple commands and
this will get your get your SSH server

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,370
up and running some time table by
default if you buy something like

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,700
an embedded router something like this
to come with these servers enabled by

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:56,340
default and they're listening on TCP
port 22 so I guess that's a no for its

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,970
age but if but if you've heard about
this and you're like ok well maybe

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,170
manage my system remotely or do
something something like that you should

27
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,250
is pretty easy then then what you do is
you you you set it up and then what you

28
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,970
get is something that looks kind of like
this if anybody's everybody's lives this

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,270
may not seem to unfamiliar basically
there's just kind of like this flood

30
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,690
login attempts that this keep appearing
if you look at the data of this disc if

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,310
I did a study just two days ago and one
of the servers that I that I have access

32
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,910
to so this is a pervasive consistent
problem people trying to break into two

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,660
major rivers all over the place

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,400
so these long trials are kind of a new
sense because if you're trying to figure

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
out anything about your system and you
open up a lot of file and they're sort

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,400
of moving this way with so much
information when I get into useful data

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,970
out of it's kind of annoying to be
seeing these things going going going

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,100
through your screen so I'm gonna see if
you've ever seen when you log files on

39
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,420
your break down what the contents are so
that's another and a screenshot from

40
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,119
from taking recently so these logs
contain a call I'm telling you what the

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,410
source IP address of that login attempt
was on your server they're also gonna

42
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,620
tell you what the time samples for the
log file and then what the user name

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,700
that's the remote party attacker
adversary whatever tried to try to guess

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,859
on your system

45
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,080
know there are no passwords and these
logs and has a good reason for that

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,890
because if you maybe you type your
password or something you don't want

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,779
that password

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:38,440
showing up inside your logs and if you
look online this is a pretty common

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,079
problem for a lot of people sort of
empirically we know that these attacks

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,880
are pretty annoying and they're they're
very frequent

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,230
we know that route is is a very targeted
account as i shouldnt those logs most

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,310
attempts were going to towards the root
user name probably because it's the most

53
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,350
rewarding account once you have a
production assistant you can I do a

54
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,700
bunch of other different different
things and and the source IP address

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,140
these attackers are also pretty
diversity there's no sort of rhyme or

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,739
reason for why they come from a certain
part of the world are certain IP address

57
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,090
space they seem to come from everywhere
you go online try to figure out a

58
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,060
solution to this problem you'll find a
lot of kind of what we call a store

59
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,988
clerk in the paper

60
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,580
advice on how to deal with these things
and everybody has their own ideas on how

61
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,150
to deal with I'm sure a lot of you have
dealt with from have certain certain

62
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,940
ideas on how to deal with us some
solutions have the software that

63
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,080
monitors these log files and why certain
number of connections are received a lot

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,780
of firewall rule 22 your firewall to
block future connections from that

65
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,630
source so these are sort of stop-gap
measures that that that you can you can

66
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,430
do so in this hot what I want what I
want to go over as I want to just talk

67
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,540
about some doing some research into
space and what what our objectives are

68
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,540
and I'll talk about how we try to try to
do this and then was gonna give you some

69
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,020
highlights of the research results that
we found from from this data on

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,620
passwords given to the theme of the
conference so our objective is to

71
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,870
analyze automated as his brute force
attacks and it's important that this

72
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,510
this automated but i think is a key part
of this because there's always gonna be

73
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,050
cases of somebody targeting an organ
organization or user specifically and

74
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,330
this might be a more complex more
difficult to to to make it attack

75
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,770
somebody knows something about your
organization or your personally they may

76
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,000
be able to get your password easier but
here we want to focus on this sort of

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,500
this sort of you know a shotgun approach
it just trying to break into everything

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,350
and see what sticks so we try to get
these guys are having a tax and we we

79
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,500
want to look at the passwords are using
these

80
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,040
attacks as well to see if we can try to
uncover some of the more subtle

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,870
behaviors that attackers are doing maybe
if maybe if we understand how the bad

82
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,770
guys are operating maybe we can propose
some better better defenses ok so I

83
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,750
methodologies gonna be as follows we're
going to set up a bunch of its a

84
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,400
server's I have no valid account on them

85
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,429
ok so anybody who tries to log into the
servers is going to fail there's no I

86
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,430
know honey pot so we don't really want
to let people log in and then see what

87
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,790
they're doing we just want to see what
user names and passwords they're they're

88
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,610
trying and this kind of scopes our
schools our research suggests that

89
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,169
timing and what password museums or if
they're they're trying we're so I gotta

90
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,150
go again we're gonna log in the password
is well then the idea that we're going

91
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,239
to analyze this data and then we can
solve this problem for everybody ok but

92
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,140
turns out after after we start playing
this data which are not to sort of I

93
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,000
cover more and more weird things and we
were really able to to solve this

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,780
problem yet so I'm going to present the
findings your passwords and maybe let

95
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,549
some of you guys then go ahead and sell
the problem may be at next year's

96
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,140
conference

97
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:03,090
SSH servers were instrumental our guest
password so I showed him those log files

98
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,159
passwords don't show up and there's no
configuration option that you can set up

99
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,640
on a stage to login passwords Thursday
design choice that they made to prevent

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,750
people from accidentally turning this on
and then sort of I in the privacy of our

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,630
users or something so we had to do is
modify the source code to the open SSH

102
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,800
daemon and you had a lot of enjoyed a
little dog thing it says the password

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,190
when you receive it so we rebuild a
minute we run this and now we're sort of

104
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,790
worried about ethics as well

105
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,150
and so where we don't we want to prevent
somebody who for example typos and IP

106
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,669
address from putting in their pastor
into a system accidentally so we want to

107
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,270
just basically target exclusively
automated attempts so we just played

108
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,330
this banner prior to login

109
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,200
prior to requesting using the password
in hopes that somebody who accidentally

110
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,460
type something in types and IP address
in the hit one of our servers they don't

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,900
end up revealing their passwords I mean
is this very important that I think if

112
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,440
you doing this kind of work like you
want to try to minimize the chance that

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,969
a user might accidentally their pressure
on the long trials once we have to look

114
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,490
as look as follows

115
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,500
so we we take these attempts come in and
so we have the same log line clogging

116
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,100
the guessing attempt and then we are
with the next line is you know this is a

117
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,760
chalk line that shows us the route that
was the attempted to pass but it was

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,620
attempted to look at this particular
screenshots you can see some some ideas

119
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,140
of what we're going to be seeing in
these laws which is for example here

120
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,049
there the attackers as always this 1032
41 died 124 255 and they're trying all

121
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,089
these past with the start with with the
letter j and then some dictionaries is

122
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,160
going to have the kind of intuition we
want to get from this work

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:56,589
ok so we wanted to to do two of two
types of two types of studies show one

124
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,590
was a long-term data collection period
that we've lasted over a year so we had

125
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,610
one virtual one instrument virtual
machine running for a long time and then

126
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,010
we had five short term virtual machines
running

127
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,740
over just say you were more than
two-month period they really want to do

128
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,570
is you want to compare whether the
results whether the attempted we

129
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,870
observed a small small time study also
apply to long-term and vice versa

130
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,040
and then 25 short-term being who also
distribute them across the world to see

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,400
if there was any particular geographical
influences of of those servers as well

132
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,540
so so the long-term p.m. was in Ottawa
and then we have the 5 p.m. bus were

133
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:42,219
located in San Francisco New York London
Amsterdam Singapore and fat penguin is

134
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,970
in Ottawa because he collected more than
the other ones so decided to set to give

135
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,160
you an overview of fuel for what kind of
data we've got so we will log over this

136
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,060
entire data collection period over all
of GM's wheel of a total of 17 million

137
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,900
over 17 million total getting attempts
these came from just over six thousand

138
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,470
different source IP's located all over
the world and in 12 countries we saw

139
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,170
2000 almost 20,000 distinct user names
and we collected but one point four

140
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,530
million distinct passwords it is just
what we saw over the whole set in the

141
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,890
paper we break this down based on the
different different GM's in different

142
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:28,540
locations and talk about some timing
analysis just give you a feel for what

143
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,390
you can expect to see if you could have
one of these p.m. yourself and then I'll

144
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,610
dive into the password stuff came so for
timing analysis so we have a couple of

145
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,330
different ways to bring this data down
but I think the highlights here are as

146
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,570
follows there wasn't a single day that
went by and we're at where AVM saw no

147
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,120
login attempts at least so the minimum
login attempts for breach p.m. was at

148
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,280
least 180 and we had a maximum 273,000
attempts in a single day this is may

149
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,490
perhaps I should these VMs had no DNS
entry anywhere they go forward or

150
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,800
reverse DNS they were not advertised
anywhere these were just fresh IP

151
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,510
addresses and even even in that case
were receiving all of his attempts the

152
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,540
Ottawa p.m. got hit the hardest I think
overall

153
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,579
and we saw that this this one is in one
hour on june fourteenth received over

154
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,720
85,000 attempts in a single hour that's
24 long attempts per second of these

155
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:35,610
things will fill up your log files very
very quickly the European GM's seem to

156
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,740
receive more stable sort of rate of
attempts to the head they didn't have a

157
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,870
spiky connections as the Singapore or
the american GM's so maybe there's some

158
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,880
sort of IDS thing going on with the
European backbone networks or maybe

159
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,040
they're just more and more aware of what
the

160
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,849
clients and those areas are doing but
the European p.m. seem to receive the

161
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:06,220
sort of sort of more stable distribution
and we have those those who didn't go so

162
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,630
I'm gonna trees and graphs here so on
the left we have the Ottawa p.m.

163
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:18,480
attempts per day and on the right we
have sort of attempts per minute for the

164
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,170
other p.m. so I'll start with the left
with the left hand side of the picture

165
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,949
so a couple of interesting points here
so the first two spikes around May and

166
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,819
June these ones were done by a single
source IP address to a single source for

167
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:38,000
this p.m. pretty hard and the
interesting thing is that these sources

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,310
only came did did all these gases and
then went away we never saw them again

169
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,829
over the whole data collection period to
different sources came once tried a

170
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,800
whole bunch of different login attempts
that went away when they never came back

171
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,689
there's another spike in November late
late November and this one was a more

172
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,639
distributed spike we're about fifty five
different source IP addresses all

173
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,950
participated in the same the same

174
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,790
source the same destinations for this
interesting things like this where

175
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,680
sometimes you see you are distributed
you see these attacks being a being more

176
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,790
distributed sometimes even being just a
single a single IP somewhere just doing

177
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,730
doing this on their own

178
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,770
now let's focus on the right side of the
picture now for the short term of yams

179
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,180
and so here we try to see if it gets
into action for what's the time to the

180
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,120
first login

181
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,550
guests on one of those PM's so we saw we
saw that basically putting all these up

182
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,550
at the same time at 12:30 and it took 51
minutes to receive the first attempt on

183
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,160
the new york p.m. and the Singapore p.m.
took about 20 for four and a half hours

184
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,600
to see the first attempt and behaviour I
kind of interesting 1 seed PM's are

185
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,160
discovered we see sort of a flood of
attempts come in and sort of go to the

186
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,670
thousands of requests for a minute and
then and then later kinda tapers off and

187
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,339
then the login attempts of sort of our
more person to at the rest of the

188
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,360
collection period of AC when they
discovered it's like everybody swarms to

189
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,430
try to do as many as they can before I
guess the admin realizes this and start

190
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,510
simple and some other some other
measures

191
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,510
right and so just some by doing some
statistical confidence in our data we

192
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,800
find that if you set up a new a new
openness its server with 90% probability

193
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,130
you're going to be seeing between 6,000
and 24,000

194
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,910
getting attempts per day ok this is what
you should expect to see if you set up

195
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,240
your own your own server somewhere ok
there's a lot more details about this

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,940
timing South friend and I encourage you
to go take a look alright so for the

197
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,580
second half let's let's focus on on
password so as a reminder we were

198
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,930
logging the password that we saw during
these guessing attempts in addition to

199
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:01,870
all the normal getting blog properties
so I'll just show you very briefly this

200
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,030
is what we observe as a top passwords
now there's been prior work in this in

201
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,410
this space where they have come up with
these are the top as what you see and I

202
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,530
think this is kind of cool but I don't
think it tells us very much if we just

203
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,540
see the top passwords we can do very
much without so what we do is we

204
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,640
compared it to other elite password data
sets that we find in the wild so for

205
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,920
example the iraqi you data set as these
top house where they're going and we saw

206
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,530
a lot of password and are said that are
not included in the Rocky dataset and

207
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,329
possibly this is due to his age being
sort of a more technical more system

208
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,330
administration thing but one of our
intuitions was that attackers would take

209
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,070
leaked data sets in and just take these
passwords and then dump them into their

210
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,580
own wordless we don't think this is the
case we think that people who are

211
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,020
attacking us a sage servers are creating
their own password lists by some other

212
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,730
mechanism but they're not really using
the league password assets from you know

213
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,880
Yahoo passwords or

214
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,950
Ashley Madison or whatever rocky

215
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:15,750
ok so some some some

216
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,050
a password length so we saw passwords of
all kinds of links all the way from

217
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,750
passwords of length 0 which basically
just read the username and password

218
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,340
all the way to passwords greater than
200 characters and so this is sort of

219
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:35,320
the distribution and here in this graph
showing the number of passwords and the

220
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,200
number of guesses that we saw for
passwords of that length and so these

221
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,310
distributions kind of follow each other
the most popular links were six seven

222
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,099
and eight characters and we also note
more passwords of that length is a

223
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,480
little speak at length 32 not sure why
that is anybody has a 32

224
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,820
there's a there's so many taking a hash
something and then begin using out of

225
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,310
the password and we also some passwords
over a hundred characters in this was

226
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,050
kind of weird to us we said well who
would have a hundred character password

227
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,899
so we investigate a little more what
were those passwords be found some

228
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,189
pretty funny things which may hint at
like maybe miss configuration on the

229
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:23,550
attacker side so so this is why I'm
missing three different passwords here

230
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,409
of passwords over a hundred characters
and if you see what the first one is

231
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,180
like Falcon policy fallible so these are
all words that start with that and so

232
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,430
maybe the line breaks in the password
file weren't set correctly and so he

233
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,230
just took whatever and then try to send
us that until like the buffers were were

234
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,020
full

235
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,520
so obviously that password is that seems
like a misconfiguration aside and we did

236
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,110
see a lot of hands of Lake not a lot of
sophistication on the types of passwords

237
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,340
were being used a lot of areas like this
seems to be an error we also saw what

238
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,370
looks like a UNIX shadow entry being
tried as the password

239
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,729
22 system so hard to say where they're
getting these passwords from but they're

240
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,600
clearly not sanitizing their words are
just like taking whatever they can and

241
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:14,159
sending it and see if it sticks so ok
password composition so again as

242
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,730
compared to the rocky data said we have
kind of a similar distribution of

243
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,520
passwords with and without special
characters it's rock you but that's

244
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,139
about it the rest we have significantly
more passwords that are only lowercase

245
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,060
we have fewer pass but that only
uppercase and then maybe the letters and

246
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,190
then put letters followed by numbers are
also pretty pretty calmly attempted by

247
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:46,020
by attackers so not really sure what
else to say about this i mean this week

248
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,420
I we we we really try to believe that
these passwords are not related to the

249
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:59,450
same to the same type of data sets that
we see some of these web web leaks we

250
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:06,070
saw some passwords that were constructed
as well look as you are else and I think

251
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,020
people who vandalized Iraqis have also
seen pass with it looks like you are

252
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,950
else not sure what's going on there but
they're trying some some URL as as the

253
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,580
password

254
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,960
we saw what three thousand of these you
are like passwords

255
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,740
kind of weird

256
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:27,920
ok so password list sharing so to gain
some insight to see if if attackers were

257
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,750
maybe pooling their resources are
sharing passwords amongst each other or

258
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,030
maybe this review their attack we look
at the literature and try to see how how

259
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,780
are there how are the people doing this
so there's a paper bioinformatics in

260
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,250
2008 that a similar type of analysis and
they said okay if a password or username

261
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,940
and password pair are seeing the same
order from different sources that will

262
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,070
say they're sort of you know sharing
this this password list but we had

263
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,950
significantly more password and
significantly more user names and dated

264
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,670
so we had to come up with our own
methodology to try to make sense of of

265
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:06,100
the stand-up and we came up with a with
a visualization approach shows a lot of

266
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,149
information embedded in these in this
heat maps by damage had a breakdown

267
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:16,640
short of what these are so so what we
did is we built her source IP

268
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,720
dictionaries by looking at all the
passwords that we're seeing used by a

269
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,290
specific source ok so each source has
has a dictionary and because they were

270
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,670
just too many of them we sort of trying
to get them at the network boundary so

271
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,280
every / 24 all the past it was seen by a
host in that / 24 will pull together as

272
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,700
a single password set and then we we put
those on the on the X&Y axes and that

273
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,640
point on this heat map the shooting of
that point tells us what percent overlap

274
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,170
there was between a password in one of
the one of the points on the x-axis and

275
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,090
a point on the y axis is a purple being
that being a hundred percent overlap and

276
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,490
we can see this sort of diagonal going
from the bottom left to the top-right

277
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,710
you would have a hundred percent match
when you compare this to itself but when

278
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,559
you're comparing to different sources
you might see a different different type

279
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,250
of shedding so I think there's there's a
lot to see and we spent weeks and weeks

280
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,929
is looking at this picture in trying to
find like interesting things from about

281
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,000
this picture in the paper

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,330
talks and talks about some examples and
I want to focus on just a couple so if

283
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,980
you know there's some there's some
banding between

284
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,410
around here

285
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:33,410
house so there's a ban toi iPad point
like 1.93 points 32 there's some there's

286
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,250
a white man going up in a wide angle
across so white means that there's no

287
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,390
overlap between passwords in this
sources said and any thing else in this

288
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,240
so this sources using pretty unique
passwords compared to everybody else and

289
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,800
we further investigated this we found
that there was 15 hosts there were using

290
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,480
exactly 500 passwords and what it what
appeared to have happened is the

291
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,970
attacker had built a big dictionary and
then split up into chunks of five

292
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,390
hundred and then giving each one of
these chunks to one of the sources so

293
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,820
they didn't have any overlap between
each other and have overlap between

294
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:15,560
on as compared to any other attackers in
our dataset so sometimes there are

295
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,030
situations by distributing the work this
way and and then there is the most the

296
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,860
most notable one is this the same circle
on the top right

297
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,560
break big overlap between a lot of
different sources to a lot of different

298
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,830
emotions are sent and here we think is
happening is this is probably attack

299
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,800
tool that comes a default password list
and then everybody sort of running it

300
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,550
and configuration and so there's
something like a hundred passwords in

301
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:45,460
the set and then we see them used by a
bunch of different sources about 400

302
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,780
different sources actually from this
from this picture and then you can baby

303
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:54,360
pig at any point on the on the map and
find a story about it but this kind of

304
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,770
shows us that passwords are not that I
think the predominant orange and purple

305
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,750
shading of this figure shows us that
passwords a larger deposits are pretty

306
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,810
much free used by a lot of the attackers
and it is a few exceptions where there's

307
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,269
some

308
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:11,499
some very unique password attackers

309
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:15,539
ok

310
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:21,219
passwords so I just briefly go through
those so most most of these gases

311
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:26,419
targeted to root or Atman account
specifically but 37% of source IP

312
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:30,459
addresses never tried two guest passes
on that side so I think guess is that

313
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,029
were coming forward

314
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:36,249
yes but then there was some attackers
were trying to get some low privileged

315
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:42,599
accounts with more probability we also
saw guess is where the user name was

316
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,939
equal to the password in this is a
pretty pretty common pretty calm and gas

317
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,349
and we also there's some really strange
behavior of attackers read guessing the

318
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:56,439
same password on the same victim p.m.
more than once so about a third of all

319
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,359
gases were repeated guesses which leads
us to believe that attackers aren't

320
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,439
keeping state of whether an attack
against succeeded or failed and this is

321
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,469
interesting because this means that
there may be just banning everybody and

322
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:15,289
then trying to get over and over again
there was one case where one specific

323
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:21,190
source tried the same username and
password para this route in 2001 on the

324
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,619
same p.m. 1200 times in 19 minutes so I
don't know what they were trying to do

325
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,829
but obviously just keep getting the same
the same username password wasn't going

326
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:35,499
to succeed within a 90 minute period of
time but I do want to encourage you to

327
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,139
sign it and send it seems interesting
from this from the stock go take a look

328
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:42,918
at the paper there's a lot more analysis
and there we have using announces

329
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:44,479
distribution of IP's

330
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:50,779
we have IP addresses as a ratio of total
IP application for country so we can

331
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:56,229
find the most malicious countries we
have the consequences of changing your

332
00:24:56,229 --> 00:25:00,269
stage name into a different port which
is common advice and we have some some

333
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:03,769
ideas of whether that works or not
there's another coup heat map and

334
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,669
there's some recommendations then we can
give system administrators based on data

335
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:11,679
that we observed that might be a little
more insightful and just saying hey you

336
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,330
know

337
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,220
turn on public key authentication and go
down so now cases this may not always be

338
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,269
used a solution for everybody ok so I'll
take some questions do says thank you as

339
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:24,860
well

340
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,178
from from Canada and my Twitter in my
email and his email so thank you for

341
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:29,399
your time
