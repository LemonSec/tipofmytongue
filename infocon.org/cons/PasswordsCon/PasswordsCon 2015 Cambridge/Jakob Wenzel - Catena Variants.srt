1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,970
potential competition so and today so
last year presented actually container

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,510
crane road and today I want to pretend
variant of this framework so we worked

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:20,020
on it and we find some new instantiation
is for the underlying primitives and so

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,439
i know i 12 percent how far we got so
yeah I wanted to some motivation at the

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,360
beginning when I want to introduce to
cut in a framework itself again because

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,469
somebody if you might not know it so far

7
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,550
then I want two percent some extensions

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:45,309
basic graph structures which we used to
instantiate the Coral Cup to know and I

9
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,818
want to talk about his functions which
we consider but this is just a preview

10
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:52,829
comparison and then at the end of most
important part of some 12 percent

11
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,569
recommendations which we which we
constructed based on our requirements so

12
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:08,180
first of all que pasa competitions are
you doing for two years from president

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,640
32 1503 years where the end the radar
gun was chosen by three different

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,490
variants the first one is going to I
purchased two independent memory access

15
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:26,080
patterns which means that is not a word
against kiss timing attacks like some

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,160
but then it was the second row and are
going to deal which has a passport

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:40,860
dependent access pattern which has been
highly resistant against ethics for

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,110
example refugee agency views so it's
quite nice tradeoff resistance and then

19
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,480
makes a high-powered very uncommon to di
and today on a per cent seminarians to

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,990
the right now but which were built using
our framework cut him short of 24 GHz

21
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,050
special recognition so long side of the
united to marquai and yes corrupt so

22
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,669
doing the presentation competition there
are a lot of new ideas like we had to

23
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,160
consider a memory hardens because we
want to be resistance against FPGAs and

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,150
sheep use because we always want to
exploit the slow memory so we do not

25
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,850
want to have the movie you when you have
someone crossword Justin 11 casual so

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,310
you want to go far beyond their story
want to say okay we want to have like

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,720
four megabyte 64 megabyte or even one
gigabyte of memory to exploit these kind

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,620
of attacks then reintroduce actually
garbage collector attacks which only

29
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,500
work so similar for the Kashmir text of
the address where success to the PC is

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:56,110
actually hashed and garbage collector
take just looks for the memory which is

31
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,920
44 the stage roots of the password
hashing scheme which are in the memory

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,869
after the password is already has shown
then we try to find a way to try to find

33
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,180
a way to compute password hashes to test
candidates then there was a discussion

34
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,330
about property plant and independent
memory accesses so based on the kind of

35
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,200
success

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,750
your scheme might be 10 ever to cash
rhyming a text for example then of

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,660
course the FPGAs and keep your system
also topic then cover tourists and his

38
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,230
colleagues came up with a text
compression function which highly

39
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,569
depends on the hush hush you deploy as a
basic primitive annual precipitation

40
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:46,510
scheme never need delegation creature
Deposit Scheme my car which was based on

41
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,540
as a matter cryptography and two major
properties called climbed a minute

42
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,269
update which lost to operate department
has any interaction of declined so you

43
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,580
do not have to type deposit itself which
is quite need if you have some in

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,030
inactive user comments like refund or

45
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,190
some years ago we found on that Facebook
has likes seven seventy percent of their

46
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:16,010
kansai an actor but you can still up
their deposits of interaction and was

47
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,880
also quite nice so we really feel they
can trust the main airport of computing

48
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,000
a possible change is shifted to declined
so like this year a Facebook like a

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,700
million tonnes per day or whatever then
you do not have to do the main memory in

50
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,840
time everybody can trust shifted to the
client and then looking at cutting our

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,489
first of all it's our scheme and was
published one year before the password

52
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,510
hashing competition and it has some
quite new ideas are brought up some new

53
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,890
ideas like it also feels really flexible
LED money possible schemes or there was

54
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,349
before there was yesterday before but
they were not quite flexible and we have

55
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:10,540
a lot of flexibility you can reply to
replace all instances certain kinds of

56
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,820
other primitives to protect against that
it was then it was the first pass

57
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,440
protection scheme which implicitly is a
private client independent updates and

58
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,900
sober relief and it's based on the text
be found on the other hand as cooked it

59
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,380
also provided cash timing assistance
today I mean to send one example where

60
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,870
we also have some kind of 10 penalty
against cash timing but into fame over

61
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,220
sequential memory hardness which
delivers timely trade over its two outs

62
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,090
adversities using these kind of tomatoes
flexibility of containers basically

63
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,570
given by yes it's looks like a lot of
paramount as possible once you

64
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:03,050
understand and then it becomes quite
easy to to build you own your own under

65
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,360
hence the first of all we have two kinds
of functions

66
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,430
ages are critical function always it's
cannot or should not be reduced from

67
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,090
because then we cannot guarantee the
security

68
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:20,948
we want to have any every 200 H crime
which can be deployed on certain

69
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,880
physicians to provide a better
performance than we have some certain

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,370
kind of memory heart functions f and
assist us 52 from craft and some switch

71
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,610
over to us briefly later then we have to
time in memory cost per middle school

72
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,090
actually london is the depth of the
graph itself and cheapest you can say

73
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,450
that the bricks and 22 the Chester
maximum number of memory you you will

74
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:56,260
use if you are legally use them and then
I represented a two extensions to our

75
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:03,039
core functions function sexually call
flap because they don't like a fly and

76
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:10,520
then flipped Worcester yeah not a good
choice for named the average 20 percent

77
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,729
to extensions one is government which
deploys a memo

78
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:20,280
independent memory access but for white
some needs resistance against ethics and

79
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,429
I provide the second X introduced the
second extension which is called fear

80
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,880
and the like in what seemed like an
escrow so we have some sequential memory

81
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,500
heartless but just very good against
trade offer low memory takes ok so based

82
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,680
on based on the PC and based on the
discussions we have some certain

83
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,610
security requirements we are looking
ahead to the first only common security

84
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,500
requirements like you're curious
resistance which is always required for

85
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,210
password hashing obviously then we
wanted some resistance against long

86
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,510
memory attacks because we're looking at
memory demanding proselytizing schemes

87
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,820
and if you haven't allowed to use low
memory and still get the consultation

88
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,270
and I think what time it's doesn't
really make sense so we want to have

89
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,340
some resistance against these attacks
and of course I feature a naturally

90
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:24,140
comes with a high memory usage and
especially if you look at ethics then we

91
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:33,569
want to have some when was in there
because obviously ok then we have some

92
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,870
application is pending security goals
which means do I considered a series

93
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,890
which are able to actually look at the
memory I use for possible testing so we

94
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,180
have two kinds of attacks of forces
collectors takes a second discuss timing

95
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:54,780
attacks and we have four key derivation
the biggest goal is like random over

96
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,280
security which is not required for
password has involved but as we try for

97
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,980
key division because you want to do is
you always want to hear when them as in

98
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,070
your case because else a lot of proofs
just fall apart

99
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:19,310
ok now we come to expire looks like
those so first of all it's just so we

100
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,800
ask this so we have to streak here so
we've created so to tweak the passport

101
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,800
and salt industry contains everything
you can think of its like use idea so I

102
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,920
D I P whatever as you want so it's like
making deposit has as unique as possible

103
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,199
and it's impossible to get different
specials on different systems even if

104
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,630
they use the same salt salt is always
required for like rain whatever it takes

105
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,140
a lot of it's a common input for
politicians schemes and of course the

106
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,030
prospect then we put these important to
the into critical functions of this

107
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,910
always these two are reserved to be a
cryptographic hash functions and not

108
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:13,230
every choose from because else we cannot
guarantee security and then after you

109
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,420
300 second-order possible way you can
you should in memory because I'll see

110
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,900
what you get with our two week garbage
collector takes baby just say ok you can

111
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,670
look at the memory doing the computation
of the possible terrorist and you can be

112
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:37,949
defined as possible though you find out
where you much as possible so this

113
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,930
actually is also one security part
against me comic collector text because

114
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,959
not only possible service to be
overwritten but if you if you gain and

115
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,870
value which is significantly faster by
from the password and you can catch it

116
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,670
from memory you can of course test
possible candidates candidates must file

117
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,689
story and do not have to do all those
things here this is why we we deploy the

118
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:10,180
small flap function here it's just our
lights the memory in a fast way this is

119
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,620
why does a smaller than yours too big
the big one this is actually the slough

120
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,720
quarter loop so it can be called
multiple times what and recommendations

121
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,510
we have to say she actually called
garlic

122
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:33,120
detail minds remember we used and we
always said 221 their user to soups

123
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,430
actually called once in our
recommendations and then you call it the

124
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:47,069
basic order the cross and I i receiving
about in a moment so it is actually

125
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,200
based it's a memory hard so we require
to be memory heart which means to

126
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,250
provide some resistance against time and
we trade off attacks and this is always

127
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,910
our instances are as given by across
base structure but I will explain it and

128
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:11,160
ya at the anniversary last car to a
cryptographic hash function before the

129
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,880
August generated and just hash function
actually leads to premature assistance

130
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,950
for our scheme because if you cannot
convert from x to hear

131
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,160
you can of course also next to the
password so it actually just call here

132
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:35,680
to mind subpoenaed security and this if
you look at the structure you can you

133
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,660
can just draw lines here and everything
about this line stand by the client for

134
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,660
example and then there's actually sent
to the server and of the trusts history

135
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:55,280
has taught us well you and then we have
like a so relief ok and yeah i dnt can

136
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,790
have some time creation parts

137
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:04,150
k2 like 32 bits of 16 busy then of
course it's not that secure anymore so

138
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:10,329
usually the output here's karen was $201
bit so if you just want to store 128 bit

139
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,340
or something like this then it's secure
and it works but too much truncation has

140
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:23,590
not got obviously then to cost cutting
as I said so this is a big part here

141
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:29,380
just looks like a properly structured
process the the output of the from a

142
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,980
call to flip then you have some
sequentially out here

143
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:43,070
ok I saw you one thing this function
actually took a vacation age and put

144
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:50,230
your statements of arbitrary size
because we used if the lines here this

145
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:57,750
small arrows she calls and the thoughts
of the world or what he sees

146
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,900
state radio so we have to to achieve
their dreams here and these are produced

147
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,100
by calling the function and if you want
to have a high performance then except

148
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,260
for this one and almost across one of
you can be computed with the reach you

149
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,480
swear an oath to his function so just
for a performance issues the actually

150
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,050
really quiet this morning the corps to
have a possible independent memory

151
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,630
access patterns because then your text
I'm not an issue for us it's always

152
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,450
quiet biased and we will see rich and
census for this one

153
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:55,430
ok 200 sorry for this this was still the
initial very end and they did it to use

154
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,699
to to formally computer and then some
sort of tradeoffs attacks introduced by

155
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,480
copper torched last year a possible
anymore you quite a lot of a lot more

156
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,170
memory and then at the end the last
where you have this graph of the last

157
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:20,490
computed value is actually in the output
of just called to flap ok no to the

158
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,930
extensions the first one is court going
on and we always used in front of the

159
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:33,020
function f so this is just another be
recalled layout

160
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:39,350
operation on the interstate 287 to
interstate but not before one because

161
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,260
this would be too too bad regarding to
performance issues so we say ok you on

162
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,800
2222 3G divided by four randomly chosen
statements which are updated and

163
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,020
randomly chosen in this case means the
input government is a public input so

164
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:04,140
these chosen said what's depend can for
example depend on the salt we do not

165
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,170
want to have dependencies on a password
here because we call it in front of us

166
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,020
and if you have some cash timing
problems here if you launch in cash time

167
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,189
in Texas which used it

168
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,750
effort for computing a prospectus of
looking at the memory accesses and this

169
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,800
part so you can reduce the effort for
testing a possible candidate

170
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,260
significantly sorry the first place on
the beginning we always want to have

171
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,089
some possible independent

172
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:37,199
but random memory whatsoever in this
case we use assault and of course

173
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,079
there's always supports or provide some
assistance against Essex because as I

174
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:53,680
said when the memory accesses always
destroy as a result to you can you can

175
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,878
actually come to this

176
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,920
not on an essay thing copy everything to
me as a computer Swan and then copy

177
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:06,418
embedcode something else but we think
it's not really reasonable the second

178
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:13,470
extension yes she and we use secret
opponent memory accesses between in this

179
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,720
case it's basically depend on a possible
but not on a possible terms of course

180
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,620
but on the last stage roles of this
class structure of course all these

181
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:31,529
values depend on the possible because of
the intro to tell us game and then in

182
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:38,120
the Army Commendation be used the veto
override all here so in a sequential

183
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,830
manner and the input roots here are
given randomly section of the state of

184
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,830
two to the Chi values here and to
compute this there's one you choose the

185
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:56,039
increases which is just one and then
some new toys and where you from here

186
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,830
and the choice of career depends the
first choice depends on the least

187
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:09,039
significant bits of this state ruled and
so on so this one is computed by its

188
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,179
recess and the Beast and the second in
the state of mind but any significant

189
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:21,230
she bit off this one so this accident
behaves like a script that we have a

190
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,630
state of 2222 values and all the inputs
for their for the next three or four the

191
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:32,279
computation is chosen randomly based on
already computed state roads and this

192
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:38,740
protects this provides sequential memory
hardness which means which means if you

193
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:45,600
if you have a parallel sending you
cannot reduce the memory for a simple

194
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,080
computations

195
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,350
computations ok think I have to speed up
a bit so I would just play our cost

196
00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:00,100
structure there's not much to do to
explain it anyway so does this relate to

197
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:08,189
2220 he was in this case choose three
and the first idea for our first

198
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,280
instance of Catan Abbas using bitter
personal attention that Justin bids

199
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:21,649
given us a bit representation and then
they are trust and then the opals given

200
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:26,129
sanctuary for ways to improve the
computer next one second ron is a shift

201
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,140
at Retrevo soviet Charles Bouchard stats
on where you see and in this case you

202
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,130
can see it's like Christ symmetric and
this was exploited by an attack by

203
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,840
terrorists so busy search for another
variant another craft so this looks like

204
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,959
not a semantic anymore but it's based on
your doorstep imitation and that's why I

205
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,549
didn't deliver any good results against
it XP considered so we came up we search

206
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:58,450
for new to us and they became

207
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:04,770
actually been heaviest thing came up on
the PRC mailing your bills and this

208
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,010
protects quite well against a few
competitions that takes which was

209
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:15,440
introduced by Kohler toilet sold so they
are two variants with Qi X to annex 3

210
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,220
and then the of course cross structure
changes and also one basic incense

211
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,669
looks quite complicated this is actually

212
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:34,059
two times to frustrate transformation in
the middle and this provides long-term

213
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:41,070
memory hardness which was proven by
proven by Luongo and laying on time but

214
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,379
I get the details so in comparison to be
just found out that against it takes we

215
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:53,119
considered the great we will strive for
us the best choice so it has to the

216
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,959
highest penalty which means additional
effort and it also has to has to do if

217
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,869
it has less memory available

218
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:10,809
ok so we have some relief possibly and
some tunable prosperity and which does

219
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:16,059
not protect very well against attacks
then quite possibly hundreds protects

220
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,970
good and the best protection is given by
the most complicated very envious of

221
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:29,929
course also quite slow ok this is a
comparison of the chance to use but I

222
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:35,909
will give us a processed process

223
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:46,009
dcfs compression function actually gone
with the Luda the new a function used

224
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:51,989
inside but yeah I was moved to the new
recommendations I hope I have some two

225
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:54,919
minutes maybe

226
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:06,109
actually our contribution so here ok you
can see things move so we put everything

227
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,529
together we had our base to build
instances and then you put four

228
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:16,230
different instances they have some so
used both extensions but of course

229
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,739
preparation so we have some new
protection against Essex GPUs are still

230
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:27,379
fast application and hardening based on
the compression function and across the

231
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:32,498
country because of this the second one
of the fastest phone before throughput

232
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:39,659
about 1 gigabyte per second for garbage
collector text if we have only one day

233
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,730
off this one if you have two layers then
it protects quite well for us too fast

234
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:52,600
very very and then we have some trade a
persistent berry and reduces the complex

235
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,019
class and sequential memory hard
extension so disgusting maximum

236
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:03,580
resistance against tradeoffs but while
still providing reasonable performance

237
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:10,418
and then we have two hybrid approach but
which Christ will protect against Essex

238
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:18,389
using the layer and so also have scored
resistance against to head off a text by

239
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:26,428
still gaining are providing some
reasonable performance and yeah that's

240
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:30,290
just a comparison of 24

241
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:39,889
and now i cant sorry for the high speed
so what he actually shot quite flexible

242
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,770
framework so we can replace a lot of the
underlying primitives on the underlying

243
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:48,870
schemes by providing certain security
goals we had a look at different in

244
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,500
sensational crime and the graph-based
institutions and we introduce two

245
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,300
extensions to our scheme for certain
security reasons then at the end result

246
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,440
for new incentives for password hashing
and we can use the same instance as part

247
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:12,010
of a bigger graphs and replacing the
function by the then we can use these

248
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:19,470
instances for key derivation and looking
at different instances where we can say

249
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,290
we want to have a lot of London memory
hard drive and stands by the constant

250
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:32,899
apso the most complex profit I've shown
close to death if it also closed and so

251
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,620
on

252
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:45,850
ok but we want to have a constant lies
at least for the that ok so the last

253
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,399
site is extremely questions

254
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,420
yeah okay thank you
