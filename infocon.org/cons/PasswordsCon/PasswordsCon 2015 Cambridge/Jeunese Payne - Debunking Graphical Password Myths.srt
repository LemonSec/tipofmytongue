1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:13,900
all this young lady which makes for an
interesting night with all the crazy

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:22,600
people in the audience I would say and
she has done so we talked before I'm

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:33,350
sure she will do next about pastors and
psychology so just as I was just leave

4
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:47,319
us a fortune as I'm janiece and on the
psychologist I've this'll be my 3rd time

5
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:51,350
Hartford Conn I've given presentations
before the psychology behind the problem

6
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,869
with passwords and about the
decision-making processes in password

7
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:00,219
practices this year I'll be giving you
the short tutorial where I hope to

8
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,850
separate some of the truth mahaz truths
about the psychology behind graphical

9
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,180
passwords which have been hailed as a
usable alternative to text-based

10
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,930
passwords even though they haven't been
widely adopted and I should point out

11
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,390
that this is my new research
contribution or anything but I do hope

12
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,049
that you'll find it interesting and in
my bed to take something away from it

13
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,610
also I'm really nervous and I have a
cold

14
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,230
be happening in social science is that
people here and easy to describe

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,740
interesting psychological phenomenon and
then they run away with it

16
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,250
way off into the distance and an example
that most of you probably heard of is

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,560
the magical number seven for those of
you who haven't heard of the magical

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,110
number seven in 1956 George Miller who
was a psychologist for the argument and

19
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,390
evidence to support it that the human
mind could retain about seven chunks of

20
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:06,460
information in their immediate memory
plus or minus two items problem yet

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,419
since then it keeps getting used over
and over again and also at the field

22
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,899
people love this magic number seven and
the problem with that is that the magic

23
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,660
number seven only really applies to the
cognitive processes involved in the

24
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,570
retention of very simple stimuli and not
complex information processing MIS

25
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,359
otherwise involved in everyday tasks
which means it's often incorrectly and

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,110
over applied to many things and to the
same degree this to a similar degree the

27
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,570
same can be said for the psychology used
to prop up rattle passports and so with

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,890
this in mind this is the structure of
the tutorial I'll give a brief

29
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,230
background I won't go too much into the
story of what about possible if we don't

30
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,149
know about it I'll talk about memory
claims I used to prop up graphical

31
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,220
passwords which will involve me talking
about the pictures appear to affect me

32
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,000
talk about recall talking about
recognition then I'll talk about some of

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,970
the potential problems with graphical
passwords and then I will round up and

34
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:14,360
answer any questions if I have time and
should you have any ok so

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,290
knowledge-based authentication is the
most common form of authentication

36
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,590
typically taking the form of a
text-based passwords and like I said

37
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,130
we're all very familiar with the story
of what about the usability and security

38
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,609
issues the faster it and there are three
main categories of solution for dealing

39
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,390
with this you could implement a
biometric BAE Systems you can implement

40
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,959
a token based system right there

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,250
implement a token basis of such as pique
which I believe frankly we talked about

42
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,400
and or you could just improve the
current knowledge based system and

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,459
graphical passwords along the proposed
way of improving the knowledge base

44
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,490
system

45
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:31,220
images an array of other images you have
low key metrics which involves clicking

46
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,710
on target points within a single image
and then you have drawn metrics which

47
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,250
involves re-creating a drawing or shape
like you do an Android unlocked for

48
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:51,890
example ok so there are two main claims
she's to prop up the capacitance but I'm

49
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,080
not saying incorrect at this point or
anything they might not necessarily

50
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,919
independent of each other first we have
to claim the pictures are remembered

51
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,260
better for longer the words because of
the picture 6 superiority effect and

52
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,010
then we have the claim that recognition
outperforms recall which is only really

53
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,450
relevant for econometrics rather than
the other two types of graphical

54
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:22,930
passwords and a look at these in more
detail so important differences in

55
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,250
general we have memory superiority for
pictures that's better than four words

56
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:36,150
so in a study by now and for example if
you give people a long list of words and

57
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,380
a long list of pictures they will
remember about 10% of words after three

58
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,100
days and 65% of pictures and so the
question is why might this be the case

59
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,780
well first people congrats man remember
concrete concepts better than abstract

60
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,539
one so he gives someone a picture of an
object that that's a concrete concept

61
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,660
and picture concrete pictures tend to be
better than cochran remember better than

62
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,500
concrete words which are better than
abstract words and pictures and more

63
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,460
visually distinctive the morons and
producer Richard sensory perceptual

64
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,640
representation and memory making
individual pictures stand out more

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,789
pictures give the preceding more direct
access to meaning pictures more

66
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,430
elaborately a person or elaborately and
that any picture you see tends to be

67
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,070
matched with project typical images that
you already have in your mind at the

68
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,620
same category of thing and finally
pictures are proposed to access to

69
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,650
memory stores one verbal and one visual
which increases the probability that

70
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,719
you'll retrieve a member of the picture

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,590
arguably the same can be said for words
in that you can imagine a picture to go

72
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,929
with the word but that's less likely to
occur spontaneously as it does with

73
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,960
pictures so if I see a picture of all
I'm also more likely to think of the

74
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,469
word ball if I see the work or less
likely to think of the picture that goes

75
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,690
along with it

76
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,960
memory in which the participant is asked
to recall a list of pictures of words a

77
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,159
typical recall test my asked me to write
a little words like on the flight here

78
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,170
and then to record them later without
any cute and this might be okay with

79
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,990
seven or so we're at like here but the
longer the list the harder it and this

80
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,600
is because in a free recall trashed you
typically have very few cheers hope you

81
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,140
remember all the items appearing the
list which is especially hard for items

82
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,270
in the middle of the list and in this
case that would be words appearing next

83
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,669
to the word father which was in the
middle here while we're at the beginning

84
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,510
and the end will typically be remembered
but due to vote documented primacy

85
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,840
effects and the type of person who
prospered that relies on voluntary

86
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,070
recall would be a draw metric scheme and
as we know from research by Marcus and

87
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:01,330
martin who was under pair last year we
need the people control certain say the

88
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,590
people like to draw certain shapes and
star in a certain locations so it's

89
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,270
quite predictable if you had mochi is
the material in the middle would be easy

90
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,570
to remember and in a lab a setting this
typically involves paring works together

91
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,830
so that when you show the participant
one word that the more likely to

92
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,289
remember the word that was paired with
it and in the typographical past that

93
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,740
relies more on cued recall would be a
low key metric or I clicked went type

94
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,350
password and again we know in the
password community that people will

95
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:40,190
often choose points to each other
through if you've got a picture that

96
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,470
they say most people in this room one of
their points that they click will be the

97
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:49,360
face of my picture and finally have
recognition which is the most likely to

98
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,760
result in memory retrieval because there
is a full copy of the word that you're

99
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,530
trying to remember in the queue and this
is what color metric graphical passwords

100
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:03,630
like possibly

101
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,480
the argument i when it comes to
graphical passwords especially

102
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,370
complimentary passwords is two-fold
first recognition is better than recall

103
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,370
although not always because it relies on
implicit and an automatic memory

104
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,430
processes so for example it would be
easier for you to recognize a picture of

105
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,359
your own country that would be to draw
it from your memory and all its detail

106
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:35,410
and 2nd St for recognizing images it's
very to them a competitive for

107
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,800
recognizing words and in fact standing
who try to find our upper limits of

108
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,670
recognition memory found that we could
recognize ten thousand pictures the

109
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,650
following day and he measures despite
getting people to tell what was old and

110
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,670
what was new from a left however we
might not want to place too much

111
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:05,040
emphasis on this such a shepherd in 1967
also found that word recognition was

112
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,219
very sure it was ninety percent accurate
if you force participants to make a

113
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,130
choice

114
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,770
himself also found that despite great
accuracy with pictures

115
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,640
the retrieval time for words with better
and also many of these experiments only

116
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,170
involve distinguishing old pictures from
new pictures which does not necessarily

117
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,930
mean that actually remembers the picture
and all the details of the picture so

118
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:42,459
that's a check I'll describe an analogy
for you to get across the point and it

119
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,420
killed the bitch on the bus scenario I
don't know I don't know what inspired

120
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,990
this analogy but here is nonetheless a
man gets on the bus BC someone he

121
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,330
recognizes he knows instantly that he
liked and I simply cannot for the life

122
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,430
of him know where he's worried about him
what his meanness later on in the

123
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,819
supermarket goes to pick up a piece of
me and then he stopped to think away

124
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,748
I do I know this guy from the picture
from my local for my from my local

125
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:17,529
butcher and so what happened here was on
the bus he got this feeling that he knew

126
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:23,179
the guy which is recognition but later
on have to go for a conscious retrieval

127
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:33,478
process where he actually recollected
we're here to see this guy before so now

128
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:38,309
the butcher for graphical password you
may be familiar with some pictures you

129
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:42,350
may go I know that picture from
somewhere you don't necessarily know all

130
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,289
the details like what would your
pictures go in or for what services do

131
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:52,189
you suppose to be using what had
pictures so one talking about here is

132
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:57,019
knowing the difference between knowing
and actually remembering something like

133
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:04,299
I said knowing is fasting feeling and in
comparison recollecting is in comparison

134
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:09,459
in terms of like how fast your brain
works as a slow conscious process and so

135
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:12,429
can we really say that pictures are
actually being remembered when we talk

136
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:17,939
about graphical passwords and this is
important because the user of a

137
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,998
graphical password has to do more than
simply recognize images they have to

138
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,899
remember things like the order of the
mouse clicks on how the shape was drawn

139
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,659
and you may well end up with some of the
same problems associated with the

140
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:34,059
proliferation of traditional passwords
in terms of usability and security for

141
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,179
example if you let users choose or
impossible because she's quite

142
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,999
predictable graphical passwords just as
they do pick predictable text face part

143
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,519
with these suspects tend to be lower in
entropy just like text-based passwords

144
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,149
also they can be shoulder Sarah and they
can be stored and shared by just taking

145
00:12:51,149 --> 00:13:00,629
a picture of it with your smartphone and
additionally the fight claimed to take

146
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,619
longer to log in with us so people don't
really like using them and find these

147
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,959
graphical passwords became widely
adopted it you just have to remember

148
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,599
different graphical password for each
site which could lead to errors and

149
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,209
interference justice takes place
possibly two areas

150
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:20,248
interference and five just like verbal
memory memory representations are

151
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:24,949
subject to interference by item category
similar although interestingly according

152
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:29,998
to at least the perceptual
distinctiveness of an image such as

153
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:36,769
color and shape had little impact on
interference this means that what we

154
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:42,040
already know affects all aspects
memories and only with a detailed

155
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,469
conceptual knowledge that she's you know
you know this is a red sports car and

156
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,319
that's a red racing car with this
detailed knowledge are we able to

157
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:55,610
maintain detailed representations in our
minds that we can then later act

158
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:02,170
accurately retreat so given all this
information if you take nothing out in

159
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,160
this presentation I want it to be but
there are always cabinet where her

160
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,540
psychological theory of phenomenon is
used to justify anything so even visual

161
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,980
memory has limits which means even
graphical passwords have limits even

162
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:27,880
though the psychology underpinning our
customers might be correct

163
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:50,840
claims made by people to uphold
recognition of information can be stored

164
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,010
individual long-term memory but in terms
of the number of items and the level of

165
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:01,950
detail per item number fifty bus and
these idiots but if graphical passwords

166
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,130
were to be widely distributed there's
still room for interference in era

167
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:11,800
between images in a single thing and
between and between services you might

168
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,569
get confused about the order that they
go in or to order that the Cliq go in I

169
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,130
would also caution how much emphasis you
play you place on recognition being

170
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,990
better than recall and finally should
keep in mind that visual memory capacity

171
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,070
is intrinsically tied to what we know
about what we're seeing and without this

172
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,850
knowledge people maintain and you're
just like ripped a representation of

173
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:42,930
what they're seeing which is separated
from the perceptual detail the take home

174
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,979
message for me is that whenever you hear
about some psychological theory of fun

175
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,490
being used to justify the scientist a
design decision don't just take it at

176
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,580
face value their psychology might be
correct for the conclusions drawn might

177
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:09,190
be incorrect or invalid and there is
usually a bigger picture to consider

178
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:58,070
she also saw security people don't know
about that I think we should know about

179
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,329
and also atop the craft's genes in the
conference in Las Vegas in the beginning

180
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,169
of August

181
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:17,300
don't talk that drop your possible and
howie some truly great stuff I can show

182
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:26,530
stop the almost more than 19,000 bottoms
in the world for different types of

183
00:17:26,530 --> 00:18:34,320
graphical password skis and fortunately

184
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:49,939
but actually probably educated guess I'd
actually disagree with you and probably

185
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,340
say that there's more interviews with
words because and where do you have to

186
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,519
be able to interpret first before you
get to the meeting where is the pictures

187
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,919
to directly get directly to the meaning
immediately and also referred to you can

188
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,649
get you might letters mixed up with you
know where you can have very

189
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:10,250
semantically you know sleep and snooze
get people to remember those two of them

190
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,320
will likely get them to remember sleep
and ensure that the world's news the

191
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,700
more likely to say that this other words
get picture you know someone sleeping

192
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,259
this way or that way then I would guess
but I don't have anything to support

193
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,830
that that you would find it easier to
tell the difference between the two

194
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,850
images them between Sunnis and sleep

195
00:19:31,850 --> 00:20:37,840
yeah I got a reference 30 at the Bonner

196
00:20:37,840 --> 00:21:10,300
I don't have any person

197
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:32,060
limitations to the study afterwards I'm
sure they haven't had enough time to

198
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,929
read all the papers out there so I
thought two pages of reference to slide

199
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,490
the references the title I read for this
presentation and I obviously have my

200
00:21:39,490 --> 00:22:19,940
undergrad psychology knowledge of memory
is low but I think I think program on

201
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,260
the team because we have to become an
expert in psychology and promises that

202
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,740
many of the things that they use for
example when I worked for NCR all the

203
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,380
technology adoption stuff talks about
specifically one type of talks about the

204
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,650
theory of reasoned action or they'll
talk about you know low-level processing

205
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,360
and deep level processing but they won't
talk about the most famous model and not

206
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,280
my more recent model or a model that's
more appropriate and employment for

207
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,320
psychologists and they'll be able to
tell you there are other models but what

208
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,980
happens if they can see it in one paper
and then you think it's entirely

209
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,250
different to just you know in reference
that one and then it just happens over

210
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,520
and over and over again so it doesn't
just happen in with phosphorus happens

211
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,580
with human computer interaction and
usability as well say

212
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,269
I would just say interact learn talk
more to each other and stop believing

213
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:16,090
that what you know if it's the only
thing can possibly be correct

214
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:55,918
yeah sorry if you picking people thought
of aging yeah probably

215
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:24,059
and they found I want it depends on what
kind of food do you live on which part

216
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:30,440
of the country in the world not only
that but in some countries they have a

217
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,480
much wider selection of food so they
caught up in some countries remembering

218
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,549
what is your favorite food security
question would be a long hard to recall

219
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:51,769
the last one of them say thank you to
janiece I will have three minutes
