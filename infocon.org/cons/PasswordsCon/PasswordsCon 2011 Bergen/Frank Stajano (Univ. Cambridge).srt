with armed that we just thing

176
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,410
this is speed from time

177
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,368
lemme the past words mild

178
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,839
long

179
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,220
yes yes are the password will be longer

180
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,509
died believing me air more of them to
die

181
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,930
and you you pay less for Zack would be
that time the whole thing

182
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,489
at that you have to do more there more
characters

183
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,290
anything but easy that number of
character that you enter is not

184
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,750
exactly representative %uh ever you
happy birthday

185

so many other bullshit

188
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,329
days to ship 10 days in jail the
characters and saw

189
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,719
yeah may are a the bus safeguard

190
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,149
you and other hand that maybe twenty he
serves

191
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,230
to get as a tack even we have I'm

192
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,259
I the Pre smartphone

193
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,000
had more just guessing even a while

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,290
as the cytosol heat

195
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,899
yeah I the number laureate less

196
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:14,439
page and flip back various burn people
so

197
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,160
you had number you press that is not
reflected

198
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,290
accurately just the length of the
bouncer as straight

199
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,889
for so

200
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,759
her back then is that

201
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,370
is a about three times faster

202
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,120
tonight the whole credenza with a
password then

203
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,410
his good greater this is

204
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,740
look his security obviously them where

205
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,950
yeah fashion

206
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,000
his I humility distribution

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,250
for security parlors pro is Broadway

208
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,260
experimentally where

209
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,630
that day these the despair

210
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,000
City artsy well passer the user said

211

and then okay we there yes brightly

212
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,580
about their security on the average
price

213
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,960
so Baker

214
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,150

words they have and a

234
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:49,569
based on well probability you want you

00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,739
when it comes to so

243
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:24,529
if your password

244
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,929
a slappy har you

245
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:31,089
are probably to enter the password hit
only

246
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,149
that then weekend here

247
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,799
him your password for you the first

248
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,089

and the there and I don't create new
prevention day

259
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,189
says maybe as their faster combination
may

260

J be aggregate probably you know how to
use the words together

266
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:50,118
base on and there and round statistical

yeah and if you're

292
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,139
to rate the area that might be that is
like that they're market said

293
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:26,899
you know it in the paper this
fascinating sore about how

294

essentially a he's this

295
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,459
yeah in their hours

296
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,379
are yes they sped

297
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:41,299
much of these a.m. extra security margin

298
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,980
budget to make this is a more youthful
part number:

299
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,500
allowing heat to medium and still
working days

300
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,109
is more secure and not always maybe

301
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,850
a different which are you do words over
the past year

302
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,969
the purses uses there the number be

303
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,990
many bother to be done or just slightly
well she's

304
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,710
line third lead St
