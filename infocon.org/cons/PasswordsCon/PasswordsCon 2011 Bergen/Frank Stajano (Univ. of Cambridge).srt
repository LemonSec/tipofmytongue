that passers

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,539
makes sense when you had one pastor

34
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,220
the that mine

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,630
and he didn't have that many what
happens now

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,549
there people have plenty of things do

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,830
boxer and the bathrooms have had more
complicated

38
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,290
then regular and retrieval I'm

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,109
memory of normandy not know the people
who obsess about it

40
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,209
memorizing 100 digital by comes means

41
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,910
I'm sure that many here yea we shouldn't
use that the senate

42
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,709
so the security the their regular humans

43
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,190
that pastor be yes it will and possibly
the brute force

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,829
means they just be like a cattle fish

45
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,550
be long got this will actors

46
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,959
and they cannot be something that he

47
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,160
guess by looking Facebook page and
knowing but your pets are

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,780
thought and you have many house and
everybody has many

must actually

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,900
memorize them you're not allowed right
now hair

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,200

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,970
after that insult to injury you must
change the password every few months old

58
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,080
things first using be for

59

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,400
system administrators at every time

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400

dreams once you you are yes but values

91
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,400

I we are spending like the law up

94
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,010
line I'm the drama is that for people
who

95
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,530
a.m. let's say

96
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,270
in both people on the bus breakdown
someone working there

97
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,669
make him now have to distinguish between
users

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,090
so I have to do something at to

99
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,520
Security Council and what I'm going to
do said the bus obvious thing to do

100
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,640
because every other their webcam

the user has passerby are behind bars I
don't have to explain anything

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,650
is an obvious thing it doesn't cost
anything issue

103
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,710
passer and for me the cheapest

104
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,870
years day no and economy that because
everybody else is also the

105

just and so even though

127
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,020
let developers consider use

128
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,930
often issues hate and a half these

129
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,290
so

130
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,990
passwords are that has been said many
times faster as I know that actually

131

should and at work kinda grew slightly

133
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,940
just they should be that on usability
grounds they should also be there

134
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,310
on security grounds at because

135
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,900
personal the federal government that we
had

136
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,979
the previous line I possible percent

137
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,220
Daisy me that some of them with his
hands even if you have the user who is

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,820

142
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,340
referring to main bus very long common
simple crap then

143
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,030
European week bus we bout yes reforms

144
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,189
I you can have at

145
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,010
users dropping a requirement I'll having

there's militias inside once I all these
things

151
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,540
because all the other sites responses
use

152
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,719
to become at

153
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,860
and that because the pastor a.m.

154
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,050
systems to copy clergy workmen's

155

sometimes forget classes there

156
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,420
system providers have to cater for that
we ways

157
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,170
regarding they had these questions that
in which I'm went

158
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,990
too much name

159
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,250
that sometimes it's meant he'd be
getting that way and my

160
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,910
tracking processor at just at the bird

remember about Mb

165
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,340
and then written down somewhere at is

166
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,670
like the be written them we did
impossible yet

167
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,010
some their asses

168
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,580
there besides

169
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,070
acts that are enabled by thank you use
returns

170
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,290
are possible together the other things
that bother

171
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,140
said to one fishing

172
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,779
where another site what's up okay

173
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:33,060
from looks like this site very

174
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,939
restraint that faster than that that the
pastor

175
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,610
beyond I'm and get

176
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,839
just one automated for social
engineering

177
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,279
their wells others that tricks

178
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,700
that the bad guys and personally day

179
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,740
and suspected car there

180
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,980
and then there's young

181
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,560
which is senior different category where

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,939
an exerciser your computer watches

183
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,029
he's for your back possibly

184
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,399
it's a very complicated mine is a very
own password no

185
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,200
crack you doctor just people into he's
not

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,680
so there's a a

187
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,939
and Facebook from Bill Gates

188
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,640
yeah from 2004 there's no

189
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,130
that overdone like that power

190
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,730
the same bus system statement

191
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,209
down they just don't challenge for

192
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,770
they buses the Jan

193
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,260
and %um you so add

194
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,630
passer should you are

195
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,189
here so

196
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,160
the question here is lot if we start
again from scratch

197
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,279
are you realize we come staffing for

198
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,240
there you could be both

199
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,900
network tester never weekly good restart

200
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,910
from scratch what would we do what is
the best possible thing that we could do

201
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,240
is that poss passes are good remain is
that we know

202
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,920
for compared to be these factors well if
we didn't have his hands

203
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,089
you come up with anything that so

204
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,180
this is this paper mache with this fall

205
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,290
and there have been many interesting
proposals for

206
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,449
fixing possible getting rid of passes at

207
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,540
or doing something better oscars
especially on

208
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,800
let now on the wet make sense

209
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,910
today's on where for the whole doesn't
let is

210
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,069
responsible for the proliferation passes
at me

211
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,610
had with us day before

212
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,920
there weren't that many things that
ordinary users

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,640
your head a.m.

214
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,819
and second because we do where

215
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,600
you have unit for interface everything
the same everything looks

216
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,959
night sounded can be rented by route 6
Freddie

217
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,349
easy that this is across

218
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,890
men's higher for the user for the number

219
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,329
non-computer use at e3

220
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,500
not enough to say well on things that
bothers for a wet

221
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,760
and every other part had faster than
simple the cheaper

222
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,839
their a for user

223
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,190
pastor is a possible impostor the B's
and C's easing is

224
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,300
where there is a web browser know the
imposter or fun

225
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,420
virgin boss with their I'm well so at

226
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,180
we have two any the right now and

227
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,839
at that brought it up get real

228
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,680
all not just let so

229
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,120
before I start from

230
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,060
this at that point what R&D meeting the
requirements that

231
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,810
any solution should well personal it air

232
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,140
I am fed up cream the fact that of

233
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,529
yet pretty has to be

234
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:13,820
users should not have to memorize
passers R&D

235
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,779
his boss some people have made things
back not possible it's made out

236
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,949
letters password me to squeeze our
bosses made a

237
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,209

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,420
should that me for security

241
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,990
that with a replacement we come up with
should be at these

242
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,030
I think you're but here and as secure

243
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,600
as the password will be we could make it
work at even that

244
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,560
from South doctors aren't because worms

245
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,140

249
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,970
we went from just having do having don't

250
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,290
these United should be scaled even

251
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,469
without occasions he he did

252
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,390
fact that we are going to eat their
acting computer systems that

253
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,630
been not necessary do like computers not

254
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,700
good like this they may look like
everyday object to be

255
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,720
this could be

256
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,819
and stuff the nineteen the top nonstop

257
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:37,389
so at or scary their unit

258
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,839
should were now I their

259
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,850
here paper at as really find work to be

262
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,339
that beams app is the thing that

263
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:03,189
with asking for a password because the
system under the proposed

264
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,219
rely on though the pasa

265
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,269
let you know done though that

266
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,689

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,678
so personal

281
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,140
user no longer have him

282
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,180
at now is entered a

283
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,930
it worse for all attention not just the
lead and

284
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,930
and 1 problems that users shoes we
bosnians

285
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,810
me that beat the system which isn't look

286
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,250
with the disease the people choose

287
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,780
the classroom he doesn't even use that
reaches prevention user

288
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,410
feasible me week 1 another problem

289
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,760
about users relieve them you

290
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,010
same one different sites and BP

291
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,890
happen I fishing

292
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,080
is also possible because recognition

293
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,490
between at Newbury

294
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,320
people this is something that in some
cases

295
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,350
you awesome have essentially

296
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,820
you have to make sure that anything

297
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,679
is not use other problem

298
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,800
which is everyday division also

299
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,899
that really be is that we

300
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,970
my fingers fix sleepy that

301
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,050
the user does not have to select the
greater

302
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,129
pretensions imagine that you had a don't

303
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,780
that new all your passwords and their

304
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,570
like you had a possible these things

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,810
am be said

306
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,820

the signs points and which French

316
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,720
for that

317
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,160
that under never

318
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,410
eavesdropping up the passer is
impossible

319
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,260
uses them his some past

320
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,580
systems do depends on batteries

321
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,699
me the verifier a I said this did not
follow

322
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,360
he talking which is kinda Notre

323
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,490
on she eavesdropping is awesome awesome

324
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,760
and related to but a separate and

325
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,220

here now to this list

359
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,990
passerby might expect I at

360
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,630
okay yes you did as possible and

361
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,970
no no change very these are things that
II

362
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,060
the side not girls for the people

363
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,360
because I hope to be free role

364
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,719
that these happy strains

365
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,250
northern to design problem solution now
this

366
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,660
mean that worse weed out the

367
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,000
this place us so at nato

368
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,530
me be I'll wasted that

369
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,040
compromise on some up to then

370
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,070
so that me provides

371
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,939
in that direction we provide but that's
not where I want though

372
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,660
but we have to start somewhere great
vicious sir

373
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,730
closed because arrested

374
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,570
that at his so easy that land

375
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,450
for that all first won't be a problem do
that was the previous night

376
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,700
second how people were

377
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,250
and because be good though and

378
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,800
open should be something him said

379
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,000
how people injured won't work getting

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,330
yeah and conversely how do you ensure
that

381
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,100
you have read our years you

382
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,389
some session features the

383
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,660

00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:04,130
time and just that

391
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,420
examinations up extreme

have them and display at that

410
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,340
doesn't have to be as a measure for be

411
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,629
number shapes sake had these

412
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,850
feature the that people

413
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,918

freemen we're in Jersey in the
investrend time like

420
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,130
somehow we got worse

421
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,380
the place

422
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,769
where that very fire asks

423
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,639
or user ID and password is comedy

424
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:04,500
by a be I'll this video

425
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,799
work yes line by the also

426
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,168
ego range University

427
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,519
me we happened in the past

428
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,830
now might be where mines multi-channel

429
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,168
Security Pro you propose where you
several channels

430
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,450
Daisy send different messages over the
brutal because

431
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,200
different channels have different
problems so

432
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,950
probably all this video chat personal

433
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,570
the bold illegal action only

434
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,879
the there is no the ginger

435
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,409
from be at a

436
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:50,700
it has very is security feature which is
that

437
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,750
the user knows for sure work

438
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,760
the other hand ball the this is not the
case re with great

439
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,158
ok something the other end with any its
identity but I cannot be sure that is

440
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,529
not

441
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:09,710
some other reason radio that is same
pretending to be this computer

442
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,789
exactly a this the handle

443
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:17,419
pc2 missus yeah PC looking right
actually something

444
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:21,720
here where at yeah is BCD

445
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,020
display go and I'm where that that it
can't be because

446
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,918
that important feature of the

447
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,279
I really didn't the past well

448

your action it's a at you're saying here

449
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,480
at it just carry a whole for okay

450
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,919
he you can maybe hang the finger where
at

451
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,450
the hope be so over rage

452
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,570
doesn't and they raised

453
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,600

557
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:17,620
to do with the right so that's why I'm

558
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,730
and then I be show has yet to prove he
or she

559
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,820
hard secretly search and respond use

560

I was there is the only get 10 per

564
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,760
fenner and then I found that night

565
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,899
an obvious be the that

566
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,159
yes I did yeah

567
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,710
the longer ownership are the people's
accounts

568
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,879
that and

569
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,040
from then on at

570
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,360
they have both through to each other the
yeah

571
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,730
be the that he and then

572
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:13,110
that are the country's occasion where
through the rain yes

573
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,820
both the me bill

574
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,210
and a.m. whose

575
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,510
you problem I'm

576
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,680
them compare you

577
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,180
and miss you as you yes

578
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,549
so at you Iranian with 1 I'm happy that
you

579
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,340
are their you're asking depressed this
wasn't clear

580
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,790
the I want to reassure you that is this
design

581
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,110
is specifically to ensure that you are

582
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,550
as anonymous as you can possibly be it
is because you have

583
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,140
different body heat for every account so
in this

584
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,339
slot I store the RDP

585
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,450
up the ass and next the will be my own

586
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,250
party and probably keep their for that
particular sorry chica

587
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,550
I have my own pair and back even be the
same

588
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,630
that wasn't very far for example
jeanette

589
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,540
okay I have region and cons each one of
them have its own different dimension

590
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,250
and

591
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,900
gmail user not be able to link those
together

592
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,609
unless it is something and application
that okay so

593
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:26,390
and precisely for preserving

594
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,950
my a.m. my privacy I am giving

595
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,000
and anger party at this stage

596
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,390
when I'm not sure that'll run very far
at

597
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,490
is dead of money long-term funny

598
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,640
way longer yeah longer he for that
particular account

599
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,350
so even that they would have only been
able to know that I was

600
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,560
that guy that had 84 for that not linked
to the ones

601
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,370
from other s okay so what happens

602
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,460
with apparent that so I don't have

603
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,840
I want to create a new account really
sad maybe I

604
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,620
act on it or maybe a half hour and it
was a great how I start from saint

605
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,680
stay already at same editions

606
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,839
cream and I just pressed Bieber on my
people

607
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,359
black divisions for yeah

608
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,509
no that I may get 1% are you sure you
want me you

609
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,290
you really have one for the spit you're
not me runs along is the app doesn't for

610
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,109
me to send back

611
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:30,520
he should be that the then remarrying

612

I have to within here if I didn't have
multiple accounts

614
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,640
there one of my original claims

615
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,200
is not going to be a hundred percent
will feel whereas at

616
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,700
that the user longer has to select the
credentials

617
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,700
because they're p depending on the act

618
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,430
well that is true in the sense that at

619
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,319
the Beagle with know that I'm directly
the sacrament this happen to have

654
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:03,740
and just use people these his now

655
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,430
this is prime for something where
creating an account has no

656
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,980
previous stay as a opening up in you

657
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,070
email account we pain-free mantra if you

658
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,119
are opening you're creating an account

659
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,550
which has to be linked with some
real-world result

660
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,109
there's another step for authenticating

661
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:28,819
this by so you for example

662
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,000
I am setting up an online banking

663
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,730
bad know and make you cum

664
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,930
and I already have bank account with
that

665
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,089
back then I have somebody somewhere

666
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:45,150
and when I on Monday be here

667
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,170
then back I expected I'm link that

668
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,380
to the money that I have the phone
thinking that you this

669
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,430
I'm there so there has to be some
binding

670
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,970
be doing this thing tonight do you hear
the people which is completely

671
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,040
there coming out of nowhere

672
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,630
and is the have been previously with
that this money is done

673
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,339
the another China which is neither

674
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:12,339
the radio division is the back sending
me

675
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,440
for example by poster I'm you doing
director

676
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,520
Sony some other okay which

677
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,339
better shape are paper leather just to
interact be the cameraman

678
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,779
be and then and what would happen

679
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,579
is that the back end up the back said

680
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,930
letter you we especially one

681
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,328
only vindicator said where you're going
to tear up

682
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,050
and create your and you out with us

683
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,089
then you have to exhibit an
authenticator which is this

684
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:50,810
the ship them to you now it's a you will
used to be good to say okay here's the

685
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,119
letter from bank classic worries go

686
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,359
and speed-up when you see this

687
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:00,109
but he so there would be one good season
authenticator

688
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:04,170
one 10 nonce has to be sent to the bank
you got that letter

689
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,220
none 1 it says this is the phone he
which

690
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,980
you have to send this does anything but
yes 3 you believe that your people and

691
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,599
your discretion is a

692
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,970
here here comes your indicator that I
got from you both

693
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,020
and that is that okay I think that

694
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,030
to there that action back and

695
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,930
mine resort that position

696
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,359
use and at

697
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,078
30 at record units back n

698
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,410
that from them

699
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:42,919
interacted just like

700
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:43,920
for that

701
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,680

so I just don t backup and then to
restore

976
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,329
I can restore backup he

977
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:37,339
black people that i buy from the store
but i dont have none of the people so

978
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:37,680
that

979
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,660
is the way to I hear try to minimize the
number

980
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,299
I'll extra their for two constructions

981
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:51,040
that I I'll already had or not

982
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:51,980
so one

983
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:55,260
your he I'm not you a.m.

984
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,740
create

985
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,350
and backup new shares be creation up new

986
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,509
be deceiving you can do that when your
b-day

987
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,840
not going to be not be make other
because you and many

988
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,260
you many have not be very happy to have
you to do that

989
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,510
and him over here

990
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,670
you're happy just alright on time I

991
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,780
just be said take your question

992
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,290
and there the other thing that you need
to get it back up

993
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,250
if your people see things themselves so
there needs to be

994
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,770
so other at the city which I have the
day

995
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:38,230
beaches Saudi had is

996
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:41,310
this is so that you do lose

997
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:45,520
your because the leader the world you
another hearing is more fashionable

998
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,080
might be able to register that another
friend management so

999
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,350
add if I'm being honest about what I see
the problem with this team

1000
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:57,509
that all that and serious stuff to do
with it

1001
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:01,000
management out the BBC maybe there

1002
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,470
weakest on being usability there that
users me

1003
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:08,890
well is much easier than having that
NASCAR's been so much more complicated

1004
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:12,299
hey did you happen to be phase yes

1005
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,690
I'm you see you his own

1006
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:20,290
visit the you can visit you that as many
times as you want

1007
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,840
they could have sold he does is there
any way to

1008
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,250
disable no once a user and you wanna
make sure

1009
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:32,030
doesn't work the a that's a very good
point I guess that

1010
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:35,170
at least 30 that the networks servers
share

1011
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,690
help you you can have if you and I'm

1012
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,780
I I think that this is something that
anything

1013
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,250
harder about the and there could be
something

1014
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,660
where nation out maybe is here number in
the people

1015
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,940
and the stuff that these in think they
have backed up

1016
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,970
can be used to distinguish the various
instances

1017
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,859
from each other and you can set your
policy at the network service a

1018
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,300
I will now only use this particular 1
and the other one

1019
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,470
i cant that because I'm not there I get
back to the same

1020
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:12,020
yes their very best

1021
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,450
the look at both the KL

1022
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,700
were looking yet do

1023
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,939
see that with work together that is the
key

1024
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:25,859
or is it something else I'm me because
the problem with both

1025
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:30,350
breath by would be a very bad idea
because youu

1026
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,779
yesterday

1027
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,380
those little yes so he would have to be
something where there is a program that

1028
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,000
runs

1029
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,550
between their be considering and a
beeper that these

1030
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,980
resistant replay basis something where

1031
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:48,300
if you have overheard the conversation
you can you predict the next few months

1032
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,869
in penalties and can be

1033
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:53,450
reconstructed from there so it cannot
just be the single

1034
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:57,470
price tag americans love is that because
I think they just say the same thing

1035
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,339
over and over again

1036
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:02,369
then he had no record

1037
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:06,390
someone who listens in and replace
Luther KL

1038
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:10,779
with moral looked both people besides

1039
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:14,340
no I have no I mean conflict with Caleb
Folan

1040
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,959
seventh more

1041
01:03:17,959 --> 01:03:22,169
actual secret the know what I think what
I think I'll

1042
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:26,859
I had a the largest singular and do you
actually believe in addition you can see

1043
01:03:26,859 --> 01:03:28,058
all the food from

1044
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:31,749
what I mean visiting is that this at
will storage

1045
01:03:31,749 --> 01:03:35,609
inclusion up to be is I'm not by a key
this bit

1046
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:39,169
as these k after that so as soon as

1047
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:43,719
the time now said I don't have enough to
to do this and he's he's the

1048
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,609
and you cannot axis economy create
anything that seem to be

1049
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:50,899
any thoughts for did so at as in

1050
01:03:50,899 --> 01:03:55,078
any real bathroom storage encryption
system there is a partisan

1051
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:58,599
angry because I lack of bootstrap to
that part Manhattan

1052
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:01,809
you thousands that exhibit actually I
can access

1053
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:05,279
any the residence stuff because the
secret secret

1054
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:09,149
is not there anymore and I wanted to be
something where

1055
01:04:09,149 --> 01:04:12,299
is not gay that these open

1056
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:16,089
when you see there okay other than
shares

1057
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:19,249
that is something that weed out those
shares there's

1058
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:23,308
no way to the crib because the keys that
very should be something that

1059
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:26,839
is very well you had enough attention to
let your dreams

1060
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:29,989
is more like yeah pretentious

1061
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:34,239
to for the Christian making

1062
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,569
as a because

1063
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:41,889
the you have %uh the old-growth

1064
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:45,189
fielder the their up father

1065
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:48,209
the truth you and the

1066
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:53,828
turns down forces good and

1067
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:56,329
this right because it is basically a

1068
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:59,829
it he actually a

1069
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,840
group

1070
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,890
yeah a me is just

1071
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:08,100
here and it seems like it would be

1072
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,160
compared to other security let the
system

1073
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:17,250
looks like the here bed how to do that

1074
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:21,590
well as a because it it you

1075
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:25,410
the weren't they you does constructing
the

1076
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:29,430
the the discipline and it's just the
thirty

1077
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,690
minutes that

1078
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:36,730
her because the whole lotta you I with
them

1079
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:40,000
being whether it's not k event the
center

1080
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,010
no chance appealed no yeah

1081
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:47,230
procedures Benny this is me then you
have your answer is always a big ego he

1082
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,430
has started back to work

1083
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:52,549
me yeah 156 pinsky the time was %uh the
beloved

1084
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,790
you it's not other partner but at I mean

1085
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,810
the difficulties as I see

1086
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:03,529
how easy is it to get home are enough
because she

1087
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:09,840
and and I guess yeah

1088
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,870
there because you make themselves

1089
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:15,950
have to have enough whom to do

1090
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:19,049
me cryptographic here lame

1091
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:23,210
but they also have been have enough add

1092
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:27,150
tamper resistance that the you find one
then you can just look

1093
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:31,090
get its stuff and I i dun

1094
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:34,780
presume that the user is going to
rewrite new keys

1095
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,570
you the BBC's me contractor

1096
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:43,510
something that you in the ham para 24
here he we don't want the hassle is

1097
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:44,440
going to be so mad

1098
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,420
if you want to add another civilian make
are share her you have to recruit your

1099
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:53,580
don't wasn't a question

1100
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:57,440
you

1101
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,190
I

1102
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:05,009
for

1103
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:07,249
up with the bossman you this evening
track me

1104
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:10,479
supermarket so a even

1105
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:13,680
survey be seems always answers same
thing

1106
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,009
right it means that we don't want that
because otherwise

1107
01:07:17,009 --> 01:07:19,680
some over here record

1108
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,680
people so the problem we need

1109
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,700
is one challenges of PBMC

1110
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,990
the where people's on that basis

1111
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,069
the things that that civilians sale
should be

1112
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:35,570
different at in

1113
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,590
I am the only person you know we carry

1114
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,940
you can check super everybody he said it
bothered you

1115
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:45,470
be that you have continues Jeffrey other
various

1116
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:48,870
the Pacific around people that they
might not be added

1117
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:52,200
because name it and even every time

1118
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,299
to me you are party today pro that you
can

1119
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,320
very high seeing

1120
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,460
you your your as them

1121
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,780
there again home yes but I have to say I
haven't

1122
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,890
written that brutal that he has to be a
burglary at least the feature

1123
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:15,080
that he got beer lead and I imagine that
a really that we could do something

1124
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,549
where

1125
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:22,550
yasser yeah

1126
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,990
were real

1127
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:30,309
you

1128
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,920
you

1129
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,750
his more opens

1130
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,970
them security as well

1131
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:43,250
this this left multiple tokens

1132
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,600
K out to fear or with my I'm

1133
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,830
you're not gonna carrying case

1134
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,359
tho is you

1135
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,389
you know it the point is that

1136
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:00,000
the maturities you just have to have you
know hearings

1137
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,010
10 you're here you don't have to have
him here in America

1138
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:06,250
yeah you know in you know opens

1139
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:10,120
let you know

1140
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,969
which is a you know

1141
01:09:12,969 --> 01:09:15,410
store his

1142
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:20,040
its mobile called

1143
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,509
you'll at

1144
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:27,359
I am sure we are the same way this is
multiple tokens

1145
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,359
just don't have the for all the
buildings except one

1146
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,950
are used not last long the last night
like this or other financial

1147
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:39,729
the other don't store after that
shouldn't have any user interface

1148
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:43,468
it so the difference is that that you
read okay

1149
01:09:43,469 --> 01:09:47,120
is just there what's really happening or
something else that doesn't

1150
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,620
have to have is that exchange every day
and

1151
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,200
at the only one with a directory is the
one that has bothered

1152
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,489
play with the rest and I don't want to
have yuri

1153
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:02,429
we're user interface no your aunt

1154
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:06,780
measures really is very at at care only
fair

1155
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,480
basically made and it right

1156
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:15,160
land around me said to be good between
that they are not use for

1157
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:22,160

several my less than what you are

11 I'll literally if you stand in your
kitchen microwave

1178

you my instill curtains open for

1180
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,920
palm the actual radiation things like
cell phones are

1181
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,170
I'm me overblown are I'm

1182
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:02,719
even fun for example you with the
powerful

1183
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,990
home you should worry about that you
shouldn't really worry

1184
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,740
are from of arm

1185
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,960
or for that matter even just yeah
general

1186
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,020
yeah a concrete

1187
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:20,180
some people get home pretty

1188
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,120
too much higher degree

1189
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,000
I'll and the other thing with the the

1190
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,410
the gentleman who's talking about Open
button you're referring to

1191
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,470
you think it went to your site RSS very
them

1192
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:38,270
will the problem with that though is
that

1193
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:42,500
with that you can use only the the
cooking itself your real name

1194
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,000
envision visit someone had token for you

1195
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,780
you thought that username and password
him what have you hit

1196
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:56,769
people yet hearings

someone is keeping you and you manage to
break your people bring

1202
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,240

and so that the people get law makeup

1204
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,630
lucky if your network says loved

1205
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,590
this

1206
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:32,290
after if you where didn't worry so much

okay next day you can see not him

1208
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,560
his all trade-offs me the Paradise to

1209
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,600
is not something that I say very Sears
that

1210
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,810
that did I'm going to these

1211
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:48,920
from trying to make things easier for
people

1212
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,100
constand the password as we now

1213
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,750
but I also wanted line and said that

1214
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:00,100
this is not going to be major drink here

1215
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,370
onto protect things wrong people month
%um

1216
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:07,510
document workers on the for because
passers

1217
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:11,590
thing is that many be yes as I

1218
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,630
people my thing

1219
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:17,940
yeah economic growth repeal

1220
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:22,919
the thinking about to go for you want to
get the house I

1221
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,060
yep it everything and other I mean

1222
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,700
I'm in some poses the old one too much
secure

1223
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,920
have to prove it I mean it is something
that the wrong person loves

1224
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,150
yo you can go steal from the back
because we're

1225
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:40,610
well but maybe you will to make that
decision to sell

1226
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,630
love that actually I don't think the
should

1227
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:48,920
I mean it's a in yelling but it was a
very good to air

1228
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:54,860
with no service a big distinction you're
an intellectual discussion not not so

1229
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,980
much drafted

1230
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:59,200
the lecture extension here which i think
is right is

1231
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,519
he's there away recovery all our is
there no

1232
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,520
if you make a system where at some point
on

1233
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,210
narrator I made so that I don't really
know this country

1234
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:13,010
well you want to torture her you want to
be my daughter I'm very sad

1235
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:16,150
good me even if you do that if nothing
else I can do

1236
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:19,239
and iPod that's it if there is still the
case that

1237
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:23,570
year with me here I can do nothing to
help you

1238
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:27,610
but home I have a backup which if you
let me 38 good retrieve them

1239
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:31,210
of course you're still under threat this
stuff so long

1240
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,250
as year that bill and go back to your
home

1241
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,500
real very yeah further

1242
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:41,040
did I guess the predicate ever will be

1243
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,590
you let me go back home and he has to be
a meanie Americans on

1244
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:48,450
I did I get back home I can have my
support them

1245
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:52,080
machine guns against that

1246
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,010
intellectually the only difference is
between whether anyone can recover

1247
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,210
or no and nobody can recover them me

1248
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:03,360
again no rational incentive to torture
you for your

1249
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,489
beer once but me seed yes

1250
01:16:08,489 --> 01:16:11,650

1251
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,549
you no fine

1252
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,999
to

1253
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:19,139
said

1254
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,570
I'm and you so

1255
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:25,900

01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:29,589
be my people and I don't know and am
still around

1257
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,910
within range p that name you

1258
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:36,809
handed have to keep running into lappam

1259
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:40,090
do you know

1260
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:43,860
range thing nothing that we have to
worry about for the sky

1261
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,900
at radio his relay

1262
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,509
be very you know you number

1263
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:54,390
they were really great axes where you
have

1264
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:57,940
a regular for example something

1265
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:01,580
little and as I go in

1266
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,890
I don't have to there specifically

1267
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:10,740
reader just because year Israel

1268
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:14,660
senses me and opens the store so does
ruler is

1269
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:18,480
busy handling it very far little that
time

1270
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,589
sitting next to me here but have
something that looks like it or

1271
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:26,200
and from the next to my chair and that

1272
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,410
they said with that except for

1273
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:33,420
something and a senior they related
challenge response

1274
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,480
to some companies who is that every time
you lose like my toe connects the real

1275
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,589
then that Lauren challenges defector

1276
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:46,080
which is sent by so to the guy sitting
next to me

1277
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,160
you get here and this challenges read a
to my pocket

1278
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,900
I didn't know that I mean jack but it
answer a different response

1279
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:58,179
this is sent back correct responses and
that their these problems and offer that

1280
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:01,520
its every day that the problem in this
case and

1281
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,490
and the solutions to the attacks

1282
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:08,620
single pp them elaborate

1283
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:11,730
provable do time so that

1284
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:15,309
yeah because feel like is fine you
cannot be

1285
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,420
any further away that you have taken not
more than that

1286
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,570
and so we this kinda mechanisms

1287
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:25,599
for which my Marcus develop a specific

1288
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,140
are pretty brutal him it is possible

1289
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:32,810
to lead

1290
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:37,270
they relate back to something very
closely in which case you

1291
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:42,120
whole you might spot yes

1292
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,340
you say anything about the

1293
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,170
you save lives a you did say that

1294
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:52,840
most will be updated they

1295
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,840
inside it but

1296
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,580
if you break say real your southern
items

1297
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:03,240
than you yet so a

1298
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,370
it youngsters I'll yet home

1299
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:09,500
witnesses are you I

1300
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,410
this or yeah so here

1301
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:18,050
yeah like that there's going to be some
mess

1302
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:21,440
to do with that backing up I'll that

1303
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,320
people also up to creation

1304
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,900
addition the management backing up
shares themselves

1305
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:33,629
and I and be rate this is going to be a
week for is

1306
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:37,300
weaknesses this is going to be the where

1307
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,990
be guess control Ford

1308
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:44,370
management visions injured

1309
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:49,220
you you get decided

1310
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:54,600
hearing passions the 100-meter said

1311
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,970
necessary busy

1312
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:01,690
from busy you and my hands on

1313
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:06,400
who is the love this provisional
newspaper

1314
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,620
so we could go away and

1315
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,240
this is a very specific

1316
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,400
designed for the password is more like
in the FBI

1317
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,750
that is very them in the the

1318
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:25,630
also why there are so many this my phone
that didn't make the passwords because

1319
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:26,750
that's all part of the day

1320
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:32,090
guys deserve it the the I was wondering
if if you're thinking

1321
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:37,090
just taking the love the caller ID is
the this is Vishal sizable

1322
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:40,140
and Rio was in this case the

1323
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:43,300
essentially network or high bound with

1324
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,280
channel that is indirect as a sort of

1325
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,380
framework or concert because and

1326
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,740
probably going to be made in China with
the back door

1327
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:58,130
so here anyway the

1328
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:02,350
them beautiful the system

1329
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:05,440
or cynicism the US today with the

1330
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,929
mobile and the where you're going to die
I'm going with this as a

1331
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:13,950
like this was a defining the Michael
with you

1332
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:17,410
try to you were

1333
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:21,269
to to actually find his password as a
system

1334
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:24,850
were at global

1335
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:28,730
who I am trying to replace sponsors

1336
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:33,129
and especially the car %uh faster
problems that are the most underrated

1337
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:36,140
and for that reason I have said as my 0

1338
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,110
Prince that I one not to rely on users
remember

1339
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:44,769
I said where can I for that and I
started beating some who is there

1340
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,880
at least for intellectual honesty

1341
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,020
have to provide system is complete so
whenever it is OK

1342
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,780
I don't see well and that even someone
has resided for that said

1343
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:59,440
that's the start from and design their

1344
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,129
all the bases are covered but it still
pisses

1345
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:07,160
fairly modular v8 with it easy started a
fundraising to hear the people

1346
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,620
and that's all you can do is be good
it's okay which is what

1347
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:14,170
I mean you could say i SAT and ours was

1348
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:17,510
security building does that you know you
have a security lets you

1349
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:21,000
am I think using but you know song

1350
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,380
or maybe it's been a great being there
and is already addressed

1351
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:28,110
by yeah you know at so

1352
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:32,599
you could cut this people were in at
least two parts one that says this is

1353
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,650
how the work is how it's a high desert
like things

1354
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,889
the doesn't pass for them and this is
how you security

1355
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:42,170
wanted to secure something as be my
guest monkeys have been on that

1356
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:46,020
in nineteen just yeah

1357
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:49,100
that is a kinda already two separate
discuss

1358
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,330
how to may a.m. the

1359
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:57,200
E we had all these things

1360
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,710
we could we could certainly split at
split up

1361
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:04,620
Center Parcs any the month jan Brewer is
worth nearly seven years

1362
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:09,000
before didn't wasn't related to that
either this is one way of saying

1363
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,230
is there if we had no stranger to me
there

1364
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:15,540
a complete solution we could run a which
would conceded that

1365
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,230
and I can see this bet except for the
management

1366
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:24,750
problem up to the share so far

1367
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,280

your people Gaines Adams St a

1443
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:15,220
does you

1444
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:18,940
get add and anything tonight

1445
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:22,469
very first time solution and the only

1446
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:26,610
problem I see again practical
pretreatment

1447
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:30,400
star therapy learn from these per
represents my

1448
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,030
referring to this article Arkansas then

1449
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:37,820
I will not happen the correct people
with me than

1450
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:41,570
so that and flexible maybe

1451
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:45,920
and be happy

1452
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,040
another interesting thing that I

1453
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,360
thinking perhaps the most run

1454
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,200
intellectually stimulating aspects of
these in the context of

1455
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,420
not just getting real where possible but
all

1456
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:02,750
II had in to be very working

1457
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:05,810
an aspect of your panties on

1458
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:09,210
what are the other house that are not

1459
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:12,600
where would be things like you love you
to your

1460
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,340
back computer I really of

1461
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,620
network system or you like to your bias

1462
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,099
are you into I'm there

1463
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:27,430
think that last year car stereos a
company's dollar or anything for your

1464
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,910
burner all things that are not web
applications sorry

1465
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:34,180
ways to deal with that but the most
interesting one

1466
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:38,100
is one where there are possible that are
not used for authentication

1467
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:42,200
none of these not give up and that and

1468
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:46,440
well-defined rip Brit it's fundamentally
different

1469
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:51,570
from at login with username and password
because we

1470
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:54,960
user and password is at

1471
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,290
he's a guy &a gatekeeper that says prove
to me that youre authorizing your prime

1472
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:02,830
I open the gate eventually reader
interaction

1473
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:06,510
it's not that it's not that your
authorize an edgy is it I need those

1474
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:07,060
bits

1475
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:10,160
your the difference in the past
subsidies use

1476
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:14,610
for generating there he that actually
creates

1477
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:18,070
the fun you know the password there's no
gatekeepers that can say well you're

1478
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,230
right

1479
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:22,929
I just need is so

1480
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:26,270
I have tried feeling that into the mall
all

1481
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:29,270
the username/password anything Z you buy
monkeys

1482
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:32,920
the parent and them in butter with this

1483
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:36,040
that who will be the app maybe

1484
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,340
tradition for who would be that User ID

1485
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:44,660
no by name the rights are not me

1486
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:47,750
a if I victory

1487
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:51,970
the same five under the front passenger
answer all these

1488
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:55,890
is a I think a

1489
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,890
a different way using passengers should
be treaty

1490
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:02,410
for and it's not right to use

1491
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:05,940
the same SSL I've been here so many
things

1492
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,750
for generating he's too busy I think
should be that be differently

1493
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:13,960
and in this case the ego should have Sun

1494
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,080
randomly generated this spring that he
sends all

1495
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,440
in the same way that he would send a
possible if you were possible

1496
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,150
so the interaction has to be this

1497
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:28,700
however a friendly then there's a
problem with my problem

1498
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,230
work people to do it the the people

1499
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:35,679
will a.m. will not

1500
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,660
of you chew their happiness for this and
he will not

1501
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:43,280
a left here at the fish in this case

1502
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:48,280
because there is nothing there's nobody
here XP

1503
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,410
it will be possible or Sun malicious

1504
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:54,780
application to present me we define and
say

1505
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,530
Maggie that fine I have to surrender and
he and i cant

1506
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:01,889
recognized he returned it 52 I have no
insurance

1507
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:05,300
ample right his name it and so

1508
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,700
that strip would be stolen from now I I
saw

1509
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:12,550
are by the sea anybody sticky discussing
his FB

1510
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:15,760
that have a chat about his I believe

1511
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,060
had not I don't have proof that I
believe that there's nothing

1512
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,510
at you had could be done is I'll

1513
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:25,910
at I'm stealing day Vicky

1514
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:31,150
this case how and I going I recognize
that

1515
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:36,750
to be some and his ass

1516
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:37,250
so

1517
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:40,910
busy a a difficult reads like that

1518
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:44,980
borden and and I have missed you here

1519
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:48,190
various

1520
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:52,080
way I'll that replacing password

1521
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,240
that bastard here them

1522
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:59,010
million trees the rubble be you're the
ones that

1523
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:02,840
people I'm to do here being that

1524
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,190
acting where actually as you

1525
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:09,400
partner no changes servers

1526
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,530
I V Star other day paper

1527
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:17,610
more were in the first column

1528
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:23,299
what they say has been built it's unfair
to compare features

1529
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:28,560
something that you I don't you think I
actually said

1530
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,810
these things have been built these
babies are

1531
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:35,100
yeah just academic papers the

1532
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:38,930
these things at home you are publicly
available is on these are

1533
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:41,940
academic papers have been built but you

1534
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:45,580
a happy b are pubs and

1535
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,610
at Stanley widely deployed so

1536
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:52,190
having been actually that you that so

1537
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:55,839
no thank you every

1538
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,640
yes where these this

1539
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:03,470
line it's interesting you with my

1540
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:06,690
with it be used to back the one that

1541
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:09,879
it might be interesting here specially

1542
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,770
for being the are here is that seeing
this I know

1543
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:18,010
a single sign-on completely different
approach to getting greater possibility

1544
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:18,490
doctors

1545
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:22,420
man ok the then and

1546
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,800
guess you

1547
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,830
that that place of or just the way

1548
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:36,090
yeah

1549
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:39,580
so compromises to reach free nice

1550
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:43,580
well there this is my

1551
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:46,920
Pakistani ancestor brother here p.m.

1552
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,560
the supervisor I'll might be the
supervisor and

1553
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,690
bad he said optimization

1554
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:57,219
the process thinking something that
works and replace you

1555
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:01,260
something almost worse but less so in
that spirit

1556
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:04,600
we might consider optimizing these I
have to be

1557
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:09,290
very exactly that cost less old

1558
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:12,630
and one of these things could be to you
implement

1559
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:16,130
smart and almost worse refers to the
fact that operations is

1560
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:19,150
me day pretensions

1561
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:22,860
ways a another day

1562
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,929
would be okay if we just want

1563
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:28,970
to be compatible work exists today

1564
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:32,300
there's a chance that this is the end of
the senate doing all these

1565
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:36,200
party just have the Pico store your
passes

1566
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:40,780
and speed up the past into the abuse at
least beckons don't have to be changed

1567
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:44,620
he have changed but 17 I'm

1568
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:50,140
and a.m. as we said earlier we

1569
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:54,150
replace all the speakers these we do an
awesome possum

1570
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:59,420
European at the time up your your people
means

1571
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:03,600
for sleepies the yeppers rebar

1572
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,720
that I starting that this amazing buddy
just say

1573
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:12,470
so much head maybe the place so

1574
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:15,710
Mar affection here is rent land

1575
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:19,750
more were liberation from pastors and

1576
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:23,650
much fears that you Muslim

1577
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:26,769
yeah yeah

1578
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:29,950
first you have to build one that can
withstand and

1579
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:34,630
adversary you then at work he has a that
you can try out you have to be

1580
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,739
see they actually me were isn't any
better

1581
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:41,410
passes otherwise the point for and that
point

1582
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:44,440
do resign really

1583
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:48,860
and then for me the much you have to
give him something

1584
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:52,049
you you have been care

1585
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,900
friends facebook yes so

1586
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:00,739
you have to make things that I have even
though they're

1587
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:04,239
optimizations in their attorney dans let
you have

1588
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:07,370
football and then after that you can
build on this

1589
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:11,260
and when once you get it on

1590
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:15,080
where the login page looked like this
one here

1591
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,219
where there's at the user and password

1592
01:37:18,219 --> 01:37:21,320
and next three he is bi

1593
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,650
that you are you're happy

1594
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:27,950
everyone has a St yeah that easily

1595
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:31,870
him before tragedy

1596
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:35,370
the populations that change percent

1597
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:38,670
me that's a state where you're not
fighting

1598
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:41,690
for except because every

1599
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:45,599
provider every app just wonderful

1600
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,530
yeah and you get do more past

1601
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:53,090
so yeah

1602
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:56,890
my conclusions are that passers are

1603
01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:00,000
now be on there said Monday so many
other

1604
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,840
have that in the

1605
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,130
past few years and and so many of us
have tried

1606
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:10,300
provide some replacements now you may

1607
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:13,750
consider this very company up

1608
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:16,900
best possible you yeah

1609
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:20,639
but and even though it's going to be
difficult

1610
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,700
to thank you day actress be power

1611
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:26,840
we have a duty to think of something
better

1612
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,850
that passes for users and I believe that

1613
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:34,330
in this video me all these complains
about Peyton passes are

1614
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:37,800
with just the when you see how
unreasonable that

1615
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:42,489
aggregate constrains people so

1616
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:45,968
I think the first from other

1617
01:38:45,969 --> 01:38:49,090
doing here passers everywhere not just

1618
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:53,050
from where online sites and

1619
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:57,180
be the end this and the paper

1620
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:00,469
is drop somewhere

1621
01:39:00,469 --> 01:39:03,910
on night with this paper no I'm still

1622
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:06,969
religious brothers riding his bike

1623
01:39:06,969 --> 01:39:10,180
%um on the plane here I would certainly
be racking

1624
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:14,260
stuff after all he said today after
feature interactions

1625
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:17,690
we had being and

1626
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:21,410
if you're interested doing anymore with
this at

1627
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:25,330
opening at I have express be decided not
to bad

1628
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:28,890

everyone to believe that

1629
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:33,410
dreams yes good he didn't
