about doesn't break sent by post

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,060
typical uses replacing

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,240
as well

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,240
this my as all is as well

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,890
your and or that

48
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,849
all occasions

49
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,090
a Mario all this

50
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,270
different

51
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,610
so yes

52
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,180
with here

53
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,790
does I insert this in

54
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,640
very for and

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,750
just losses Dexter touched upon

56
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,700
seamless a USB keyboards seamless

57
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,298
sending see see so so this is why it
works all

58
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,780
I feel for spores is BBQ

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,400
us press again force

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,100
part stuffing say said

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,630
so this

62
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,120
to

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,780
C

64
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,479
and City these characters are encoded

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,370
mall case us K-mart's doesn't

66
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,550
return a be generates cankles

67
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,890
these are translated into

68
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,310
be computer and this was a problem for
us in the beginning this

69
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,710
because awesome cabled difference

70
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,870
define on characters Matt

71
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,450
frost yeah coaster said this is

72
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,210
not not the central time zone as hits
the back all

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,820
why the this 3 looks that way

74
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,930
us to me if I'm sixty characters

75
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,380
story and they're happy do or

76
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,000
Texas up said

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,360
yeah

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,750
same sources all all

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,060
X

80
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,030
essentially access so

81
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,520
you be able to be is

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,450
so it first of his actual I Syria to 16
characters

83
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,599
the ship that went well there's

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,060
step this is

85
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,770

486
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,649
but if you're feeling better locations

487
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,668
years sounds homers

488
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:05,780

yep don't use our system

492
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,740
because

493
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,270
the one-time passwords means missing
yeah

494
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,280
