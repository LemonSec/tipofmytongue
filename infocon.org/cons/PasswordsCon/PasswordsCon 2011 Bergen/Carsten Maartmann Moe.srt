all can use US Floyd's the and boys were
specifically mobile devices

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,759
and his days PC but it could be really
anything

33
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,189
and the loyalty open this

34
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,529
is a is up the

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,929
passwords pins a potential

36
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,700
when it is everything as hell through
software

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,750
on insecure or a

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,280
is basically with that big a physical
access

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
you machine this deal that for all

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,240
the all so

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,120
it will only show you a I'm gonna
there's very few

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,300
the switch or chrome party s there

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,210
they will use or for schools and they
will show you the

44
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,660
two different ways that I exploit
machine by if I am

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,170
yeses Eva above the

46
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,459
mention that over nurse don't over do
they're mostly

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,750
have nothing to lose more this I know
it's about it

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,170
but the really

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,220
then and the all physical security is
loading and unloading

50
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,700
his when this this okay

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,989
so the bathroom blissful up

52
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,220
a was a line you have like this

53
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,859
lays pressures injured where

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,110
the believe that they want that is the
little a

55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,090
and it's all good then other customers
or

56
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,380
or other users them

57
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,210
they really want to do you have a mobile
device iPhone iPod

58
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,760
you name it and it will soon how to
assess

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,480
all a were so the usual solution that is

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,340
you workers stroll he didn't measure

61
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,020
a and USS

62
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,360
June all the available information here

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,550
I'll a the and point or mobile device
I'm

64
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,880
from that perspective that makes the
endpoint readings

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,340
because you find a lawyer

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,350
machine within all media connection you
might be able to dislike button and the

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,210
interview

68
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,270
resources that you normally will not
that has been without

69
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,840
hebrew s layers so

70
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,330
mobile units they present real dangers
me of class

71
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,370
the they are small they are you

72
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,790
drop there's thing the to lose they have

73
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,140
over the years the below mention

74
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,700

or where you're building your mobile
device owners your is many people

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,600
put on those laws secured features on
top of the order

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,920
%uh software this mechanism

say ho menu

109
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,759
those are actually lost and how but
still

110
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,870
others well that combined with they
there

111
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,249
another is a traveling going on space

112
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:53,310
the room though the

113
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,610
special oranges the number sickened by
the droid

114
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,759
or whatever with what they've done it is
where you

115
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,029
to you just the pulpit and distributed
online

116
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,740
43 min so we

117
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,830
the netbook market to deal with this

118
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,479
going to go up and up with you

119
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,128
don't know and is or or like that
wouldn't you

120
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,669
the the assumption that you're

121
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,779
the but always in here you live in when
you using vision is a

122
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,000
yes the you doing

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,520
use you that happy knows everything
about

124
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,599
observation mission is in worse but is
as long as you keep the season greatly

125
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,550
using only other reason is strong and
that he

126
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,199
long you know you should be here

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,680
that is like this I'm home yours so

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,710
the best Park the best thing

129
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,919
and here will be able to do his Detroit
guess that he

130
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,099
give me his house for which Yuma

131
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:05,120
long enough %um should be okay usually

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,650
so when I over all these is from the

133
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,030
for on region from his vision service

134
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,229
on this subject a.m. his they see no

135
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,008
the made by more and more users that are
included

136
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,009
or albright or just occasions or

137
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,229
true containers that are all on Bravo's
about

138
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,870
and they want to know how Charles is

139
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,179
she locate the vision he somewhere on
the hard drive in in rio

140
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:39,179
the machine has been used you because
given

141
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,309
your passwords they only have the chance
all

142
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,739
well think your loss

143
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,750
chance shaking you

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,140
dream brute force and

145
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,279
the number you greta is that is smaller
than before user

146
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,430
germs a yes for so

147
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,510
you know the a you wouldn't

148
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,870
be that bases are you that occurs is a
is not

149
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,050
this is either inaccurate this is the
most sufficiently

150
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,310
a you go through world work no

151
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,329
people aside seldes for this summer's I
wouldn't really recommend is

152
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,899
probably lot more effective up a

153
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,100
I'm so you're signs out to get the
password

154
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,290
or that he as much were by

155
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,920
reinforcing

156
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,740
Yahoo anymore or the so

157
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,280
the the basis for much of his own yes

158
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,069
hello was a this will never realize

159
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,050
so what I want to do that is will for
the data is there

160
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,260
in memory when the machine is powered
all

161
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,360
and how them birth this for

162
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,180
get better and the

163
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,370
Italian their Prince this home and

164
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,259
a

165
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,480
the and

166
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,949
initially I E

167
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,439
well his for adults

168
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,610
occasion he and their daisy marie so

169
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,740
for a password and then respected worth

170
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,300
the is really a dozen see a

171
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,680
how much data is in memory while

172
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,880
machine is all and also certain poses

173
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,590
line yes for example

174
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,720
author

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,300
North the the password for the

176
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,349
you spinal the building

177
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,730
occurs within month or so

178
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,820
the pastors Ashley no white

179
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,030
from memory well machines on so that
easy

180
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,400
by then open a with a

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,400
going to because they locate passwords
using

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,360
just a symbols 3 answers from memory you

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,290
came to access also do a physical
assessment

184
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,410
and birth

185
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,000
way know the was just a bit lost here as
well

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,430
where they show fucking that shit

187
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,680
occurs when he's using however when I
spent a lot of it is

188
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,979
you you don't need stickers yet all
defined

189
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,140
you that is all a.m.

190
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,210
you only need to overlook it that is
because

191
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,270
whatever divisions a

192
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,500
meet certain devices those that use the

193
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,780
Serial Bus Pro Bowl a

194
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,890
June homes or reactors

195
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,100
I know this is just not there as well
but on the other it

196
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,990
we have their we access you bypass all
over the

197
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,150
so Realty and initially

198
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,040
re and eventually rights already to
memory

199
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,370
minutes to computers with with the
clever

200
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,880
know if the this only

201
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,270
the some devices or those who like to
use 0 both Pro Bowler

202
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,770
has his United nasa so

203
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,150
you know to do this load is me do that
you know other

204
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,880
play the bus I'm just because she and is
she with borrowed heavily

205
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,910
you meaning that no very bright Maria

206
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:40,990
very the yeah so

207
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,270
there's no room there is this love
affair is

208
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,220
just a with those St bosses could be
anything up the

209
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,440
century with the with Windows seven

210
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,640
verse Minister Thursday the thing is
that it was then

211
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,180
a a lot more memory's a little bit
longer juicer

212
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,370
so us use XD rosenberg with the

213
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,899
you name it every OS really that permits

214
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,550
year firewire the earliest soon as
possible

215
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,939
so a.m. this one is the

216
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,029
older sicker than with the for a bit
with people

217
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,189
preview a divisions in with you not do

218
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,959
a Ashley enter password be or a

219
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,609
you can use this all loaded Windows

220
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,089
longer remember you im just coronal
minimal are up

221
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,420
until the local growth non-lethal force
you understand hopefully

222
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,680
de beers murders basinger whole his

223
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,130
it has the lowly position he and the
membrane

224
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,899
or long distance or into Brazil princes

225
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,430
so he uses standard moles

226
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,760
a bit longer your injuries

227
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,899
removal this to you know any or for

228
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,149
this was all home

229
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,910
it doesn't comply or importantly

230
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,219
the those a especially or so I've been
able

231
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,899
only if I were in good while well as all

232
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,930
and middle school basically a soul
brothers

233
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,939
a and when I say I hate on iplug

234
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,339
the it will also be neither yes

235
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,700
so me and show this to you

236
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,120
the well you is basically

237
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,959
to search through membrane using called

238
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,239
we'll home which is made by

239
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,279
and you under ball middle school his

240
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,390
tylenol or 2000

241
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,670
the its he was bom publicly available

242
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,819
is the worst under those bill

243
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,120
people that there is news teenagers and

244
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,210
for looking in your global Britain
systems

245
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,740
basically how this works is that I'm
going into this machine

246
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,680
and people you know reactors when I get
I will start to use

247
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,739
mean the love machine memory light and I
rules search for a signature which is

248
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,570
basically the whole any in

249
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,270
XD that chance for pass for

250
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,569
the father signature

251
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,340
the program will whole pash that Paul

252
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,500
so it will always return true lol work
into

253
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,880
for the so actually brought back into
the memory on your machine

254
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,150
this light live benzoapyrene Google

255
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,970
the okay

256
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,260
me

257
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:55,260
year

258
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,069
holding up

259
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:08,070
all any use for him

260
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,920
this

261
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,640
got much less room know you're a right
away his

262
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,990
I'm with happened

263
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,130
day soda show you that this is

264
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,160
a look to see if I enter my password ago

265
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,640
getting and

266
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,680
this is the always been created

267
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,819
with a yes is the engine insisted

268
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,140
he so is this it should be others strong
said

269
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,290
so the that suction

270
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,660
disappears you keep your own just as
long as the software

271
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,839
a uninvolved persons running

272
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,200
the sovereign the sticky fingers and he
in every and when you have

273
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,300
oldest incursions as the that means that
it will be you know

274
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,480
real dingy as long as the machine is the

275
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,480
overall

276
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,439
alright so well I do I'm gonna be a bit
technical

277
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,070
the his I will also mean just the main
drivers

278
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:30,250

the real memory foam and Michael those
from

305
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,330
ball all to my life I worry as their

306
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,560

307
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,110
I'm honored by myself as well or

308
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,350
thing here is that 0 although if this is
your most fertile

309
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,230
lucky you well I think this machine who
they are

310
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,260
oh okay you use there in the front only
go there then reassess

311
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,879
so to show you

312
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,980
fine I'll love muscle into

313
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,470
this book okay

314
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,760
what's happening there my are his own
studies

315
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,180
the Windows XP Holy Land Rovers
Birmingham but a

316
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,420
and I can I'll run the we looked all too
this to us

317
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,890
because that's the manager's furloughs
local already those

318
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,140
I'll windows and miss love texture but

319
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,210
visited the only thing they need until
the

320
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,260
to is to use the

321
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,670
which port and an old

322
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,900
and well-planned attack people missus by
wire

323
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,990
or your local a factor which is this the
owner

324
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,000
real St a number we need to do as well

325
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
so what is the now is

326
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,360

00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,570
formally a harm

340
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,879
because you can remove all by mr.

341
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,850
and you can glue the the

342
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,949
passion for something you love base do
run a biz but

343

agree with you all

344
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,520
while only that go along with the user's

345
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,850
yeah leaden we know I I'm

346

347
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,300
going through lenient you inhale

348
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,139
mutual Jo no I had

349
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,830
so and the

350
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,480
chorus the with the MacBook Pros right
now there is a new

351
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,720
early thirties a.m. bulletholes and the
rivers

352
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,530
%uh this is also has been the same
feature agreement in your

353
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,100
I'm them United through the harbour

354
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,600
I million no a for role in all

355
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,870
his the former is the or the
sophistication

356
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,159
the specifically says you should

357
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,200
low the as early as probable burgers for
me United because this will give you

358
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,440
waited for a bit when transfer large
files

359
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,350
is you don't have to go through the
process so it's

360
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,600
really know the windows problem a is
more of a

361
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,250
harbors division problem another this is
all things

362
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,370
a I feel is important is that

363
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,600
is hard to do tho your when you bring a
little

364
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,629
hardware that is meant to just work like
button player okay

365
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,310
I'm gonna show you know that as well the
that will be

366
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,040
is less less than 1 useful lost your
butthole

367
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,170
people's mentions because well

368
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,490

are group

373
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,790
he did be

374
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,379
that

375
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:14,700
well

376
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,080
%uh you will not be able to although the

you are this year's all I know here to
download drivers on my paper sample

378
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,059
that will problem the the well as well
but as long as you have

379
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,710
let his remove the oath that'll with

380
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,169
for the struggling this I will not get
there

381
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:43,169
the is the easiest way that is over

382
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,889
that so from the attacker I'm

383
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,520
map this doesn't work for you because he
has movie is enough

384
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,670
just like his my you

385
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,480
I heard about that prisoners well think
that would not be here in just a minute

386
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,000
with a

387
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,530
X ewbal done little

388
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,399
loser it

389
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,230
doesn't and mid-level do believe

390
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,340
law like so

391
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,230
thank you issue yeah everybody

392
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,530
the this software way that

393
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,850
this yeah YS

394
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,290
determination Hindu I'll get it in the
end

395
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,720
his the you do is a balloon

396
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,110
in Pastor David Boaz you didn't know

397
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,699
is able love or lockdown

398
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,360
the lies possible

399
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,490
device is always media you like this
because to get help

400
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,670
yeah he will learn by management

401
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,850
is the you

402
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,689
you home the the bus the you'll

403
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,550
be able to build another OS unusually
high misleads the

404
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:16,580
and inpatient utilization the the
official visit New

405
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,389
the people who are they you know you
should the

406
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,070
I shouldn't be remove those drivers but
of course they did you won't be able to

407
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,620
you communicated on with their lives
vertical

408
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,709
will do with that reaction benefit from
it so if the there is

409
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,140
I don't think this is solution the is
with the whole

410
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:42,140
loss operational & Poor's 31 it wasn't
as

411
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,170
securities laws young players you

412
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,180
and you want to secure the US

413
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,350
me to Angeles yeah the

414
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,959
is there but this is the all the other
things that you can do to you

415
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,050
in make sure the what doesn't you know
your balance was all

416
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,220
I through yet the

417
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,650
courses harder and harder is a yeah the
strike you know when you're going

418
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,710
through these all

419
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,020
for time you the don't know exactly
where it is

420
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,830
so and even though you may be

421
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,810
might be the Justin like mold water and
there's a certain

422
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,240
drive-through worse always been
committed and always being all

423
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,550
the the the users will probably polls

424
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,620
they all were already do because they
don't turn off their

425
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,539
uses one day

426
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,789
is that that is that boy and this
machine was down minus on the others

427
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,989
the powered it all I'm it will be to

428
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:44,479
only within the same San Domingo

429
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,899
it wasn't hibernates though be order

430
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,789
because I'm using tribute and a other

431
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:55,149
you the Division Street there yet

432
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:59,379
the absolutely dismal securities is
important when he goes into us

433
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:06,179
this absolutely shit

434
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,900
yeah pasta that so

435
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,900
the was for that or pass along the word
about works as long as im

436
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,830
the biodiesel all this anger or older
drivers

437
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,429
polls this is unrivaled is

438
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,780
if this is believed to the

439
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,389
I was bout will be them through the
whole even if machine

440
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,870
all the annual classes the still it

441
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,350
YouTube in just like the Bible addition
the

442
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:42,350
is the well for me so these these these
guys they found a way to do that over

443
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,159
know that is vision loaders well though
and a little bit how they actually do it

444
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,030
because it's not that market

445
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,860
be the home and all you have to use like
new freezing a

446
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,800
loony nitrogen whatever to do this this
is not really hard

447
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,379
live worse think I'm gonna show you up
to you to all who that

448
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,510
this the the thing

449
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,770
why it worse is is because the

450
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,310
modern the his movie will use

451
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,379
round mobiles a you surgery to Luther

452
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,980
so it is however dole and it cut power

453
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,530
uses couple sentenced to you like 20
hours

454
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,660
so this Candice

455
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,530
periods in the senate cool the Bulldogs
addition me units then that the reason

456
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,580
while key state government is

457
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,000
they a for a long time the the

458
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,470
it do some who has with leavin I've been
there were able to

459
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,990
cool down enriches the with the win

460
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,910
freezing Korean in London

461
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,970
am transferred on a couple hours from

462
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:58,300
one place the in another machine don't
remember reanalyzing no

463
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,300
memory was still as it were when they

464
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,360
hola machine though postal

465
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,510
who created should be does that not is

466
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,750
both other is this

467
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,030
yes it is because %uh this approach is
over

468
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,060
ok on the citizens of other is in modem

469
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,810
modules is in bennett brown have to do
like the

470
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,010
a.m. refresh

471
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,020
power cycle of the around each

472
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,030
s nuthin in order he's that

473
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,639
so nor did he

474
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,950
the house is a low I'm

475
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,850
and also in North you cool around his
own guess that it would be

476
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,810
absorber quality the the ranges the

477
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,950
will need only a few hours of those is
that

478
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,980
City you state so

479
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,210
I bro

480
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,580
program the those analyzing the because
the

481
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,290
will you get them then read on from your
machine you need done was it

482
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,450
well I didn't know it I basically

483
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,050
the drill program that answer or

484
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,520

anybody the will sue me

584
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,859
that and I will be able to use search
for

585
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,010
think there's any and though isn't being
just a

586
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,780
powers of all so the schools are
minuscule

587
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,980
for schools well show you so far a.m.

588
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,190
you it

589
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:34,190
didn't these were

590
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,578
the in order to use search for the
vision you know they use the

591
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,650
me use my hole through both

592
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,819
I'm here it's Colin thurgood

593
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,869
and is this bill too low I use the

594
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:53,619
route through most is the agreement made
then minutes till

595
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,029
those the another job interview
searching

596
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:00,400
keys and just to be with your eye on
them

597
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,170
hell bitch the who looks fun though the
occasion he is

598
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,349
looking for and will plays looking for

599
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:10,630
it doesn't have to this is both simple

600
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,430
it will work in the search bit another

601
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,489
says his areas they will i'll settle at
approximately where in every

602
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:22,730
the thinking he's although his amber

603
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,859
is also there will be others I'm gonna
give it

604
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,489
a arranged lookin

605
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:34,769
and the I'm just going to give the pilot
just a little over

606
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:40,720
yet another cable a will base it doesn't
know it was funny

607
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,069
is that you uses Paes the

608
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,720
he is Spanish another written do loaded
he's just a

609
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,480
yes and the other is no evidence work
the way that they

610
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,460
the Marty into schedule over

611
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,859
many he studied using each round of the
other end

612
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,989
so it may be a SKS the he doesn't
deserve it

613
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:06,559
so all the round he is usual

614
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,200
are derived from the mall be well

615
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,509
okay so 10 you does does does your

616
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:17,930
mean that he user strung or something
else Berkshire

617
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,288
you old yes and you generate something
from

618
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:25,349
from the from this small

619
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,579
me oh you did right although it is in
memory

620
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,640
you think another reason one is

621
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,808
he and that is a bill reached by hope
that in the end

622
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:40,539
pretend the Bollinger cease-fires

623
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,269
are the parse he generate

624
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,519
usual I'm okay you

625
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,519
peace or lawyer %uh located right off
their

626
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,788
the that's you most piana didn't slash

627
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:59,069
this is world his own

628
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:03,230
those for other is managers a.m.

629
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,599
behind him something is forest the
Middle Earth still

630
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,099
a and he is wise property

631
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:14,369
from his suppose live around them is

632
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,460
although understand the random services
and back

633
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,940
do disease love heal the

634
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,910
decision his you love the look in the
memory

635
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,368
while machine was all so

636
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,749
although we do know I'll in or into

637
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:38,890
your I love this she would be to use

638
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,569
the this he and I probably have to do
some locations

639
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:47,410
june thru in order to be this like just
you're all

640
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:52,019
years in both and effortless the

641
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,538
she had been submitted Google as well
and there are rules for

642
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:00,130
creating young this and a bit longer as
well

643
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,759
solo completely

644
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:08,089
like control is the easy but I still
nothing fishing

645
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:12,890
yen you remember from the store was
there is indication he's very this

646
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,118
where the secure you don't think there's
a nice so

647
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,599
the only he basically means that the
individual is a genius

648
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,890
is wrong them is

649
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,038
prevent expansion even then men just

650
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,269
unit my

651
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:35,328
yes a love his usual the

652
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:38,559
to those but is holistic vision

653
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,559
it you cindy luce

654
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:45,259
all along so it doesn't have any time
was the

655
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:48,339
remember yes are used he

656
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:51,569
problem you think you should watch the

657
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:55,058
then these these these are useful

658
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,680
I'm that's why it's always a number yes
losses to

659
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,919
made things fast yeah want me

660
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,239
longsword then does the less yet but
this not only by the key

661
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:12,219
this don't lulu is following is your
message you can also search for

662
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:17,329
you know the Berkshire all love all the
dates for sure that it believe me

663
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:21,559
heels search for the using relevant to
the mushers ahora

664
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,920
that is II does Russell

665
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,799
ostensibly sometimes don't so using this

666
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,690
Louis funny low so base the

667
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,999
problem here is that the me though that
if property owners operators

668
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:42,250
through a whole sure that

669
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:47,660
RAM

670
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,480
later with him

671
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,950
program

672
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,348
I yes

673
00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:01,359
you year the problem is that it's lowe's
is

674
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,480
the his the

675
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,180
program to all the over the table is
really really small

676
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,339
is holding a sign so

677
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,930
made going to be us real estate will be
here if that's possible

678
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,759
in the embryo the the computer the

679
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,829
yes if you do specifically tell

680
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:26,540
the OS low he's you do as the City area

681
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,279
the in all will be overwritten when I

682
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,619
for though the ground up with probably
the helpful

683
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:36,900
both the little sure that you do that
because

684
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,410
the OS always use virtual number a

685
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,109
you don't believe that we are having
been remember did I get over here

686
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,259
is not virtual memory is the role
physical bees

687
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,420
all the religious though only

688
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,339
the the other the possibility in

689
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:59,060
or him

690
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:04,069
given a former sister is

691
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:07,749
people will you need who luminol yes

692
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:11,520
or are you human you on earth

693
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,820
girl my mom all

694
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,020
per month 100 ballpark

695
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,200
and yes you have a own I think the

696
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,600
most you guys will remember the old PC
issues have little memory so

697
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,640
that missus it was awful memory

698
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,920
the so it will do

699
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,160
Julio a Molinari who was it doesn't
really do that anymore

700
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,049
both the the judy is good measure on
asserted that you're a bus

701
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,160
and the love do the Brawlers

702
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,390
but also help but doesn't like to be
perpetuating every system

703
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,180
yeah as a

704
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,029
so but of course they don't think that
you can do

705
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,930
the I'm particular

706
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,819
spend it you don't really mole whether
the BIOS

707
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,500
low horrible obstacles you will find
when you you

708
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,880

need a beloved little hope for then
won't be admitted

745
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,439
their decisions less

yes low you use for your over after he
will %uh vision the

750
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,160
is the he's or wages incurred to the

751
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,509
are very little you can store youthful

752
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:01,960
burgers in there is really no where else
the moment you can store these the

753
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,480
memory

754
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,220
they have been both both the in though
another processor

755
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:11,089
manufactures implemented by a small

756
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:15,170
registered he specifically that would
probably make it look harder

757
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,690
Yahoo though after just published a
paper form of water yeah

758
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,070
will play hiding possibly the cryptic
actually between the CPU runs

759
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,380
yet member I just want

760
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,220
33 I just so fickle tribunal as the

761
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,459
in the up registers most persistent

762
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,510
stores goal though

763
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,510
as always stores over health the memory
the

764
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,210
yeah though if you talk about 11 ish
involving

765
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,969
the

766
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:48,329
division political than this is a

767
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:51,690
faithful so you love problem there the

768
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,100
for this one this the

769
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,990
sure there are no over okay

770
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,729
we have we will I will be where

771
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:06,640
sending who yet

772
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,920
if this thing gotta you have spaces

773
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,849
you program phone

774
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:19,520
look reisch for my lover with limited

775
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,609
we you

776
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:26,650
was yeah yeah

777
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:32,299
low you

778
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:36,599
I'll injuries over

779
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:41,849
the again is long as you keep use of
verification

780
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,789
the do home about the hardware store
them

781
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:49,220
you were you for

782
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:53,500
heard this

783
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,000
along yes

784
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,720
it

785
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,649
lies the problem with the figures in
this release or

786
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:08,190
you actually get because niggas loren is
only as strong as the

787
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,550
number appear reviews yeah and the

788
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:15,810
harder to you all that and shit
hard-driving

789
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:19,779
productive his organs or builders

790
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,310
winter I'll

791
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,910
I'm a vision we will talk love

792
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:35,069
both there's no I don't know tell you
the basis long really very much

793
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:39,950
inside a school the laptop you'll be
remiss

794
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,359
special equipment a firewire cables

795
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,400
the capital communities the

796
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,140
yeah

797
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,190
the time her mother I is all

798
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,410
global well

799
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:04,299
when he took a little up enough to do
this you wanted to the reason

800
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:08,069
I think I may have to go to the store in
his eye we were up the

801
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:09,710
unwilling land

802
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:13,089
Baltimore internationally with Google

803
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:17,640
village owns we were testing the a very
special machine which

804
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,720
was basically a easy but it was a

805
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,319
in another special loss and it was
designed

806
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,450
here unless she's they held in a those
levels of Mormon

807
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,470
for for without maintenance for a very
long time and it was for

808
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,848
it was the partners persian
