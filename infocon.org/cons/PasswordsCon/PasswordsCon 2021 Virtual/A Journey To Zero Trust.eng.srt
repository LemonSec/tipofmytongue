1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
the next talk presented by

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
ground one two three four is journeyed

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
to zero trust

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,440
joshua danielson and brittany little

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,160
delete garzarda

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,920
hello my name is brittany little i'm

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,279
from copart and we

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,279
are going to give you all some insight

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,880
into our journey to zero trust

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
so our agenda for the day we're going to

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
start with a quick intro

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
of the team then we're going to go into

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
what xero trust is

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
what it means to us specifically we're

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
going to discuss

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
our solutions that we've come up with

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,520
and

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
that we ended up choosing and provide

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
some insight into some of the lessons

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,879
we've learned so far

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,399
that we think are key to having a

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,320
successful deployment and we're going to

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
close with how we plan to expand our

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,760
zero trust journey

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,840
and then we will give some closing

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,399
points

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480
so i focus more on the product

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,440
management

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
here at copart and my primary focus is

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
around identifying security risks

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
developing strategic implementation

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,439
plans for security products

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,040
and then communicating with key

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,159
stakeholders so

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
hi everyone myself dileep gorazada head

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
of absence co-part

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,759
with my background in security

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
automation and engineering

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
allowed me to build and deploy solutions

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,920
for wide range of use cases at copper

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
and josh danielson i'm chief information

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,159
security officer here at copart

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,840
uh being here for quite a few years i've

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,119
had the opportunity to work with a lot

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,400
of great people and do some

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
do some great things here uh so diving

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
into the next slide

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,880
uh some caveats before we jump in uh

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,240
what is zero trust

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,040
well there's no one-size-fits-solution

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
for everyone anyone who spends some time

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,759
in the space know there's a lot of

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
controversy and debates of what zero

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,720
trust even means

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,240
um the industry still lacks some

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
standardization with the sa

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
sase to zero trust networking access and

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,759
otherwise too

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,119
so we've for the purpose of this

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,640
conversation we've structured it in a

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
few different uh categories of use cases

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,959
and also solutions to help us have a

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,639
good talk and hopefully have some value

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,239
to some other people understand what's a

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:12,800
good

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
use case for your programs too um

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
a lot of organizations i know focus on

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
replacing uh their vpn products and

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
solutions with the xero trust or an sae

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
based type of solution

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
uh for this purposes we're actually not

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
going to focus too much on vpns

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
as a lot of our applications and

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,400
resources actually on the cloud

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
so we'll talk a little bit about those

76
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,519
use cases but i know that the primary

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
use case that a lot of organizations

78
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
function on that's not

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
our primary use case here um also the

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
last piece i know the traditional

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
uh industry standard may be even focused

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
around pattern matching and different

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,280
track

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
traffic patterns um that's not a case

85
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,560
what we'll be covering

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
here so with that we'll dive in and talk

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
a little bit more

88
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,280
yep so same question that josh has asked

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
what is zero trust

90
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,519
and there's a couple different

91
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
definitions floating around and we went

92
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,959
ahead and just pulled one

93
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,640
from cloudflare that says zerotrust

94
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
security is an i.t security model that

95
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,599
requires strict

96
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,080
identity verification for every person

97
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
and device trying to access resources on

98
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,519
a private network

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
regardless of whether they are sitting

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,040
within or outside of the network

101
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
perimeter

102
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
so again this is just one of the general

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,760
definitions that's out there

104
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560
but this could mean zero trust could

105
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,280
still mean

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,319
different things to different

107
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
organizations depending on the situation

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
use cases that you've defined

109
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
so really just have to continue to ask

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,560
questions like are we

111
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
specifically talking about corporate

112
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
owned workstations that are connecting

113
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
to cloud apps

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
or on-prem apps are we referring to

115
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:40,879
doing

116
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,400
device authentication of these or are we

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
also looking at the doing a device

118
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
health check

119
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
in addition are we including personal

120
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
mobile devices or personal workstations

121
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
and then also again are we going to be

122
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
doing device authentication and device

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
health of those mobile devices as well

124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,519
so

125
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,879
really just continuing to ask these

126
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
questions and and that's what we did

127
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,680
to ultimately help us define what xero

128
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,239
trust

129
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,959
was to copart and so we really started

130
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,840
evaluating

131
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
what we already had in place today and

132
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
we use an idp to do things like sso and

133
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
mfa

134
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
to evaluate identity but the next step

135
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,519
for us in xero trust was specifically

136
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,479
focusing on

137
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
device authentication and device health

138
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,919
and

139
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,759
we want to ensure that all corporate

140
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
owned workstations that connect to our

141
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,400
email

142
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
and internal apps are authenticated with

143
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
a xero trust digital certificate that

144
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
includes mfa as well

145
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
and then additionally each of the

146
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
workstations must pass a device health

147
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,080
check

148
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
so this is really meaning they they must

149
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,000
have things like antivirus

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
network security and encryption enabled

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,199
in the future we do want to add

152
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,960
additional security requirements on the

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
health side but this is the baseline

154
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,160
that we started with

155
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
if both of these things are fulfilled on

156
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
a corporate owned device

157
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
we will the the device will gain access

158
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
to our specific resources

159
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
if there is no zero trust agent

160
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,039
installed or the device has a low trust

161
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,759
score

162
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
meaning it's missing crowdstrike or

163
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,360
umbrella or something like that then

164
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
they're not going to gain access to our

165
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
co-part resources

166
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
again this is just what we've done to

167
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,240
define what zero trust means to us

168
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
now i'm going to pass it off to delete

169
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
so he can talk a little bit more about

170
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
how we define

171
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
our access use cases

172
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,479
thank you brittany so to define our use

173
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,720
cases we need to identify the services

174
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
or apps we want to protect

175
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
and also the consumers of these services

176
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
say an user

177
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,800
or an application service itself based

178
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
on who is accessing what we have

179
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
categorized zero trust use cases as we

180
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,360
love

181
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,680
if you see one of these cases user to

182
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
cloud consider if your

183
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,320
company is using a lot of software as a

184
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
service applications

185
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,160
like salesforce slag zoom office 365 etc

186
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
and in these scenarios are you utilizing

187
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
any mobile device management solutions

188
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,000
to handle workstations or endpoints and

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
then the second

190
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
use case is

191
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,919
around user to on-prem services

192
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
in this scenario consider if your

193
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
company is trying to protect

194
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
internal tcp services like rdp ssh

195
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
or https and typical answers

196
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,880
include network access control solutions

197
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,960
or basically vpns that are out there

198
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
that can help you provide these remote

199
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
access

200
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,639
especially during this fandom and then

201
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
the third use case is machine to machine

202
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
in a typical virtual machine deployments

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,479
based

204
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
deployments production application

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,560
environment allows all traffic from one

206
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
server to the other

207
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,039
or may not be restricted by a network so

208
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
our usage should be restricted only to

209
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,599
add traffic from a server or container

210
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,840
but in a container-based deployments we

211
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
use calico policies

212
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,800
or service mesh architecture to provide

213
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
network level access

214
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
or application based access consider

215
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
if there is any orchestration tool is

216
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
needed say docker or kubernetes

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,840
for managing these machine to machine

218
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
access

219
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
so once we know our use cases we have

220
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
below zero trust solution categories in

221
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
the market

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,199
so in a typical network-based solution

223
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,759
type

224
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
an employee accessing office 65 is not

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
directly allowed

226
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,319
as you can see an idp is required for

227
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
the employee to access these

228
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,919
cloud solution and the xero trust

229
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
is the solution that is helping the

230
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
employee to provide device heart

231
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,919
device help and device search for the

232
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,120
employee to access these cloud solutions

233
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
and in this scenario endpoint agent is

234
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
not needed

235
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,599
on the network based deployments

236
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,960
employee accessing

237
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,759
office 65 is denied and you require an

238
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
idp to access it

239
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,199
and our zero trust solution is actually

240
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,960
integrated with idp

241
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,319
to allow the process flow or access flow

242
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,919
to this application

243
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,240
in this scenario the idp is directly

244
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
tied to zero trust solutions so only

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
traffic coming from

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
zero trust gateway is allowed to be

247
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,280
accessed

248
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,639
in this scenario employee have an

249
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,720
endpoint agent deployed on each device

250
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
and all the traffic field goes through

251
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,440
that endpoint agent and routes through

252
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
the zero trust gateway before it reaches

253
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,519
to the actual

254
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,958
office 365.

255
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,679
and then the third one is search based

256
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,200
deployments where

257
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,560
employees still needs to go through idp

258
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
to access these office 365 but in this

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
scenario these idps are directly tied to

260
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,880
these

261
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,720
zero trust solutions to allow continuous

262
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
checks on device health and trust in

263
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
this scenario employee provides this

264
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
certificate and health through the agent

265
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
installed on the

266
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
end point and it continuously monitors

267
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
through the gateway and then the gateway

268
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
is going to work with idp

269
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,560
to allow or not allow the access

270
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
let's dive more into these solution

271
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
types and see

272
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
some of our findings in these scenarios

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
on the network-based type of deployments

274
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
it's the most traditional definition

275
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
of zero trash like josh mentioned this

276
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
just provides the bare metal

277
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,080
zero thrust solution here and it's an

278
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
easiest or quickest to deploy as they

279
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,360
integrate with mobile device management

280
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
solutions so it's a plug-in needed to be

281
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,880
added to

282
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
web browser since it's a

283
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
easy deployment in that part of things

284
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
in this scenario device

285
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,959
health is having a least priority as you

286
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,640
require a different source to provide

287
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,880
that

288
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
and it might be the easiest way to

289
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
replace your vpn as well

290
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
let's move on to the next one which is

291
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
the net based

292
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
endpoint based on the network side of

293
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,079
things

294
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,440
deployment this is this is similar to a

295
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
vpn based solution

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
and as you can see are talked about in

297
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
the access flow we need a gateway in

298
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,640
here and the gateway should be

299
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,839
restricting

300
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,079
the traffic to these idp or the actual

301
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,120
applications

302
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
so in that in that scope we require the

303
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,800
applications to support ib restrictions

304
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
and in this type of solution deployments

305
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
consider if any

306
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
privacy issues are encountered up front

307
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,240
uh as as example the gateway might be

308
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
looking at traffic if you're not

309
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,040
properly configured

310
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
the end point might be looking at all

311
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
the traffic irrespective of

312
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
corporate traffic or your personal

313
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
traffic

314
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
and what we have seen so far is these

315
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,839
solutions require

316
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,040
the app to run all the time and it might

317
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
include running on your mobile devices

318
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,240
which might incur a lot of battery life

319
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
etc and then the third one is search

320
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,000
based

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
deployments where in the end point you

322
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,120
have an

323
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
agent installed that provides the device

324
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
and device health this uh apps or this

325
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,279
type of deployments basically

326
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,880
require digital certificate to be

327
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
presented whenever you try to access any

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
sas application for device

329
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
authentication and also the agent must

330
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
be

331
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
compliant with with the device health

332
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,120
policies like brittany mentioned before

333
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
and this requires integration for

334
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
cloud-based resources

335
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,440
and probably less concerned less privacy

336
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
concern as

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
compared to the network based as it

338
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
might not need to

339
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
look at all the traffic that goes

340
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
through the application

341
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,959
and it shouldn't be passing through the

342
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,439
gateway

343
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,800
let's look at the solutions

344
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
and the gaps we have found across the

345
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
different types of products which we

346
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
have evaluated during our

347
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,040
poc of these solutions

348
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
one one type of the product is basically

349
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,079
these are

350
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
like cost is uh very

351
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
affordable to the companies and

352
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,079
leadership uh is very

353
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
like good and in the sense of management

354
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
and also tool development kind of things

355
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
but the problem we have faced is the

356
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
product maturity they only solve certain

357
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,760
use cases not

358
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
not all use cases that we might be

359
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
looking at

360
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
and also the problem with the product

361
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
maturity being

362
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
there they have defined uh updates that

363
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,240
are

364
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,200
already being managed and for the

365
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,680
product

366
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,360
two uh type of uh this is another type

367
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,800
of solution probably

368
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
around the network based you can see the

369
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,200
it's a new

370
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
solutions that are out in the market and

371
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,959
it's been very successful in

372
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
in being utilized by many companies and

373
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
the main problems we have seen so far

374
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
with them is

375
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
employee experience around mobile apps

376
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
as i mentioned this could involve

377
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
the kind of vpn deployment on those

378
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,200
devices and continuously

379
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,560
be on which might which might consume

380
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,240
battery life of those devices

381
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
and and also on the product three

382
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
we you can see it's similar to the

383
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,120
similar to the network page it's an

384
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
endpoint based

385
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,160
it has the same upside around the market

386
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,600
penetration

387
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,519
and it has provided a lot of value for

388
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,200
device health and trust compared to the

389
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,199
other solutions as well

390
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
and most of these solutions have kept in

391
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,279
mind are

392
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
being managed by multiple companies have

393
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,639
helped them shape the product very much

394
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,959
defined for the new use cases that are

395
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,040
coming up for example continuous device

396
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
health and trust

397
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,040
and the major disadvantages of constant

398
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,880
disease

399
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,720
considering that like trust coverage or

400
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
health coverage across different types

401
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,920
of

402
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,000
devices and also different types of

403
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
operating systems say

404
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,279
linux windows and mobile devices

405
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,959
employee experience in deploying these

406
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
apps as well as

407
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,959
registration and all those have been

408
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,719
have been a difficult task for them

409
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
and finally we come back to talk about

410
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,000
who did we choose and on based on what

411
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
factors did we decide that

412
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
we we have chosen cert page deployment

413
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,000
for endpoints because of aligning

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,959
support for

415
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
technologies in use for example most of

416
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,600
these solutions require

417
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,279
to be deployed by azure or basically

418
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,560
sccm for windows deployments and also

419
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,880
some of these solutions mobile device

420
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,560
management solutions to deploy the

421
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
software across different

422
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,480
platforms say windows or mac

423
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
environments depending on

424
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
what type of endpoints do you have and

425
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
flexible device health policies which

426
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
which means like brittany mentioned

427
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,079
before

428
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,880
this could be anywhere ranging from do

429
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,760
you have your

430
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,800
uh endpoint antivirus solution running

431
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
do you have your network

432
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,959
network um security solution running on

433
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
your device or configured with that

434
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
or do you have data encryption in place

435
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
for different types of

436
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,160
platforms say mac os or

437
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,440
windows or android to support the

438
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,839
use cases like personal mobile devices

439
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,320
to be secured as well

440
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
and uh the next one is co-party savion's

441
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,720
sas applications as as josh mentioned

442
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,519
before

443
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
most of our use cases is around

444
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
protecting our sas apps

445
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,519
and some of our in-house build solutions

446
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,120
that are tied with

447
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
tied with our idp solutions to provide

448
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
sso and mfa

449
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
and endpoint or cert based solution

450
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
directly integrating with

451
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,399
idp solutions have helped us to even

452
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,079
cover most of our

453
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,120
http based apps within our company or

454
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,759
internal apps

455
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
and search based solution actually

456
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,519
helping us to provide device

457
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,759
device trust in continuous basis and

458
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,240
also being monitored continuously

459
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
so some of these solutions ideally come

460
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
up with managing these device

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,639
certificates

462
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
as well so that has helped us in

463
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,320
in deploying these software solutions

464
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,839
within our environment

465
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,560
and this typically so these solutions do

466
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,399
not typically replace vpn

467
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,920
in the sense they don't work on the

468
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
network page layer so you don't need to

469
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
change the underlying protocols we have

470
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,959
already

471
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,519
and endpoint search base these mostly

472
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,759
run on the application layer

473
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
in the sense all these are https traffic

474
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,199
and being

475
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,800
and being monitored for any anomalies or

476
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
basically blocking the traffic based on

477
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,280
your device health and trust

478
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
finally the vendor had strong technical

479
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
leadership team and vision

480
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,559
working with our leadership teams we

481
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,160
were able to

482
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
meet co-part use cases and being

483
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,280
flexible in deploying these solutions

484
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,599
to us

485
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,240
let me pass it on to brittany for

486
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
some of our deployment cabinets yep

487
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,799
instantly

488
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
so before we talk a little bit more in

489
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,720
detail about how we actually deployed

490
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
this and some of the

491
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
some of the roadblocks that we ran into

492
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,039
um i want to give a little bit

493
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
of detail about our environment

494
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
specifically so you can have a better

495
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,880
understanding

496
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
at copart we have about 8 000 employees

497
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,240
located

498
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
in 12 different countries about 1500 to

499
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
2000 employees are considered

500
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
corporate employees but the remaining

501
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
large portion

502
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
do work in our yards and are more

503
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,039
considered to not be

504
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,520
technical employees blue collar workers

505
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,320
so

506
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,600
um really having to pay attention to

507
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
anything that requires a lot of

508
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
technical knowledge in terms of

509
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
enrollment and things like that

510
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
we had to be careful about about those

511
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
things but

512
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
now as we walk through as we worked

513
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,280
through this deployment

514
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,600
we ran across many lessons learned and

515
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,039
really want to highlight some key items

516
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,080
that we think

517
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,799
are useful for a successful deployment

518
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,600
so

519
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
our first one is getting leadership

520
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
buy-in

521
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,799
from the initial purchasing of a product

522
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,360
to the technical side to even the end

523
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,840
user experience the leadership buy-in

524
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
was needed at all ends of the spectrum

525
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,039
to help us push the deployment

526
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
because we had to rely heavily on

527
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
different teams to help us

528
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
do things like creating packages and

529
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,720
integrating with different systems and

530
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,120
trying to push employees to help us

531
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,039
volunteer for pilot testing

532
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,760
and getting that feedback and ensuring

533
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,600
that you know we've tested for all of

534
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,679
issues that could occur with so many of

535
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,640
these different groups

536
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
being involved it was so important for

537
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,559
the overall zero trust strategy

538
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,520
to be prioritized from top down and

539
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
ensure that that buy-in is coming from

540
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,000
the leadership

541
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
first so for the second one

542
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
um another thing we really wanted to pay

543
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
attention to was

544
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,880
privacy transparency so early on we

545
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
started to see areas where

546
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
employees were getting concerned with

547
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
the information being tracked by

548
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,919
the product being installed on more so

549
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
their mobile devices but sometimes on

550
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,240
the

551
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,120
desktops as well so in addition to the

552
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
much needed leadership buy-in that we

553
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,919
just spoke about

554
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,640
the the buy-in and support from legal in

555
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,280
hr

556
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,480
was was even more important

557
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,640
because we realized we needed to be very

558
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,000
transparent with the employees

559
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
about the information that the app was

560
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
tracking and we did this by

561
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,280
getting privacy statements in agreements

562
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,679
with

563
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,159
the product signed and ensuring that

564
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,600
these agreements between us and the

565
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,159
product were provided to the employee

566
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
in the initial introduction of the

567
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
enrollment phase and anytime we

568
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
started to involve the employee we

569
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,799
ensured that you know

570
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
we were able to make them feel as

571
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,120
comfortable as possible

572
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
and from a privacy perspective so

573
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
for some use cases if people had

574
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,480
more questions then we even looked to

575
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,880
have

576
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
demos available for some employees that

577
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,960
allowed them to see

578
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,360
the backend data and logs that we would

579
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
see in the console like hey this

580
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
is this is the information we're seeing

581
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,400
this is the information we're pulling

582
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
that way we can just be as transparent

583
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
as possible and making them feel as

584
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
comfortable as possible

585
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,520
number three kind of ties directly into

586
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
number two

587
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,559
saving the difficult people for last was

588
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,320
something that we realized could help

589
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,640
us push forward and show progress in the

590
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,159
deployment

591
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
every company has some group of

592
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
employees that either have legitimate

593
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,159
concerns or

594
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,039
simply don't want to participate or have

595
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
extra privacy concerns and so

596
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
we just thought that focusing on the

597
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,440
larger majority that were willing to

598
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,919
participate and willing to help us push

599
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
along in the deployment

600
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,159
would be the best approach and then once

601
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,679
we enroll

602
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,720
and get about 98 to 99 of the company

603
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,840
completed

604
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
um you know we roll back around to those

605
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
difficult people

606
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
last and we say hey you know again

607
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
making the film more comfortable and

608
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,159
saying

609
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,480
we have enrolled this many people and

610
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
everyone is supporting this so

611
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,760
um now what else can we do to to get you

612
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,559
on board with this

613
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
so

614
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
the next one is addressing the hard

615
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
topics so

616
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
really you can tell um obviously we're

617
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
trying to

618
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,159
solve challenges of device

619
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
authentication and device health across

620
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,840
the organization with our

621
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,240
strategy um but we're also looking to be

622
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
able to provide better solutions for

623
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
things like byod

624
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,919
and securing personal devices device use

625
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,880
cases

626
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,600
as well so addressing that this will be

627
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
a challenge that we'll run into but also

628
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,240
one that

629
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
with this grander strategy we'll be able

630
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,080
to solve and provide a better solution

631
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
for

632
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
so for number five the upfront effort to

633
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
ensure easy enrollment is well worth it

634
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,559
um i've mentioned user experience a

635
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
couple different times

636
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,840
and this really became our main priority

637
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,960
the deployment really can't be

638
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,880
successful when employees are unwilling

639
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,559
to work with you or you're not making it

640
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,520
easy for them

641
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,600
so to be honest when we first started

642
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
the deployment of our xero trust

643
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
solution the end user experience was not

644
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,120
as high on our priority list as it

645
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
should have been

646
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
originally the enrollment process uh

647
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
for xero trust on workstations and

648
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
mobile totaled about

649
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
12 to 15 enrollment steps for the

650
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
employee

651
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,120
which is obviously causing a hassle to

652
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
not only them

653
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,159
um that all the people that are

654
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,000
enrolling and having to follow these

655
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
instructions but also

656
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,080
our security team and other teams that

657
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,679
are helping us you know the

658
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
support teams and anyone else that's

659
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,720
receiving calls

660
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
um there were times where we were having

661
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,840
to handle tens and twenties of

662
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,679
individual calls with questions and

663
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,760
people getting stuck in the enrollment

664
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
and they couldn't figure out what their

665
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,600
next step was even with the very

666
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,760
detailed instructions that you know

667
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
we took feedback and we edited over and

668
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,919
over there was just too many steps

669
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
in the enrollment process and so really

670
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,480
we had to take a step back

671
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
as a security team and say okay how can

672
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,159
we um

673
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
take this feedback and fix this process

674
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,080
how can we suppress as much of these

675
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,120
steps

676
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,480
that it takes so what we did was

677
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
our team worked with some other internal

678
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,919
teams of copart and then we also worked

679
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,120
with the product

680
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,279
engineers and we were able to

681
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,360
ensure that the workstation enrollment

682
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
is actually now

683
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,760
zero touch it doesn't require any

684
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
engagement from the employee it just

685
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
triggers off of the octa login

686
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,679
and then the mobile enrollment is

687
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,760
actually down to two to three steps

688
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,279
so really this this effort on the back

689
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,279
end has by far been the most impactful

690
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,640
change that we've seen

691
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,279
um to our zero trust deployment so far

692
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,559
and then lastly if you haven't already

693
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,279
noticed

694
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,039
the main component of each of the

695
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
bullets that i've spoken about before

696
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,960
is communication and coordination it

697
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
from scheduling testing identifying

698
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,919
individual users and device names per

699
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,760
department per country

700
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,840
coordinating and collaborating for all

701
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,120
the things needed to make this a

702
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,200
successful deployment

703
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,679
cannot be undervalued and it has to be

704
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,400
uh

705
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
it has to be really important to to the

706
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,200
team for a successful deployment

707
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
so i'm going to pass off to delete so he

708
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
can give some insight into what we are

709
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,480
planning to do next

710
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
as you can see we have tackled

711
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
the use cases of user to cloud but the

712
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,799
coming up

713
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,760
what we are looking for is user

714
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,320
accessing any of our internal services

715
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,559
which could be advanced remote access

716
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,039
for engineers which is not a typical vpn

717
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,440
but we like to see device health and

718
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,159
trust

719
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
at the same time while they're accessing

720
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
ssh or rdp

721
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,880
services to our remote systems and then

722
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
the other one that we are trying to

723
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
tackle is machine-to-machine deployment

724
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
since we are we have identified or

725
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,960
addressed

726
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,760
all the concerns within our internal

727
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,559
architecture

728
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,600
as well as the internal teams we have

729
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,520
identified what is our next step to

730
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,720
deploy

731
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
zero trust within our machine to machine

732
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,799
deployment so that

733
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,240
we can only ensure app traffic has been

734
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,200
has been uh locked between these two

735
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,799
servers and now the traffic is allowed

736
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,279
to be flow

737
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,840
let me pass it back to britain yep so

738
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,039
as we mentioned a couple of different

739
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,120
times we've we've needed a lot of help

740
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
from others within our team that are not

741
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,000
here presenting today and also external

742
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
teams within copart

743
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
but we did want to highlight a few other

744
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
members on our team that continue to

745
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,559
play a key role in our deployment

746
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,559
so just want to give thanks there

747
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,559
and then uh as we close out really

748
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,039
we have a couple key takeaways and one

749
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,640
of those is being transparent

750
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
really at all levels of leadership teams

751
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
that are involved in the deployment

752
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,400
and employees being transparent is is

753
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
the biggest piece

754
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,760
and so we really want if you take

755
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,720
anything away

756
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,760
take this one and also the next one is

757
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
know your use cases

758
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,679
define what zero trust means to you and

759
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,320
your organization because it can vary

760
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,640
and there probably isn't going to be a

761
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
product that's able to solve

762
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
all of your use cases that you came up

763
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,799
with because

764
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,559
many of the solutions are still maturing

765
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,720
so the more you know your use cases the

766
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,000
better you can prioritize

767
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,679
them and the better you're going to be

768
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,880
able to find a solution that's going to

769
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
work for you

770
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,360
and this maturing industry so

771
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,120
that's all we have for you and thank you

772
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,520
hey it's uh jeremy and baby doll here

773
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
and we're with uh

774
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,919
jay dileep and brittany and

775
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,399
you just listen to them talk about uh

776
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,039
their journey to zero trust

777
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,960
uh the first question is what was the

778
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,880
main goal of your xero trust deployment

779
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,320
and do you feel that you've achieved it

780
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
yeah um so because everyone always has

781
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,320
their own definition of

782
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,520
zero trust that's why we try to

783
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,039
emphasize that so much at the very

784
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,320
beginning

785
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,159
our goal was to ensure that every device

786
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,080
that has some type of authentication in

787
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
this case for us is

788
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
having a digital certificate and also

789
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,640
passes um

790
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,799
a device health check as well too

791
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,720
against all of our resources primarily

792
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,159
of course it comes on the cloud side of

793
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,760
things for an octa customer i think that

794
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,120
was probably pretty obvious throughout

795
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,840
the talk

796
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
and then also for on-prem resources as

797
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
well uh we're still in the middle of the

798
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
phase rollout right now this is

799
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
something that's definitely not done

800
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,919
within a few months period

801
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,240
across around 8 000 different assets uh

802
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,720
or

803
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,039
a good-sized organization s p 500

804
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,799
fortune fortune 1000 so we have to be

805
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,080
very mindful of different kind of

806
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,760
customer bases different countries and

807
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
what not to and time schedules too

808
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,039
so oh yeah absolutely

809
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
okay next question is how do you deploy

810
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,039
and manage your certificates to make

811
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,200
sure access is limited to just the

812
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
devices that you've allowed

813
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,399
or do you allow logins from any device

814
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,559
so the specific solution we end up going

815
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
with does the certificate management

816
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
fully transparent to us

817
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
so it's not an issue at all it's just

818
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
pretty much saying the agent is kind of

819
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,559
a

820
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,880
proxy for it a lot of other solutions

821
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,399
even some very mature solutions don't

822
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,240
even do that piece for you at all though

823
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,000
um there's really prominent series c

824
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
kind of company uh that we

825
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,279
really like a lot that actually doesn't

826
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,720
do any of it for you you have to

827
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,399
maintain your own pki your whole

828
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,000
certificate store as well too

829
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,840
so but we've also heard a lot of other

830
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,120
customers are able to do different

831
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,559
things they key off like maybe if it's

832
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,399
just part of your domain or some type of

833
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:12,960
ssi

834
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
something of some other uh signature

835
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
that they want to be okay but obviously

836
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,760
this certificate is always nice

837
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,919
to have you can okay so the uh follow up

838
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,880
question to that is

839
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,600
see you loading agents on every endpoint

840
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,000
correct

841
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
and that maintains it yeah

842
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,799
okay great looks like we have one more

843
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,559
question coming in but it uh they're

844
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,279
still typing

845
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:41,840
so we'll wait for him

846
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,279
while we're waiting for the next

847
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
question um oh wait we just got we just

848
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,440
got the question never mind

849
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
no more uh donated what do you do about

850
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,760
printers and

851
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
uh devices with no agent capabilities

852
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,000
that's a good question

853
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,679
um delete i can take this one if you

854
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,960
want did you want to take a chance to

855
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
shake a shot at it though

856
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,559
you can go ahead josh okay uh so within

857
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,080
our context we're really focusing on the

858
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
data itself so we're really focusing on

859
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,559
the data

860
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,799
the actual repository so if any access

861
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,559
that's any access point or any endpoint

862
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,080
that's going to be accessing the data or

863
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
the email or database or something along

864
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,200
those lines

865
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
so iot and our environment i think we're

866
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,159
really fortunate we're going to have a

867
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,360
lot of need for a lot of these other

868
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,919
products

869
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,200
that that really focus on we have

870
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,039
printers obviously but we're not a huge

871
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,640
iot shop

872
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,039
so we really focus on the data scopes

873
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,480
printers for the most part are having a

874
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,600
lot of one-off issues

875
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,679
so uh it hasn't been a core part of our

876
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,159
definition

877
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,320
okay great and what was the net cost

878
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,120
decrease or

879
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,600
increase what was the main selling point

880
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,039
and what are some

881
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,559
other points um

882
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
i think the net cost increase or

883
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,600
decrease i don't know what i don't know

884
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,159
what the

885
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,240
baseline is due like it was comparison

886
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,159
right now before we had nothing for zero

887
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,720
trust right

888
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,480
zero trust was a net new line item on

889
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,559
our budget though it wasn't replacing

890
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,519
anything else although

891
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,399
i guess someone could see it

892
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,080
supplementing something else like an mdm

893
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,519
but we don't see it as a

894
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,360
we saw it as a separate line i'm not

895
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,799
sure if that uh

896
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,440
answers the question though no i think

897
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
that's a good answer uh perhaps a

898
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,240
more um targeted question would be like

899
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,679
what did you think the total cost of

900
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,519
deployment was

901
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,559
um okay

902
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,240
so the tool itself it depends on what

903
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,919
stage you get a company for sure if you

904
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,200
get a series a and you think you're

905
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,600
going to be

906
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,919
valuable uh to be kind of like a design

907
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:34,880
partner and give them a lot of

908
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
constructive feedback

909
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,679
for our case i think with the who we

910
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,279
decide to partner with we're in a

911
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:39,840
different

912
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,919
demographic geographically and we also

913
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,200
have a lot of different value-add

914
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,480
because we're into retail vertical we

915
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,399
had a lot more funny use cases

916
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,159
uh or actually funny but they're

917
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,440
different and challenging to an area

918
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,880
that they saw was a market they want to

919
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
be able to tackle so in retail we got

920
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,559
one-to-many issues we got one device and

921
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,519
many employees

922
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,120
that was a nuanced piece i think we had

923
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,320
an opportunity to be able to work with

924
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
this specific vendor we work with to

925
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
deal add some value

926
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,559
okay excellent it looks like we have one

927
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,320
more question coming in we'll wait for

928
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,039
them to type that

929
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,799
why so many trust issues

930
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,360
i mean we had started on our zero trust

931
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,120
journey like two years ago or

932
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,559
two and a half years ago something like

933
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,080
that too so i think we got really

934
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
fortunate that uh we're a little bit

935
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,519
ahead of the game in that kind of way

936
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,919
of course now everyone's talking buy it

937
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,039
in dividend administration

938
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,240
wall street journal everyone's talking

939
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,919
about zero trust right so we really got

940
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,960
fortunate that we were a little bit

941
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,919
ahead of the game on this piece

942
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
excellent okay it looks like um the last

943
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
question is would you be willing to

944
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,399
provide more specifics

945
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
and product information offline in our

946
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,679
discord channel

947
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,279
oh yeah absolutely we're not doing it to

948
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,640
hide any information we just don't want

949
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
to make it a product shaming bashing or

950
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,279
promoting kind of

951
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,640
situation so that's the reason why we're

952
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
kind of vague uh not at all for any

953
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
other reason though but yeah absolutely

954
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,399
well we're on talk shop all right that's

955
