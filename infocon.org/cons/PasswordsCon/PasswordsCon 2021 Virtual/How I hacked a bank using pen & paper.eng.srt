17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,160
paper form and

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,039
uh you know as the title says uh there's

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,600
uh

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,960
there's a fun story in this i couldn't

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,840
really decide

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
for the title you know whether i'm

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
talking about social engineering if i'm

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
talking about

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,559
issues with power of attorney concepts

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,520
if i'm

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,319
talking about digital identity solutions

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,880
and so on but the title is oneness

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,840
anyway here is me in front of my car or

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
my previous car but the license plate

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
is a word in norwegian which only lacks

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,680
a w

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
to make it the english equivalent you

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
can probably guess what this

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,799
and i'm really proud of saying that some

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,439
time ago

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
on on twitter i tweeted that i have a

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,080
reputation to maintain

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
that i have it durably from col mccurley

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
he's a researcher at microsoft research

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
with a witness present that uh he's

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,479
interested in passwords while i'm

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,720
obsessed with it and i asked cormac if

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,920
he could confirm that statement and he

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
responded saying confirm i have a

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
healthy curiosity while tulsa

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,399
is pathologically obsessed and this is

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,000
something that i'm actually really

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,759
proud of having that from comic early

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,000
but again back to the talk so some

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
background information i mean depending

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,159
on

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
whether you are in the us or canada or

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
uk or japan or australia or the

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,119
cayman islands or in norway uh some

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,240
background information

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,919
is necessary because again this talk is

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,480
about specific uh stuff that you can

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,440
find only in norway at the moment

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
first of all everyone does online

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,040
banking in norway

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,239
almost every single adult from age

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
15 and upwards are using online banking

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520
be it usually using apps on

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
android or ios but also those of course

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
they're using just a web browser on a

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
normal computer to log into online bank

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
and in norway we also have a solution

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
called bank id

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,319
which is used by everyone it's a common

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
authentication an electronic signature

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,519
solution

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
it's an identity solution and in full

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
disclosure i now work

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
for vips in norway the company who is

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,720
the developer and sells the bank id

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
solution as well as some other solutions

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
i started working for them on march 1st

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,839
2021

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,120
but there is a situation in norway not

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,000
everyone

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,879
is actually online there are some people

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,200
that

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
for different reasons they could be old

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
they could be disabled or they are just

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
you know a bit too paranoid

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
and they are not using or they are not

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
willing to be online they don't want to

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,239
use

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
online banking as an example so

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,640
for a few cases

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
we need all the banks in all we need to

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
support them in other ways than just

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,159
having a web page or an app for a phone

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,080
so for several years we have had

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,959
something called

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
disposition in norwegian with norwegian

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,720
banks

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
i tried to find you know an exact

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
translation of this intimately english

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,319
and the best way to describe

102
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,640
it is to provide power of eternity to

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
somebody else to handle your bank

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
account

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,239
so if say you're blind you're all

106
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
disabled or you're just truly paranoid

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,680
and you want somebody else to handle

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,239
your

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,040
business in your online bank you will

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
provide a power of attorney to somebody

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,798
else and when you're using bank id it's

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,079
a two-factor

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,639
authentication solution where you have a

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
username

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
you have a password and you also have an

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,919
otp that you will provide

117
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,160
and of course the banks have been saying

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
since day one with bank id that you

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
should never share your otp with anyone

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
and obviously you should never share

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,639
your password with anyone either

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,919
now if you are as

123
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,440
me entry in into into passwords

124
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
you do know that quite a few people will

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
share uh

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,479
their passwords and also those that will

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
share their otp tokens with other people

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
as well it's a you know it's a

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,960
matter of trust but at least for this

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
case in norway

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
the banks say you should never share

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
these secrets with

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,919
anyone including you know boyfriend

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,960
girlfriend

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,359
wife spouse you know whoever it is

136
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
now looking at this especially you know

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,639
do not share these secrets that was

138
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,560
actually a red flag to me like you know

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
i'm i'm getting

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
annoyed by this because i know that

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,720
people

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
are sharing passwords kids do it

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
teenagers do it as

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
a you know sign of trusting each other

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,039
and i know that adults do it

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
as well so i wanted to look into how

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,840
this stuff actually works especially

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,440
the power of attorney part

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
so i looked at the largest bank in in

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
norway dnb

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
uh it's uh it's a you know it's not just

152
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,160
the

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
the biggest bank in norway but but you

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,199
know by

155
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,840
far it's a lot bigger than the second

156
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
biggest bank in norway

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,759
and usually when you use bank id this is

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
completely online and you log in using

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
bank id you transfer money you pay your

160
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,479
mortgage you pay your rent you

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
pay money to people in the us and you do

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
that all online

163
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
and you never have to visit the bank

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
physically

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
actually in most cases now you

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
will never visit your bank and in the

167
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
very near future

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,039
there will be no need ever

169
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,919
to visit the bank physically again

170
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
everything will be handled online

171
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
including the process of signing up

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,039
to become a customer of a bank or to

173
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,520
get a mortgage as an example with a bank

174
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,160
no need

175
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,000
to to visit the bank physically

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
but for the power of journey concept

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
it's very

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,759
simple when you go online you can

179
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,840
register a new

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
person that will be given access to your

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
account to handle your business on your

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
behalf

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
doing that online is a very easy process

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
you have to type in the social security

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,639
number which is

186
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,440
basically our usernames in norway and

187
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,080
say that this

188
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
person will be given access to my bank

189
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
account

190
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,560
that person needs to be a member or you

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
know a customer of this

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
bank specifically at the time of sign up

193
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
uh the person needs to be 18 years of

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,479
age

195
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
or older or in order to be allowed

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,360
access to manage your bank accounts

197
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,840
and that's basically it click and click

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,960
click and

199
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,000
go and you're set

200
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,240
but i wanted to look into the

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
alternatives for this because as i said

202
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,440
not everyone is

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,720
online and can do this online

204
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
so dmb as one out of several banks

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,039
provide an alternate option you can use

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,639
a paper form

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
and send it by postal mail to the bank

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
because bank id let's just say that bank

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
id is

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,160
you know perfect it's secure

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
so i was curious about okay and so you

212
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
can fill in a paper form and send that

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
physically to the bank and by doing that

214
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
you can provide somebody else with

215
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
access to your bank account

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
and that access will then be you know

217
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
digital

218
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,879
interesting concept let's look into it

219
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
so dmb the biggest bank had this paper

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
form it was a one

221
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
page paper form looking like this it's a

222
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,039
norwegian

223
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,759
so sorry about that but i will explain a

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,319
bit

225
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,279
for you so first of all there is the

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,320
owner of the account

227
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,039
that's me i'm the victim in this case

228
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,599
and

229
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,839
i will have to or an attacker will have

230
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,679
to fill in my name

231
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,519
my address which is publicly available

232
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,800
information

233
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,880
my social security number which is

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,200
sort of a secret but it was never meant

235
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
to be a secret when the algorithm was

236
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,320
designed

237
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,760
and my bank account number now banks in

238
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
norway are not allowed

239
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
to disclose to anyone basically

240
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
your affiliation with the bank you know

241
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
if your customer your bank account

242
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,160
number and so on

243
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,440
uh but you know in a way

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
it's not much of a secret really which

245
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
bank are you using what is your bank

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,959
account number and so on if somebody is

247
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
to pay your money they

248
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
need to know your bank and your bank

249
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
account number

250
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
and then there's information about the

251
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
person that i'm providing powerful

252
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,399
attorney access for

253
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
and that is in this case going to be the

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
attacker

255
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
and i don't know this because the

256
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
attacker will be filling in this paper

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,399
form by themselves it will not be done

258
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,080
by me

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,839
so here you have the name and address

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,200
the social security number of the

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
attacker that

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,959
needs to be fill in into this paper form

263
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,399
this could be the attacker

264
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
or it could be also a money mule which

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
is again somebody

266
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,160
basically being tricked into doing

267
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,680
something illegal without actually

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
understanding what they are doing

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
and then you need a fiscal signature

270
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
from the account

271
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,600
owner and i don't know about the us if

272
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
you're using checks with signatures and

273
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,839
you if you actually do signature checks

274
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
uh still uh but in norway it's

275
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,880
you know fiscal signature what the hell

276
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,279
i

277
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,920
it's that's you know that's something we

278
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
were doing when i was

279
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
as a child and i'm gonna be 50 now uh

280
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
and wherever you go if you're asked to

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,360
sign on

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
anything you you know you just put an x

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,720
and

284
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
nobody cares anywhere

285
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
so i was curious about when we fill this

286
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,920
out will anyone

287
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,880
actually do a signature verification at

288
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,519
all

289
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
because i do know that the bank does

290
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
have my

291
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
signature on file

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
and then we also need two witnesses and

293
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
these witnesses that will you know

294
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,839
testify to

295
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
the uh to you know this form being

296
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,680
correct

297
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
and this is something that i the account

298
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
owner has done

299
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,800
um you know willingly and i do

300
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,760
understand the

301
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
consequences of doing this so they will

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,320
confirm the validity of the document in

303
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
accordance with the wishes of the

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,320
account

305
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
owner and witnesses cannot be the spouse

306
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
partner parents kids or grandchildren

307
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,040
of the account owner and i was curious

308
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
also about in this case whether these

309
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
witnesses can actually be held

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,640
accountable for signing of this document

311
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
as witnesses and i've asked lawyers

312
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
about that

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,360
and they say that probably

314
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
not actually

315
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
in case something bad happens that is

316
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
so first of all i said the norwegian

317
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,519
social security numbers are not really

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
supposed to be a secret and that's true

319
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
but the funny thing is a lot of

320
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
norwegians

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,200
still think that their social security

322
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
number is a secret and they try to keep

323
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
it secret

324
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
and what's even worse is that a lot of

325
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
businesses

326
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
are still using the social security

327
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
number as a secret

328
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,839
when it's not supposed to be used that

329
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,480
way

330
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
the algorithm for generating our social

331
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
security numbers is

332
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
not a secret at all it's a it's public

333
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,480
information

334
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,279
it's 11 digits it's my date of birth

335
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,760
from

336
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,160
mine is 10 0 9 71 so september 10 1971

337
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,720
and five more digits and these last five

338
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,600
digits

339
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
uh the middle one of them is a gender

340
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,839
indicator so odd numbers are men

341
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
and even numbers of women

342
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,040
so you need to find uh my birthday which

343
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
again is september 10 1971 and then you

344
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
can use the generator to find

345
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,639
all the possible uh social security

346
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,279
numbers for a man born on september 10

347
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
1971

348
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,880
and that's approximately 100 numbers

349
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
maybe a little bit more

350
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,040
and when you have generated those 100

351
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,680
numbers

352
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
you need to find a service that will

353
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
allow you to verify

354
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
the validity of the number meaning first

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
of all

356
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
is the number actually being used by a

357
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
real existing person

358
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,600
male person today which is alive

359
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,279
and then you need to figure out if that

360
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,000
person is me or if it is somebody else

361
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440
another man born on the same day that

362
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,440
process isn't really hard

363
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,839
so in order to validate these we will

364
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,440
look to looking around because i did

365
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
this as a project with three good

366
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,160
friends of mine

367
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
so we looked around and it's a

368
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
known fact among especially you know

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
security people and hackers that

370
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,279
there have been time and again there

371
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
have been services online

372
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,600
which will allow you to verify the

373
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,079
validity of a norwegian social security

374
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,199
number

375
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,839
so we are not disclosing any names or

376
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
logos or countries in

377
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,160
in this but we did find a service that

378
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,800
allowed us to do that

379
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,880
unauthenticated no rate limiting at

380
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,519
all and i just have a picture of her of

381
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,480
the swedish chef

382
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
without any other explanation

383
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880
but we managed to verify and

384
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
and ensure that numbers were valid and

385
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
we could also find

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
that the specific number used by me

387
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
belong to me using a specific service

388
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
that we found on the internet

389
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
so then we have a social security number

390
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
and the last thing that the attacker

391
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,600
needs is to figure out my bank account

392
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
number i did talk to the super financial

393
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
authority of the norwegian government

394
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,160
and they said well

395
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,800
your account bank account member is you

396
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
know is not a secret it's not supposed

397
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,360
to be a secret

398
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
and in many cases you have to give it to

399
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
others

400
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
if they are to pay money to you or

401
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,680
transfer money to you

402
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
and you know for some weird reason while

403
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
doing this little research project

404
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,920
i actually sold the camera lens for one

405
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,839
of my dslr cameras

406
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
to somebody else in norway and i was

407
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
going to send the camera lens

408
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,760
by uh by fiscal mail

409
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,360
to them and it's cash on arrival so they

410
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
go to the post office they

411
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,000
have to pay for the lens at the post

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,720
office

413
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
before getting the package and when they

414
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
get the package and they make the

415
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
payment

416
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
uh to the norwegian post and norwegian

417
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
post will then transfer the money to my

418
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,199
account

419
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
and i never actually thought about it

420
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:32,639
before

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,120
but filling out the information that

422
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
goes on the package

423
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
i also actually have to include my bank

424
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,519
account number

425
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,079
on the package so not only will the

426
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,680
remote post office

427
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,399
get my bank account number but the

428
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
recipient of the package

429
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,279
will also get my bank account number and

430
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
there you go so if you sell anything by

431
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,639
postal mail

432
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
that people are supposed to pay for when

433
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
they receive it they will also get your

434
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,279
bank off number so

435
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
it's sort of easy actually

436
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
but in our case we went with a bit of

437
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,079
social engineering

438
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,959
we wanted to see if we could convince a

439
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,720
customer representative

440
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
at dmv to provide my social security

441
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
number to an attacker

442
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
now a good friend of mine who's a

443
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,519
specialist in social engineering

444
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,120
he does a lot of pen testing in that

445
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,880
area here in norway he took on the

446
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,000
challenge

447
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
and he called the customer service of

448
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,680
dmb

449
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,160
now you can probably guess the outcome

450
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,800
of this

451
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
but some of the interesting things that

452
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,320
norwegian banks are doing they do

453
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
security questions and security

454
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
questions is a topic that we have been

455
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,600
talking about the passwords com

456
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
previously as well

457
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
and in my simple mind there are two

458
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
types of security questions you have

459
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
static security questions where the

460
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
answer is kind of fixed you know it

461
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,279
doesn't change in the future

462
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,040
like mother's maiden name name of first

463
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
pet name of first school and so on

464
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
and a lot of times you can

465
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
probably google your way to the answers

466
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,480
to these questions about

467
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,079
most people especially if you have

468
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
facebook of course

469
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
but then you also have dynamic security

470
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
questions which can be

471
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
maybe a little bit more tricky to bypass

472
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
it can be something like

473
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,480
name someone you made a payment to

474
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,959
during the last few days as an example

475
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,880
or they could be asking how much money

476
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
approximately do you have in

477
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
in account number one two or three that

478
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,360
you have in our bank right now

479
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,960
that can probably change for some people

480
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
it's just zero constantly

481
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,840
i don't know but again it's a question

482
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,400
about

483
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,360
how good entropy do these security

484
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
security questions have

485
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
when they are supposed to be dynamic

486
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,000
like and well i always

487
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
have zero in my account so it's rather

488
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,080
you know it's

489
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,600
not that high entropy

490
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,799
anyway we completed the paper form and

491
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,919
sent it by

492
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,280
paper mail to the bank on tuesday

493
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
afternoon

494
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,919
and then we just waited to see what

495
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,320
happened

496
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,320
boom that happened

497
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,520
we actually hit jackpot on this

498
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
and we discovered that well for the

499
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,880
first of all for the

500
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
paper form there were insufficient

501
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
insufficient controls

502
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
not only did we fill out the paper form

503
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
but we used several

504
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,520
colored ink pens to fill out a paper

505
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,480
form

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,760
we had several different people write

507
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,799
in the information so you have should i

508
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
say different fonts or writing styles on

509
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
the document

510
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,960
the two witnesses were just two random

511
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
people at a cafe

512
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,000
18 and 19 years old and i can promise

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
you they did

514
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,240
not understand what they sign up for

515
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
as witnesses and only one of them asked

516
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,799
to see some id and really didn't

517
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,840
look at our id at all i would i would

518
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
say

519
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
even more concerning is the fact that me

520
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
as the account owner and also the person

521
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,559
that i provided

522
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,320
power of attorney privilege is for which

523
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,480
is a good friend of mine but in the

524
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,000
scenario this is attacker none of us

525
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
were notified

526
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
by the bank that power of attorney

527
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,240
access

528
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,960
have now been granted and the person can

529
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,600
now

530
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
log on and use your bank account for

531
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,120
almost

532
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,480
anything they want that was that was

533
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,240
that was like that was mind-blowing

534
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
shocker to me and to everybody else as

535
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,440
well i mean

536
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,320
it's somebody get that gets access to

537
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,440
your account

538
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
and nobody notifies you all the person

539
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,799
that actually

540
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
gets a access to your account that's

541
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
insane

542
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
and not only that but the person got

543
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,919
full access

544
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
meaning that you can do everything

545
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,840
except you can't

546
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
get a mortgage or you know uh put me

547
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
into more depth

548
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,240
by having this access as an attacker

549
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
and you cannot pay

550
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
my bills for me even if i'm receiving my

551
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
bills electronically

552
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
and in norway most bills are received

553
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
electronically inside your bank

554
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
but the person with power attorney

555
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,280
privileges can't see them and can't

556
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,799
make the payment but

557
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,760
the person can see my entire payment

558
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,799
history

559
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,400
10 years back in time which is sort of

560
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,000
crazy in some cases we also found that

561
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,640
this palm attorney access

562
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
you know there are legal agreements on

563
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,559
this but they are different from bank to

564
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:48,960
bank

565
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
it's not standardized between the banks

566
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
the way you order power attorney access

567
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,360
the overview you know the way you can

568
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
look at you know the setup of this and

569
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,039
it changes to make

570
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,559
you make it because you can give a

571
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,240
powerful attorney access

572
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
to several people if you like or 100

573
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
people maybe we don't know how many you

574
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,760
can actually give it to

575
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
the use of it the logging alerting and

576
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
removal of access

577
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,159
are all different and in almost all

578
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
cases where we checked it was very hard

579
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,159
to figure out

580
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,720
what's going on who's got access what

581
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,440
have they done

582
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
what have they seen and there are no

583
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
controls for me as an account owner to

584
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,320
set up you know any limitations on what

585
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
they can do

586
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,480
or cannot do which was crazy

587
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
and we as you know just as one example

588
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
we found that one of the

589
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
legal agreements for this power attorney

590
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
access

591
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,799
had hard coded december 31

592
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,240
year 99 as the expiry date and you

593
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,679
couldn't change that

594
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
at all in the contract with the bank so

595
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
once you sign it it they will have

596
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
access into eternity or

597
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
pretty much uh or until you again

598
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,480
say that well i'm cutting the agreement

599
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,200
i don't want to do this anymore

600
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,919
and also again another shocker when i

601
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,120
logged on

602
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,960
using either the web version or the ios

603
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,240
app version of the bank online bank app

604
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,960
there was you know in the in the main

605
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,520
screen

606
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
of the bank online banking screen

607
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,640
there's no information there that

608
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
somebody now have access to your bank

609
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,200
account

610
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
nothing you can't see it you have to go

611
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,679
into several sub menus before you can

612
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,320
find

613
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
the fact that somebody else has access

614
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,080
to your bank account

615
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
which again is a shocker really

616
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
so of course this had to be this needs

617
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,520
to be fixed

618
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
and i did talk of course to the bank

619
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,280
i'll get back to that

620
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
but one of the things that we found is

621
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,799
that while using time

622
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,240
uh to do rate limiting uh and using time

623
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,720
to add

624
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,039
uh to our advantage is very important in

625
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,000
this case

626
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,799
and to the disadvantage of for criminals

627
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,200
so

628
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
if you've got an iphone maybe you have

629
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,200
entered the wrong pin code a couple of

630
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,240
times and you've seen

631
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
messages like this you know iphone is

632
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,400
disabled try again in five minutes or

633
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
ten minutes or one hour or

634
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,600
a thousand years i don't know

635
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
that system is not really that much

636
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,120
applied to these systems as of

637
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,799
you know even today we also saw that

638
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,600
there was an

639
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,440
absolute complete lack of granularity of

640
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,000
access

641
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
either you give full access uh

642
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
apart from you know you the attacker or

643
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
the powerful attorney person

644
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,080
will not be able to uh give you more

645
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,960
debt but

646
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
they can do anything else so it's either

647
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,039
you give full access or there's no

648
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,000
access at all

649
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
and we said well seriously uh there

650
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
should be a more granular level here

651
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,120
like

652
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
you can pay my bills up to a certain

653
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,400
amount

654
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
or you can only transfer money within

655
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,720
norway you can't send them off to the

656
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,559
cayman islands or to

657
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,679
aruba or to the himalayas or anything

658
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,480
like that

659
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,799
but no there's nothing like that it's

660
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,000
full access or no

661
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
access at all i do know that the banks

662
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,240
are now working

663
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,080
on trying to look into what they can do

664
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
about this

665
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,520
but one of the things that i told the

666
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,960
bank is that while the norwegian

667
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,919
government

668
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,360
in norway has a portal where i can log

669
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
in

670
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
and see information about my you know

671
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,400
one person

672
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,960
company that i operate here in norway

673
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,600
and they

674
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
have many many many levels of

675
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,159
granularity where you have a lot of

676
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:42,720
different

677
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
roles that you can assign to different

678
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
people within your own company

679
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,039
organization or to other people to your

680
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,000
auditor to

681
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,559
your accountant and and so on and i send

682
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,960
the banks to the banks that well

683
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
shouldn't you be able to do something

684
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
similar as well to provide

685
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,360
grammar access for different people

686
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,120
whenever you want to grant powerful

687
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,159
attorney privileges

688
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,480
to somebody else to handle your

689
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,440
situation for you

690
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,880
and of course i did this in a

691
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,440
responsible or as i prefer to say

692
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
the disclosure away with the norwegian

693
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,559
bank dnb

694
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
we did this work last year in 2020 for a

695
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,559
couple of months

696
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
the majority of work was being done in

697
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
month of august

698
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
and we talked to the bank in in

699
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
september in 2020 and

700
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
continue to do so for several months

701
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,480
allowing them to look into and comment

702
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,120
on

703
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,520
verify and eventually also fix the

704
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,799
vulnerabilities that we

705
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,400
found and on march

706
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
1st this year 2021 um

707
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
i talked to the norwegian broadcasting

708
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,640
comparision nrk here in norway

709
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
and they did a story on this which was

710
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,640
put online on

711
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
march 1st and that was actually the same

712
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,080
day as i started working for the company

713
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,640
vips

714
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,039
who is the owner and developer of the

715
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,240
bank id

716
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
and dnb the biggest bank in norway is

717
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,039
also one of the biggest owners

718
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,159
of the company vips so i did talk to the

719
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,480
bank i did talk to my new employer

720
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,799
and they were fine with this information

721
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,159
going public

722
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,799
with the broadcasting corporation in

723
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
norway

724
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
and it said that you know i could hijack

725
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,799
a bank account just using a simple

726
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,360
one-page paper form

727
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,760
which again became more shocker to a lot

728
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,200
of people

729
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,760
but the funny thing is i got a lot of

730
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
questions a lot of feedback after this

731
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
and obviously people were shocked that

732
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,240
oh wow that's

733
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,120
way too easy anyone can basically fill

734
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
out this paper form with the information

735
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,840
that is

736
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
you know almost completely publicly

737
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
available send it in

738
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
and they will have access to your

739
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
account and you will not receive

740
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,080
information no notification at all that

741
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,679
they have gained access to your account

742
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,120
that that's

743
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,039
that's crazy but nobody asked me

744
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
why did you go to the media with this

745
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,960
story i mean you reported to the bank

746
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,559
they

747
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,760
fixed it or they are fixing it why would

748
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,159
you

749
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
break the story like this you know is it

750
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,400
just you know for the fame because you

751
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,120
don't

752
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,279
trust me there's no fortune at the end

753
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
of this you don't get rich you don't get

754
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,320
paid anything to do this

755
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
and it's an interesting question and i

756
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
will explain that because

757
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,360
i did this because we found that then

758
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:31,919
dmb

759
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,840
is not the only bank in norway that

760
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,240
provides this kind of paper form

761
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,600
but there are i don't know 100 200 banks

762
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,720
in norway

763
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,039
and i can't i just can't i do not have

764
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,799
the time or the interest

765
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,440
in checking all the banks because all do

766
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
it differently

767
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,039
and i didn't want to spend time trying

768
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,360
to check every single one

769
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,320
so we told the financial super authority

770
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,039
of norway we told the bank we told

771
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,279
several other banks and so on that you

772
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,640
need to check this

773
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
before we go public with this story

774
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,399
because when the story goes public

775
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
it will get easier to exploit this if

776
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
this is a solution that you provide you

777
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,720
know giving power of attorney by paper

778
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
and that's the simple explanation of

779
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,880
this of course additional takeaways on

780
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,520
this

781
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,159
you know the standard 90 days to fix

782
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,080
limitation from google whenever they

783
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,279
find some

784
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
serious security flaws and they have

785
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,880
also expanded this to

786
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,039
uh 30 additional days before any details

787
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,720
are released about

788
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
zero day export that they find in in any

789
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,399
products

790
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
uh it's a growing bug industry of bug

791
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,159
bounty programs

792
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,960
i'm gonna say i'm not really a fan of

793
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,600
big bounty programs i think that

794
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,720
the um you know it's

795
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,799
to me it's a little bit questionable uh

796
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,760
whether you know

797
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,799
our people participating in this to to

798
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,200
fix

799
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
problems or are they participating in

800
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,880
this to

801
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,360
make money uh i'm the kind of guy who

802
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,720
prefer to

803
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,039
fix problems and i also talk to the bank

804
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,880
of course and internally advice as well

805
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
about iso 29-147

806
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
about vulnerability disclosure and also

807
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
iso 3111

808
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
about vulnerability handling processes

809
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
if you haven't read these you should

810
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,159
uh it's interesting read it's a good

811
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,399
thing to try to see if your organization

812
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,320
is compliant or should be compliant with

813
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,159
these standards or at least

814
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,279
implement programs to work you know in

815
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,799
accordance with these standards for

816
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,279
vulnerability disclosure and

817
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,520
availability handling internally in your

818
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
own organization

819
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
in this case of course we found these

820
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
vulnerabilities with dnb

821
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
and it took six months before they said

822
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,080
that well

823
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,840
we think it we got it under control you

824
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,120
can now release

825
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
the new survey and there's still more

826
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
work to do on this

827
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,600
but again six months is a lot more than

828
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,640
google would have

829
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,919
sort of allowed if this was a zero day

830
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,440
in some online software

831
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,360
as an example and at lips we also have

832
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,159
our own

833
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,399
uh vulnerability disclosure policy

834
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,919
available at libs.now

835
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
security it's a version one and we're

836
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
also interested

837
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
of course in knowing what you think

838
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,399
about this policy

839
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,480
uh we do not provide any bug bounty

840
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,159
program at the moment but

841
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,039
if you should find something of interest

842
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,000
with us

843
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
please let me know and contact me

844
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,679
directly of course and

845
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,480
maybe i have a cup or a t-shirt for you

846
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,960
but

847
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,159
that's what we have today so

848
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,399
what's next then because we found this

849
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,919
and and now

850
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,600
you know the issue is supposed to be

851
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,159
handled and the problem is not there

852
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,360
well

853
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,559
dimby is so big of a bank that they

854
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,279
have to provide this powerful attorney

855
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,440
option on paper for people

856
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,279
again because there are some elderly

857
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,200
people some disabled people and

858
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,840
also a few paranoids that just don't

859
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,200
want to do this

860
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,760
online so they want to provide profit to

861
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,559
earn access by paper

862
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,480
and one of the things that the bank did

863
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
was to update the paper form so now it's

864
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,279
two pages and they require more

865
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,480
documentation

866
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,640
and one of the things that we've done or

867
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
are working on doing

868
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,320
is to use the new version of the paper

869
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,880
form to see if we can still gain access

870
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,080
even though we're not supposed to

871
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,720
and that's basically it from me about

872
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,080
this story for this time

873
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,399
and if there are any questions i'm open

874
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,519
for that

875
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,399
now thank you

876
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,799
uh okay so uh good to go

877
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,960
excellent so okay i'll get back again

878
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,440
too to to to decaf here

879
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,159
so uh my first question to decaf and

880
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:54,880
this

881
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
sorry decaf again it's kind of weird

882
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
that i'm asking you questions here but

883
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,159
i'm curious about this because again for

884
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,480
the

885
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,360
uh change notification you know if if

886
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,760
you

887
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,000
or on a hacker uh gives but you know

888
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
another person access to your account uh

889
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,159
yes there will be a notification to the

890
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,120
account or not

891
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,039
but how do they do that do they do they

892
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,120
don't do that online do they call you do

893
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,200
they send you a physical

894
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,080
uh letter uh do they uh send you a text

895
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,960
message

896
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
and so on because different

897
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,000
notifications

898
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,840
can have different security levels and

899
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,279
some of them can be

900
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,760
blocked or they won't make it in time

901
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,960
and so on

902
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
and the second is also of this no trice

903
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
signature because again a notarized

904
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,640
signature is

905
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,200
well i hear you you need to go to

906
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,240
somebody who

907
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,440
is allowed to do this stuff but can they

908
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,480
be bribed

909
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
uh can you fake their seal and their

910
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
name and signature

911
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,200
uh will those will those signatures and

912
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,960
so on ever be

913
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,080
um checked uh because

914
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,880
it's part of a sort of a physical world

915
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,960
and the issues that we found here was

916
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,039
part of a physical world using a paper

917
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,080
form

918
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,039
while the uh standard way to do is is to

919
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,919
do everything

920
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
digital using bank id which is identity

921
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,720
and authorization and you know at least

922
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,200
for the

923
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,720
background for this talk we could say

924
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,480
the bank id is

925
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,519
you know secure so that's sort of my

926
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,480
questions

927
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
so decaf it says it depends i've got

928
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
emails text and fiscal letters on

929
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,000
changes sometimes all of them won't

930
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,519
change okay that's interesting

931
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,960
uh you know i'm like you know i

932
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,399
i i can't i can't totally guarantee but

933
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,000
i can tell you i

934
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,039
swear my life i do want to go back to

935

938
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,720

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840

940
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,039
you know do all kinds of crazy stuff to

941
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,000
make it happen

942
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
and i hope to see lots of you people

943
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,399
there on decaf i'm going to buy you

944
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,200
a decaf coffee and i would like to talk

945
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
more to you

946
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,879
but are there any more questions looking

947
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,320
here in the channel now

948
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,679
so let's have a look sometimes all of

949
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
them for one change from decaf yes it's

950
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
probably possible to forge a notary

951
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
through bribing but it would be

952
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
traceable and random and prison likely

953
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,918
okay

954
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,159
yep that sounds good the the concept of

955
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,839
notary has you know it has at least

956
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,000
existed here in norway as well

957
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
if you are a student and you are going

958
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,359
to

959
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,879
you know well a long time ago when i

960
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,639
was no longer a student and i was going

961
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,719
to apply for jobs they would ask for

962
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,599
copies of my you know certifications and

963
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,560
degrees and

964
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,199
and and and so on from from school and

965
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,760
so on

966
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,839
and what i would have to do then i would

967
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,760
have to go to as an example a postal

968
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,560
office

969
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,800
and have somebody there make copies of

970
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,640
my original papers

971
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,160
and they would sign them and they would

972
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
stamp them and say that yes

973
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,760
we are sort of on notary it's the

974
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,040
official uh

975
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,359
postal mail of norway certifying that

976
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,240
these copies

977
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,960
are correct now of course you could

978
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,040
trick with that as well it wasn't really

979
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,160
that hard it's just paper copies but

980
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,960
today

981
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,160
um it's

982
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,760
you know i i don't know of cases more or

983
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
less where you

984
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
use this kind of concept anymore it's

985
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,720
it's it's digital

986
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,599
digital except in in this particular

987
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,280
case where we have witnesses

988
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
signing off and they are clueless on

989
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
what they actually sign on to

990
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,760
uh and very much up to a meet at some

991
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,520
point very interesting topic okay yeah

992
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,240
thank you

993
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,280
thanks decaf uh interesting

994
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,880
okay um is there anything more to say

995
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,079
um not sure and also

996
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,400
time is is of course running we still

997
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,320
have

998
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
well we still have 10 to 12 minutes i

999
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,599
think

1000
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,440
are there any cultural factors that make

1001
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,359
this example unique

1002
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,839
from nirvan

1003
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
a good question um

1004
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
when i've been doing passwords con i've

1005
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,040
done it norway in sweden i've done it in

1006
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,960
germany i've done in the uk and not in

1007
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,680
the us

1008
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,599
i've been doing talks in many other

1009
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
countries as well about passwords and so

1010
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,480
on

1011
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,040
and i've been getting increasingly more

1012
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,760
interesting

1013
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
in the should i say even psychological

1014
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,839
but that's these

1015
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,839
at least social and cultural differences

1016
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,520
that do exist

1017
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,520
um here in norway there is um

1018
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,200
there's sort of a saying not only in the

1019
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,720
security community but

1020
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,880
you know the norwegian population at

1021
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
large is that

1022
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,599
we tend to be naive we trust each other

1023
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,839
we trust the norwegian government we

1024
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,760
trust our prime minister we

1025
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,359
you know we even we even

1026
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,280
trust uh the tax authorities uh

1027
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,839
you know the government does our taxes

1028
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,960
for us

1029
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
and they tell us whether we have to pay

1030
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,160
additional taxes or

1031
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,200
if we get some money back and

1032
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
almost all norwegians they would just

1033
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
receive the results from the

1034
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
government's tax office

1035
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,240
and they will just sign off yep that's

1036
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,000
fine uh they don't even check the

1037
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,200
numbers

1038
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,320
and if that makes us incredibly naive i

1039
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,000
you would probably say that yes that

1040
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,680
makes us very naive

1041
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,118
um but we are

1042
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,839
you know we we are a country where we

1043
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,640
trust each other

1044
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,839
and that is a good thing for us but we

1045
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,079
are also aware of the fact that they can

1046
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,400
be abused which is something that we do

1047
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,640
see in some cases of cyber crime as an

1048
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
example

1049
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,280
and i do know from other countries where

1050
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
i've been that people they just looked

1051
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,240
at me and like you

1052
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
you norwegians you're you're freaking

1053
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,359
crazy you you i mean

1054
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,839
you got to be kidding me you trusted tax

1055
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,040
authorities

1056
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,880
and we do for this case

1057
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,800
uh it's a bit more interesting because

1058
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,839
i i did ask dmv and also other banks

1059
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,680
about these paper forms and they said

1060
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
that

1061
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,119
well yeah i i you know thank you for

1062
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,160
finding this and

1063
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,560
and um yeah it's you know

1064
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,040
we still have them because there are

1065
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,280
some people who

1066
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,640
needs them but we haven't really given

1067
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
it a second thought for

1068
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,960
years and years and years because it's

1069
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,560
it's now

1070
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,040
close to 20 years since we started using

1071
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,359
bank id here in norway and it's

1072
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,200
10 15 years ago since pretty much

1073
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
everyone used bank id

1074
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,920
so you know still doing stuff by paper

1075
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
form with banks is

1076
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,560
you know you don't do that in everyday

1077
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,800
life so it's it was basically like

1078
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,440
oh yes oh wow there's a paper form and

1079
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,520
you know we just completely forgot about

1080
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:07,920
that

1081
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,200
we haven't updated the technology

1082
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,240
in like a decade or more that was sort

1083
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,480
of

1084
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
the thing in this case

1085
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,000
yeah scoops i i can imagine you would

1086
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
love to

1087
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
have the us government do your taxes for

1088
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,320
you i can understand

1089
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
well not naive that's decaf just not

1090
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,079
beholden to those who make money of

1091
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,920
making us all fill out all taxes

1092
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
ourselves in the us

1093
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,280
good point good point uh i i have let

1094
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,359
the government do my taxes for for many

1095
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,400
years and

1096
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,440
i do check some of the key numbers i

1097
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,760
have well the the the few times i have

1098
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,920
found a difference it is so small that

1099
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,359
has nearly nothing to say on whether i

1100
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,320
have to pay

1101
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
additional taxes or i get any money back

1102
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
from the government because i

1103
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,640
paid too much taxes last year so it's uh

1104
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,319
you know

1105
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,319
i should say they do a very good job on

1106
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,160
this and again because

1107
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,040
everything is digital uh in these cases

1108
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,160
uh neon asks so this may sound like a

1109
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,680
silly question but does norway still

1110
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,440
have cash banks

1111
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,280
it's not a silly question and the honest

1112
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,760
answer is if you go to a bank in norway

1113
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,960
today

1114
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,040
they don't accept cash and they don't

1115
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,079
have any cash

1116
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,440
in the bank and they don't accept you

1117
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,920
even

1118
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,400
handing over cash and saying i want to

1119
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
put this into my bank account

1120
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,040
for most banks you can't do that anymore

1121
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,440
and and to the extent it's like you know

1122
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,880
well now we have the

1123
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,200
pandemic of course and kovi 19 is still

1124
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,960
a thing here in norway as well

1125
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,920
but at least to a small extent but if

1126
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,040
you go to

1127
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,960
any store in norway today and you want

1128
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,720
to pay by cash

1129
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,800
they will give you an eye and like

1130
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,960
seriously are you sure you don't have a

1131
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,200
card

1132
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,319
okay well then but because they are

1133
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,119
obliged

1134
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,160
to to take it uh it's still mandatory to

1135
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,480
to

1136
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,960
accept cash but most places they will

1137
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,720
really really really try to

1138
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,599
not do it and banks they don't have cash

1139
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,079
as i said

1140
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,400
so this is sometimes a problem in

1141
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,760
denmark with it's really difficult to

1142
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
find a fiscal bank that takes money well

1143
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,359
it's fine it's difficult to find a

1144
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,040
fiscal bank office that you actually

1145
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,839
allow to

1146
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,880
go visit because bank offices now are

1147
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,280
just

1148
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,000
administration officers it's not a bank

1149
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,880
where they

1150
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,680
handle customers in their office anymore

1151
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,560
and that's

1152
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,480
you know that even accelerated even more

1153
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,079
of course with the pandemic but even

1154
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,040
before then

1155
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
going to a bank office that's like why

1156
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
would i go to a bank office i don't

1157
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,920
you know what's what what would possibly

1158
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,599
be the point of doing that i

1159
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,200
i don't have to there's no need

1160
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,119
so dcaf how long has bank id been in

1161
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,280
common use uh and how long has

1162
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,040
norway been on digital focus banking

1163
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,760
system say 90 percent for five years

1164
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,440
bank id is i don't know

1165
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,839
uh close to 15 16 17 years old

1166
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,440
now maybe and i should know this because

1167
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,000
i work with

1168
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,640
bad guys because honestly i i don't know

1169
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,079
the exact date but it's

1170
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,640
it's been around for a long time and and

1171
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,839
today

1172
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,480
you know the the you can essentially say

1173
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,359
that everyone

1174
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,480
aged 18 and older are using bank id

1175
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
period i mean the percentage that's not

1176
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,520
using bank id

1177
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,640
is very very small

1178
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,200
and not only that but also some one of

1179
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,760
the

1180
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
things that and this is not unique to

1181
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,200
norway this is

1182
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,119
much more common to find in europe

1183
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,520
compared to in the us but

1184
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
in norway you know there's a there's

1185
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,440
sort of a clearing central between the

1186
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,000
banks

1187
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,240
so transferring money from one account

1188
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
in one bank to another account in

1189
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,960
another bank

1190
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,640
in norway is that easy and uh

1191
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,000
and you know a few years ago it would be

1192
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,680
overnight and it would be done

1193
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,000
electronically in all cases that's been

1194
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,560
the thing

1195
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,920
since the dawn of time as long as i can

1196
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,119
remember

1197
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,640
because we have this clearing central

1198
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
between the banks

1199
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,800
but the company that i work for now

1200
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
whips we have

1201
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,839
we have a payment solution name dips

1202
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,480
where

1203
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,200
the money is sent and received instantly

1204
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,839
within

1205
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,200
norway within anyone using dips

1206
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,280
and almost all adult norwegians again

1207
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,839
are using lips so if i want to send

1208
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,119
money to a friend of mine i would just

1209
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,839
use the lips app and two seconds later

1210
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:42,640
it says ping

1211
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,520
in my friend's phone and the friend my

1212
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,119
friend has the money in his account and

1213
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,079
can use them

1214
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,119
two seconds later so that and and that

1215
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,119
is available for everyone so it's pretty

1216
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,839
awesome in norway

1217
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,720

1221
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,960

1222
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,640
to pastorscom before

1223
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,680
kittens is a thing um

1224
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,240
and also puppies is the thing if you go

1225
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,599
to passwords condodoll

1226
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,760
you can read a little bit more about the

1227
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,079
use of kittens and puppies

1228
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,119
but it's basically uh sort of a

1229
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,040
symbol you use on on your first the

1230
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,119
second slide of your presentations

1231
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,160
where you say that this is the

1232
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,800
background information that we sort of

1233
