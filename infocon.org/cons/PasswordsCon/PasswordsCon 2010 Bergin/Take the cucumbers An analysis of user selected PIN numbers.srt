last

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,980
and then we look at what comes out

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,709
protectionist

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,530
and we try to produce advice

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,769
we have prickly

16
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:53,649
on two key products for possible eighty
over a case officer

17

any congress since it was

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,760
they lost last time i think something
like thirteen hundred products that goes

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,530
off

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,910
everyday

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,950
as we had welcome

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,290
i think we have such an aggressive
position right now i'm i should say

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,750
existence if you talk

facts ticketmaster

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,259
will be added to our own at some point
i'm sure

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,979
unsettled

29
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,910
we're going to today's complications dot

30
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,800
i'm for what we do the mighty

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,240
recheck the product we have a lot of
seeking various ways

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,089
the concentration of payments by
students to hold off

33
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,170
and then we try to produce invoice for
the rest

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,820
when nazi

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,270
israel not seems to me

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,130
anyway aren't rest easy depending on
customers

37
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,130
if we can

38
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,990
cuttings

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,298
listened raptly basshunter asking

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,450
i'm not so much please inside of it

41
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,210
but we're not so bad

42
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,210
excuse me

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,360
dredging co

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,689
we're not about trying to develop at its
worst aside as an officer offices on

45
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,559
proving that works for us

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,579
places at the farm

47
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,669
i thought we could fall back at it

48
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,339
this is what researchers is also a lot a
lot of things working

49
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:17,619
that makes these characteristics between
six and ten minutes in length

50
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:21,539
that you have chosen

51
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:24,328
and what it down and how do you think
waters

52
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:27,840
irish president means at least a person
put it out

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,989
walking

54
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,479
walked up and come back we'll take a
second copy doesn't matter because i

55
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,269
have ask questions about people can't
service for them

56
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,039
okay so they don't want a presentation
i'm going to you

57
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,388
destroyed a system we got we expect to
this particular case in very

58
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,779
broad terms

59
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,319
um... we didn't have a look at how much
taxes than you started hacking and

60
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,719
cracking

61
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,850
until we got a c

62
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,509
look at how do you want the choice to
dissect

63
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,268
certainly similar analysis on

64
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,799
infanticide

65
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,529
one visualized

66
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:03,339
and then we're going to try to generate
some advice that we might get to the

67
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,159
operators

68
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,989
an appointment comes on

69
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,049
and at this time

70
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,619
questions

71
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:16,889
subsystem characteristics worked on
several years ago

72
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,579
and assist in patient

73
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,450
i could talk about recently freely

74
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,369
if it wasn't use i wouldn't be here

75
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:30,010
i'm not going to provide any details at
all

76
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,358
we're looking at it

77
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,889
what we have a look at it or not this
was one of these in any way assuming

78
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,709
that works and what not

79
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:38,980
but it was you know

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,018
but are not an intended

81
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,919
and while they were doing things it's
fairly obvious

82
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,129
what the pins out but i want to make it
easy for striptease to just go inside

83
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:49,840
the point

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,349
presentation

85
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,369
one of the lapd

86
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,499
to do some work itself

87
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:59,228
no customers allman is presently

88
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:02,530
project that's absolutely wrong customer
relax

89
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,979
later what's up

90
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,139
harassed absence

91
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,679
okay this is the recordings for treason
it wasn't just a lot of spirit

92
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,569
the reason i ask you to change the
anybody's

93
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,449
bananas oranges because that's the
happpy displaces mannequins

94
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,499
avalos

95
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,080
so what if they catch what we got the
payments we got a complete set great

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,490
expense for weeks twelve thousand used

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,179
but you got a bit more left

98
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:32,399
usually takes place is contained in
e-mail address telephone number

99
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,580
now before we ones

100
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,889
person who was adequate

101
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,970
sanity check allstate will carry on

102
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,860
well email address is not reasonable we
didn't know that i can give us another

103
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,430
cartridges they just looks reasonable

104
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,409
the telephone numbers

105
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,020
using today someone uses expressions of
the system

106
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,008
under review by the

107
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:53,789
fistfights

108
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,430
once you have a very small number of

109
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,429
itself

110
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:59,409
so the system was insulting index

111
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,819
would be a guest on anything like that

112
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,029
morrison taking divert people's
unseating extensive

113
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,729
some frustration

114
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,758
and it was really

115
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,870
bogus number

116
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,930
using

117
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,639
and here is the frequency of the
telephone numbers

118
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,599
so you can see review people down here
if using an extension number

119
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:31,239
but the vast majority without of
simpson's submit infertile

120
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,128
some people

121
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,009
a far extreme and getting

122
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,900
moving to nashville and head

123
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,558
hearings

124
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,099
but they looked unbeatable

125
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,590
but here's what i think that

126
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,599
a telephone numbers all recently public

127
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,669
you still don't know it was an attack

128
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:49,919
bought the telephone number

129
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,639
as far as we see simpson's

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,320
just a little bit of

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,379
so that something happened

132
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,600
because of what did you get a look at

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,280
the effectiveness of various hacking and
cracking ten

134
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,068
because what we're trying to do excuse
me

135
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:11,229
has come up with a sensible assessment
of the race

136
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,330
therefore we need to know how effective

137
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,269
after you check printing techniques
mafia

138
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:18,339
i mean look at it

139
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,250
wonderful i think it is

140
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,880
look for judge lance

141
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,070
thanks for being used in the system

142
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,990
but sequences with him

143
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,389
captains constantly seek

144
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,729
architecture account

145
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,150
if we had a possible specialities main

146
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,739
which of course in our houses face the
pain is approximately related to the

147
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,699
telephone number of teams approximate

148
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,550
academies

149
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,259
rebound results

150
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,169
that's big news it is

151
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,378
aggressively you know

152
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,669
looking for work

153
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,240
i meet with members of our members
there's another number in the system of

154
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,320
missus and everything

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,800
my significant case

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,209
is clearly a grant

157
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,310
exceptionally

158
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,259
fragments of the time

159
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:11,319
means less than seven hundred contains

160
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,580
analysis techniques

161
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,929
went to cuba

162
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,008
but we did like to talk a lot of the
questions

163
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,449
wetlands apparently it's the same slides
talked on the peace itself

164
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:28,410
with some degree or

165
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,400
about five percent

166
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,210
faces its future

167
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,979
but he's letting anticipates apko

168
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,180
point seven percent point approximately
one percent that's any good enough for

a bit

275
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,240
uh... yet so it must be believed

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,470
actually april involves comparing
himself practically

277

but it's not surprising continues

278
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,329
because of course

279
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,200
there was nowhere near enough six

went ahead and use the moments

289
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,350
guess what gets the sense that uh...

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,620

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,660
wall that was your t_v_ release the exam
here

339
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,209
access to this

340
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,160
which is normalized ebit

341
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,030
so what about other things

342
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,850
okay so this is a dialogue

343
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,830
and this is the number of times it seems
a little zero

344
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,890
trips have been a muslim that for us

345
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,890
so it looks like we do not need lots of
businesses disposal

346
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,390
knuckles and i think that is not the
right thing to do it should be you know

347
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,380
when he was on a hike

348
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,460
the secrets here

349
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,530
charity concert

350
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,060
there is a bit of a power

351
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,579
so fast bikes

352
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,530
what about estimated to be and here we
have a graphic equalizer again

353
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,970
black reassessed

354
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,920
if it was his influential people

355
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,800
should have the same number of one's own
view

356
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,550
knowns

357
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,689
so that should be abstract one

358
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,919
we believe that the school hols things

359
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,829
do you expect a little bit

360
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,490
but certainly not

361
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,840
steven's mom

362
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,700
needs to be expert

363
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,420
and what we've done

364
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,720
this judgment yet account

365
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,160
over in my home

366
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,160
media continues to establish point has
been delayed

367
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,930
visualization techniques to seek whether
we can measure the admin

368
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,090
conventional weapons we might want

369
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,280
implants right

370
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,898
sonya on a second set of papers that
includes

371
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:25,149
the remoteness age temperament and seems
dismissive

372
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,080
rosin

373
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,800
against excellence about ten thousand

374
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
twelve thousand

375
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,620
we've got about ten

376
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,020
unique ones

377
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,590
okay so what it appears we've done is
we've not

378
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,659
so when you look at the ministry insists
on

379
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,060
look at it should be about the site

380
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,560
because what we've done

381
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,679
is harmful

382
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,250
unique games here

383
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,890
sodium

384
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,110
again but look basement i talked about
one hundred sometimes and

385
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,899
soviet that shows that

386
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,769
this is the only one of the vehicle

387
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:02,890
and shooting the signs of being victims
of a number of

388
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,179
she's missing drums on remarkably

389
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:09,080
soccer ball predawn some use

390
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,340
what that meant was moses that looked
like what you need the house and she's

391
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,550
not surprising

392
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,190
you know what we've done is not how much
of the business

393
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,669
virgins but two sets of eight

394
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,960
psychic it probably should be

395
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,640
and if we do this at this point

396
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,070
it needs to send sms

397
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,610
if there is definitely

398
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,250
bhabhi and that's what you'd expect to
happen

399
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,610
very much of this

400
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,750
went down in champaign

401
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,200
starting to be interesting

402
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,670
has started

403
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,150
seemingly

404
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,320
it we can see that happening

405
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,389
it looks like it

406
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,510
possibly to be not very much

407
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,799
on either side of secretary updates

408
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,210
rocks and bottles

409
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,190
incidents going on

410
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,929
thousand-dollar instances

411
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,630
seven thousand equals so we've made not
status

412
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,080
overlooked

413
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,169
well classes at expects its taste six

414
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,309

about

415
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,760
expects

416
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,279
those monsters inc

417
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,250
uske because very often

418
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,120
zombie season by identical

419
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,570
reviews one

420
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,700
when bill clinton slowest hold still
holds but its beginning

421
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,380
not not not

422
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,810
uh... but i still have the same home
hoosier

423
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,429
what we've done this ninety-three
politically challenged also

424
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,440
so that's just

425
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,149
much of that

426
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:56,179
i don't look at our graphic equalizer we
can see it's much more option

427
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,120
final goodbyes

428
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,060
on the east coast

429
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,510
i think he's bestsellers greenstone

430
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,700
increased eunji

431
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,120
but having said all along

432
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,699
regardless of some of the plight of
individuals

433
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,870
images lost

434
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,129
mon-wed

435
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,400
because if we actually had a real system

436
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,049
we got into senior management windows
broken picture

437
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,870
and if we're lucky to be my single
people

438
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,969
axiomatic ultimate decisions with eighty
percent of the exam

439
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,480
will help them make decisions

440
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,980
so we need to tell me what it means

441
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,920
so please come up with a little headline

442
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,820
when we come up with his life

443
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,830
all you need to know the sport

444
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,810
hasn't been s

445
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,940
absolutely

446
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,460
mhm against lesbians are now so i'm
sitting together

447
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,690
can't so we've got it looks management
firms do some reading because i think

448
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,110
you don't

449
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,668
it

450
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,010
nigeria is also the chorus

451
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,800
and said how do you want we can

452
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,870
has been the effectiveness of muslims

453
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,510
two experiments to signals design goals

454
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,610
important what we've only got one chance
to get

455
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,178
however we know about the user

456
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,750
ever been against the amendment

457
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,460
because that is absolutely

458
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,150
means one of our

459
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,470
if you get home

460
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,550
rechargeable

461
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,678
because the next time

462
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,740
this goes wrong to be a room

463
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,600
bumblebee oslo questions

464
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,129
and second we must make things worse
this very easy to come up with all sorts

465
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,150
of bombings needs that would actually
reduce the security

466
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,370
so we're not going to come up with

467
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,389
that involves storm clouds but he's
really great excitement adventure

468
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,930
really wanted to be into simple

469
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,460
disability or veteran cause im
opportunities cases and won't be

470
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,830
risk analysis of them are enormous value

471
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,720
behavior

472
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,420
rescue watson's was managed by

473
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,190
we've got some

474
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,039
accept the fact that whatever the state
of the system is now

475
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,470
it's going to take some time to be
placed mediation measures we have to

476
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,200
accept them into your system

477
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,560
children dot com

478
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,730
and so we're going to be

479
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,380
i can't imagine plan in place now we
want to start the system such as

480
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,850
such limited value that we are going to
work

481
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,820
who just bear in mind as it happens

482
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,050
what it was his friends goes throught
your monthly cost of this country was

483
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,180
founded off

484
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:46,130
everybody is a warning that one briefly
grumpy arson and ready to go see

485
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,320
pasal dangerous filtration isn't

486
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,770
what do we got the states and we called
the laptop

487
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,230
once we got there

488
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,140
and that means we have received thank
you again

489
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,200
okay so the bases most dissidents
asshole we worried about what's going to

490
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,890
tax bill that would

491
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,840
indicate something wrong parts of our
backup strategy

492
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,610
yet he's just inherited millions on but
somehow this densities

493
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,030
can be accessed

494
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,809
who watches them

495
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:19,030
other people and it really care about at
live pictures of that

496
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,899
so seriously

497
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,159
right it wouldn't have to be something
that he had

498
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,140
scripts that we're going to have to
release a choice for the pages

499
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,950
generate randomly into camp

500
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,850
union-tribune southwell

501
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,040
a massive involve significant change

502
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,420
and that's probably going to be out of
the said something big

503
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:42,240
but wanting to do that if you consider
that

504
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,260
another point bulk access

505
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,200
a case of all that is what i mean by
that i remember exactly just look at it

506
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,990
against you just want to get it

507
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,410
studies isn't it

508
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,340
psychedelic temperature

509
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,040
operation

510
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,510
it'll cost would want to unemployment

511
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,080
database so i'm going to discuss about
this

512
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,059
would use that as we would use a number

513
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,480
i'm going to be true

514
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,670
the story

515
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,560
well cabinet

516
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,240
season opens up

517
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,660
the bass in the region

518
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,770
and then we have

519
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,490
point here is to talk to tax cuts

520
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,730
and that's where

521
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,480
and attack result they specifically

522
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,520
obviously

523
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,690
applauding tools and techniques to be

524
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,900
you have to get sanctions policy on

525
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,760
if i on himself by spoken a lot

526
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,100
is a picture of him

527
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:41,169
uh... yesterday uh... well please

528
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,690
brijjsponsored

529
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,720
cycle axis was it won't work in this
place to be as much as possible

530
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,980
because people park

531
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,410
consist of attacks apologize possible

532
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,299
okay so this is

533
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,500
which i suppose that already
peacekeeping president up sequences

534
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,450
untuk

535
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,190
well yet

536
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,550
actually he was playing around

537
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,980
previously that's awful

538
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,320
simpson ever talked a bit too sonya

539
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,139
from that point difficult suggestions

540
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,990
so therefore we got

541
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,880
over discourse we probably should review
the jeep

542
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,790
use of the night

543
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,629
and see if we can cripple diffused
sunlight but i think

544
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,950
experimented with dates that we didn't
think

545
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,220
probably a bit of trouble

546
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
nevertheless allegedly

547
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,610
the very first

548
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,129
approximation

549
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,930
so much attention as they should be good
whose

550
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,730
interesting question

551
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,450
clear of the species

552
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,450
thanks doesn't have to be about

553
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,480
antipersonnel both days

554
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,220
but still

555
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,940
and that's not how many new options

556
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,800
last month native american

557
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,809
you might want to watch it seems right

558
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,490
exhibit number of guests

559
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,690
so maybe this is a case

560
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,290
where we actually should worry about

561
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,950
these registration for all the bandstand

562
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,990
we've got some hot button

563
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,460
i wouldn't want to take it

564
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,620
okay so we're going to come up with a
set of simple recommendations

565
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,419
expenditures tration

566
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:32,420
tools are probably going to do something

567
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,289
put it to the following peoples to shore

568
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:40,510
feel is prostitutes with

569
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,350
sequencer

570
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,679
attacks

571
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,400
contracts we should provide next week

572
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,020
more exchanged

573
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,779
if need be

574
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,370
but we certainly don't

575
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,669
capture p_o_i_

576
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,070
we don't want people santa

577
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,850
well presented over nothing

578
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,129
women choosing a pain

579
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,380
because that would be interesting

580
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,880
kindness

581
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,340
resuspended acceptable to the system

582
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:22,340
boldly wellesley dot k explorer

583
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
but we have expressed

584
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,919
tendencies

585
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,140
so that's the kind of recommendations

586
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,360
your purchases or adolescent easy thing
about this is at least the sky

587
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,350
that can be turned into the

588
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,699
design systems

589
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,110
because yet these are

590
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,070
standard

591
00:27:54,070 --> 00:28:01,070
valentine functions

592
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,210
packages that depends on what kind of
science

593
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,840
uses tended to use the same page

594
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,629
he wasn't beaches

595
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,200
opposes the cinnamon buns

596
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,070
sequences

597
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,760
but i don't like that

598
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,560
we have to decide

599
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,480
season for the working some ethical
considerations

600
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,549
no i i i

601
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,670
when it comes to him he is

602
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,720
backbase

603
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,040
engineering is

604
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,149
expected your wrote

605
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,240
parole

606
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,910
its quantity

607
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,970
it's probably not going to do

608
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:02,970
cuban things if you are university i
think i have to admit it

609
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,550
pressure if you are

610
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,600
this demands of journalism school

611
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,270
than you might want to go ahead when
watching

612
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,960
courses that's shorts how can i help you
someone's head over forty

613
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,440
senior management

614
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,440
it's very difficult

615
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,180
westnet

616
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,590
and then bbca back on the basis of

617
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,090
council implausible

618
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,220
animals that they've set those aside

619
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,159
quincy dot but he says you can't do
anything about it

620
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,630
because we will be found out

621
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,940
tend to choose

622
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,529
the solution

623
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:52,220
sdn

624
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,679
about delivery services that excludes
the chances are that we have been

625
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,570
talking to somebody else and i just
think this is a renewal

626
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,799
so i think we have to worry

627
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,100
how to connect to want to do this thing

628
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,570
and of course

629
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,500
wants to go to send you can't do much to
britain

630
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,809
it's really difficult to repeat now
celebrities to nothing

631
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:16,120
greenbacks

632
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,419
repeat the experiment

633
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,600
to see what happens

634
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,219
soprano

635
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,660
is gonna think he'd go next

636
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,580
for new york city police or whatever
company and start doing research about

637
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,439
where the bag

638
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,850
you wouldn't believe that just a heads
up

639
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,330
unifies them

640
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,050
can you imagine legal forum

641
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,460
it's not going to happen and then you
have to do that lol clinton-dole we all

642
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,650
have to disadvantaged committed like us

643
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,390
northwards

644
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:52,920
and so i wouldn't do that

645
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,160
tend to choose

646
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,450
so i believe has a piece of uh... work

647
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,800
but possibly her

648
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,110
i think about that for her

649
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,040
popular products my sons

650
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,530
would be something along the lines of
heavy missus president

651
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,389
do you have to get

652
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,870
in the same group before he took

653
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,799
chances on us

654
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,090
probably a small town

655
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,000
but i don't know what it is

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,309
uh... happened over time

657
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:25,700
commission to actually talking about
here

658
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,060
but i think that's a real challenge for
you

659
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,669
by simpson was arrested by the
distribution you've got so it looks like

660
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,350
next okay

661
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,010
projects like my final revisions

662
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,260
hasn't set given the choice of often
exists use the shortage

663
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,280
maybe with a little bit about twenty
percent people jesus and culture

664
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,680
but twenty five percent

665
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,280
telephone number and someone

666
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,510
fourteen percent

667
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,230
security position

668
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,790
isn't making when she's not number

669
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:07,790
bombast

670
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,020
it's too

671
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,100
that we have to look at

672

702
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,060
you have the same sort

00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,388
you need to look at it process

773
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:33,389
we do have products there

774

while i accept it is impossible

777
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:51,819
we consider the matter

778
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:54,139
we can set up i think what we did

779
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:59,409
thresholds

780
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:03,089

effects excellent legal threshold

783
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:16,669
we thought

784
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:19,089
because that doesn't

785
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:22,799

00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,999
might hit home with her

789
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,209
ones that we have

790
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:43,579
project so i think that's it

791
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,379
then the same

792
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:47,029
succeed in this car

793
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:50,479
do you need to protect

794
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:52,080
vaults because i don't have

795
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,279
witness who was will quite likely

796
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:59,409
but that's precisely what side but it
does not reveal

797
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,719
it has a seven twenty

798
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:05,789
decreased falsehoods

799
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:09,959
in memory it's not perfect a lot sons
alone

800
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,269
uh... but what we really want

801
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:14,198
i don't need to do

802
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,079
using words

803
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,759
to be able to tell them

804
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:23,959
access they type i wouldn't want to
homosexuals and say your boss doesn't

805
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,598
that's all i need to tell

806
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,689
i don't need to tell

807
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:32,759
i don't need that

808
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,849
to explain just going to happen

809
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,819
suddenly but you can't be helped

810
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:40,839
what i need to do

811
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:43,729
he's telling whether we hospital
administrators

812
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:50,609
crosswords

813
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:54,959

815
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:58,329
thank heavens

816
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:03,449
i think that's a lot

817
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:08,079
subpoena and that was a

818
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:15,079
and it makes sense

819
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:21,079
several questions

820
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,229
well

821
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:30,229
at

822
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,459
not just for

823
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:50,459
earth after charging

824
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:03,239
authority for profit

825
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:24,249
folder that's one thing

826
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:25,948
if this is a lot to q

827
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:30,479
recover password

828
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:35,569
any sort of audit

829
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:42,569
innovative

830
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,159
attitude

831
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:47,369
yet as my might anybody

832
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:50,379
uh... well i think i think that's
absolutely wrong or maybe our design

833
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:52,279
goal that we have to

834
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:53,879
lexus is three

835
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:54,730
yet anyway

836
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,709
and rehab

837
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,979
it takes time

838
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:04,549
yes takes time to get this project

839
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,440
led by that

840
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,509
you know that that's what i would
recommend

841
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,089
my part

842
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:19,089
