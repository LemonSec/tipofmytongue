1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,689
happy you in

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,040
mom

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,750
she you would

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,040
my man

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,890
mmm you yea

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,360
underbody this is Steve Thomas

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,340
with this place does West that

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,180
good are

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,239
so my

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,599
Hawkins about a 00 3

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,450
I'll watch so this what is

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,790
and the law starters out this is a a

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,739
instruction that is new to you and video
chief use

14
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:58,260
um what it is is a 32-bit

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,440
a 3 outran lookup table so

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,970
a basically

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,820
there's a an input all three inputs

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,949
up 32 bits an output a 32bits

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,369
and E that should table

20
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,500
so how it works

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,770
a so the in

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,149
the input that's all the possible values

23
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:30,680
for the three variables than

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,750
he output you can choose to be what
everyone

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,460
and this did changes

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,770
the way they lookup table works so for

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,390
this example a this is outfit select

28
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,750
so the first a call

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,470
a first column that is the bit thats
likes

30
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,490
which up the next to you operands

31
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,429
so if it's zero than its the

32
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,700
second operand so 0011

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,049
and if it's one than it's the third
operand

34
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,220
it's done it's I'll money 0.0 right

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,530
so you can pick it to whatever you want
arm

36
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,549
he I am really good at

37
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,900
MS Paint kato ISO

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,549
missus the same exact well

39
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:30,709
from or so should mention

40
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,250
but despite site %uh that the way this
would be encoded

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,420
is our AC if the

42
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,070
bottom up at a

43
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,819
pressure yeah I miss for the when you
give it to the

44
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,119
the instruction the law

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,769
3e what I you give it AC

46
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,109
for well your JC for the

47
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,200
the constant so

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,730
should so a the black lines

49
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,290
Rd first date

50
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,679
so 101 up you can think that

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,860
as the keep it look up table is

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,150
array thats so 101

53
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,760
would-be but that that

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,899
he

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,160
output than the red one the

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,540
up 00 which is that that's

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,019
to vote you grab the on

58
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,450
site so it's now 11 than the blue lines

59
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,109
a take third that from each

60
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,690
9 your he in

61
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,440
arm so after know how to say the search

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,380
by some missile I sell

63
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,700
exit I but

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,470
high school it

65
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,090
%uh so the faisal network for

66
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,470
does up it's just

67
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,010
16 rounds other others the initial

68
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,579
pre-mutation he final permutation and
then the faisal

69
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,149
action there about but and

70
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,190
X or the so

71
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,600
the initial a fermentation this

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,050
crazy hoopla I if you do this in
software

73
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,750
it's been really slow because you have
to

74
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,550
basically I A

75
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,419
do you Ubuntu ans to get the right
that's

76
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:44,310
that shift and or to the result

77
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,470
and takes a lot of work I V

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,240
final permutation is actually the exact
opposite

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,570
its go 0 all these are

80
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,969
going down it doesn't matter but I'd

81
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,090
just know that so each one of these

82
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,909
woo

83
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,970
circles is a bit 64

84
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,220
some he arm

85
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,800
the the schedule there's more
presentations EC-one

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,390
thats Jimmy choice on are

87
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,650
band rotates a which change depending on
which

88
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,770
subsidy you don't more %ah

89
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,080
Jan this is just like %uh

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,159
really hard to do in suffer when
hardware

91
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,330
you basically just connect wire ads

92
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,289
but that's where you need it so does is
actually made

93
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,540
so that it's really fast hardware

94
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,020
not this is yeah easy to

95
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,320
which gets applied each I'll Sukira

96
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,719
this is the function

97
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,260
a so you basically take

98
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,270
32-bit law venue

99
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,640
expanded to forty-eight the new axe or
the subkey

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,110
then it goes through he as toxins

101
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,210
and then a permutation so everything

102
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,430
up until now 0 well are

103
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,520
so clovis a the X

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,109
a session room

105
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,860
%uh your are it basically just

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,250
expands it copy some thats so its

107
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,030
agendas you know connecting morrow
inputs/outputs

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,690
0 requires and hardware but suffer

109
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,190
yes you a bunch of a and ships in ORS

110
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,780
you unit irritation great so

111
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,080
than so this this is the only part

112
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,190
thats up until now that

113
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,760
I you could literally just look at

114
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,240
one bit at a time and do it this part

115
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,560
hi basically I'm

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,750
mixes all them other

117
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,880
it needs to be. nonlinear function or

118
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,130
as far away from Norman years possible
risers

119
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,170
cryptography tax it's actually a a

120
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,570
does didn't actually wasn't far enough
away

121
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,409
from being mayor so there are some
problems

122
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,580
now 0

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,650
its lacing a that is out

124
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,870
so each one of the up leaving all
strength before the

125
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,220
thats arm you treat each one of those as

126
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,990
its own without ferryboat so when you're
doing your code

127
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,280
out you logically rename

128
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,419
ya variables so that up

129
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,930
the first one which mean guys

130
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,340
and they're actually be able to see this
mom like it get renamed 28

131
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,429
the that whatever so all that

132
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,840
is for free I'll when you separate
everything to you

133
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,539
that's I X or cost a little bit less

134
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,760
because home after the extension round

135
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,130
you done have 248 New Jersey

136
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,320
together Anders when dealing with

137
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,610
32-bit integers you'd actually split
that up

138
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,250
so then its you but this issue

139
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,599
only have to do forty-eight for every 32

140
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,740
rounds %uh so

141
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,450
when you are split each that into you

142
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,790
a very beloved its own um

143
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,560
you can be done your variables are all
32bits

144
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,290
so you have %uh 32-bit 32

145
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,819
iterations a does going at the same time

146
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,030
so the

147
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,550
only problem that this creates is the s
boxes

148
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,449
um one side you split a mall

149
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,330
out so each variable is he different
that

150
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,160
in the from from

151
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,319
over data %uh

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,390
you can then grab those

153
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,780
out than put that the lookup table thats

154
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,959
when I'm back out because doing that is
extremely expensive so

155
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,479
I'll want to be out

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,320
best ways known currently forearm

157
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,160
%uh just like dust standard

158
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,180
gates not and/or acts or

159
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,390
so these are all the different there's

160
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,810
ass boxes six that's input orbits output

161
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,189
and this is how many gates about

162
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,600
preach stocks I you can actually find
both

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,000
mission and the code for their I

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,480
marker I actually yeah was

165
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,890
a but a

166
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,120
than yasser she I

167
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,770
also did non-standard its

168
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,980
basically a

169
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,140
this lowered the number rose gates

170
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,500
her stocks from

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,520
average Joe 56 press box

172
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,130
to you 51

173
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,580
so a the first your first method that I
tried

174
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,600
just two see how like get it

175
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,010
was taking the non-standard gates

176
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,339
that he a

177
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,440
from the previous light all those than

178
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,459
not combine them so each one of those

179
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,839
were using light and an X or so

180
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,870
up basically I pot combining %uh

181
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,660
when three variables are used but

182
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,130
the output owes someone that is an
actual use later I can

183
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,250
actually just combined those inch you

184
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,450
1 %uh lookup table

185
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,990
operation so doing that reduced it

186
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,990
to you 36 recorder on average

187
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,090
so be the did counts

188
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,450
and ya

189
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,390
ice boxes your its on arm

190
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,110
so for a he

191
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,510
instruction hot basically there's

192
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,890
about so there's a a

193
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,210
E mothers a 256 different possibilities

194
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,230
the so there's two that we really don't
care about

195
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,320
up one that would just output zeros

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,980
regardless of what the input is so
basically it's dealing with no inputs so

197
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,420
opening all zeros are putting our ones
you really care about those

198
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,439
so we can throw those about I'll one
inputs

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,279
out

200
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,269
there's 6 a.m. sure this instruction

201
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:19,740
that we don't care about basically be

202
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,310
identity and not a

203
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,310
he different variables because arm

204
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,920
what since we have full control over the
lookup table

205
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,959
we can just logically not 10 the up

206
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,339
inputs without needing another

207
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,260
instruction so than four

208
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,709
to inputs the most

209
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,599
there's a 16 possible once minus the two

210
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,630
that don't matter and then minus for
that

211
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,339
are you know the identity and the not
identity

212
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,600
so me know a

213
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,220
so too in putting green put those are
actually useful up for

214
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,329
a he's Sparks's so

215
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,540
we have pic any to

216
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,550
a up the that variables

217
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,579
and we can do ten different operations

218
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,709
that work on both inputs

219
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,439
than if we use of three inputs %uh

220
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,110
there's 218 different

221
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,220
functions that we can do with all three
of those

222
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,870
the way the I made this simpler is

223
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,060
since I didn't do any the nodding arm

224
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,479
you know I got single variable not I we
can actually use you cannot not the

225
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,200
output so

226
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,329
up basically

227
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:59,390
a when you're running through this um we
can do

228
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,350
is eliminate half he space by

229
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,660
%uh if it's like

230
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,370
above certain point we can do is

231
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,560
store all the basically

232
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,849
not the output so that it's on the lower
half

233
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,949
so that when

234
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:26,920
you actually try to find um one word
like

235
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,769
doing well the next slide and a

236
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:37,330
mile so let the two basically you create
AR

237
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,480
okay for Corbett

238
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,520
I'll lookup tables so

239
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,689
basically arm when we're doing this

240
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,990
a

241
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,400
through

242
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,480
an email service blue year

243
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,640
her just so

244
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,000
basically arm we can get rid of anything

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,180
that is greater than

246
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,670
while us

247
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,410
32,000 its way for the orbit lookup
tables

248
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,880
because we can just not that

249
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,910
so that its on the Laura than

250
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,920
when we're actually trying to find the
correct one

251
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,990
%uh regis map it

252
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,470
to you the lower half from

253
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,010
actually as a.m. explains dark my

254
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:47,010
think okay yet

255
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,860
ok I'll have the trying to solve

256
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,280
is you have a whole bunch additional
gates available to you and now you

257
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,870
trying to find even more

258
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,240
optimal set love %uh gates given this
additional

259
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,360
gate space that you have and so you're
actually talking about saving space when

260
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,650
you're

261
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,150
or saving time when you doing the actual
logic reports incorrect

262
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,260
okay some volume of liver nasa sorry

263
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,880
so with that

264
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,520
%uh a basically cuts the search this

265
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,230
house since that

266
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,130
top that basically 0 nly not gonna same
thing goes

267
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,430
or the fight but look up table the two

268
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,589
side at work said I just did these for
like

269
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,190
job morrow I did the first one just as
like upper

270
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,740
car sup I just so that I could than

271
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,830
it stand it you even larger from

272
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,450
0 making out 5 table um

273
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,540
so with the 3 that selects

274
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,089
um so basically you're had shins

275
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,770
CF like for arm lookup tables

276
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,910
a than %uh yup to lecture thats

277
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,910
so you jus 10 that's to do

278
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,540
a its lack according to you what which
one it supposed to be

279
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,899
than %uh same thing for the other side
venues the other bit

280
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,230
to done that's what both is I'll and
then

281
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,320
I guess it's easier to understand when
you only have

282
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,919
5 basically same but that 0

283
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,200
you have a look up to than one but
that's one yet watch it table

284
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,679
and you its you

285
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,840
your so matted 3 those gonna try

286
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,870
but actually never got around you
finishing

287
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,399
from top a doing a

288
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,690
harsh or 6 that look up table basically
what you doing is

289
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,270
writing a a bunch of data that you

290
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,610
just that because not that this wouldn't

291
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,379
RAM a the problems is wat you think

292
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,100
up but you the basically saw

293
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,389
a few terabytes and then you have to go
back in like sorta and then

294
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,790
E put into a day usable up

295
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,940
usable data so that

296
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,650
than even work back from the %uh

297
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,920
basically beecher table for the 6 that

298
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,190
lookup table that

299
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,230
the a spot actually tried and

300
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,590
trying murders back birds %uh

301
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,899
an average

302
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,550
I have no idea what it is and

303
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,919
up best part is I don't have any of the
data from

304
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
yeah the method to you

305
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,190
because dancer home she's

306
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,180
so I yeah I i suck

307
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,610
a but

308
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,189
a it's actually not that hard right so
I'll probably do that

309
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,080
more Friday's something so

310
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,250
%uh if you are follow me on twitter or

311
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,600
get I'll probably put it there we should
on it

312
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,600
more hatch

313
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:36,520
if my computers on yes site so

314
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,690
up resources if you are so

315
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,610
feel like you want you you this I the

316
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,760
open or one %uh that actually explains

317
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,160
arm a

318
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,390
very somewhere method but I also want to
try this

319
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,610
from shins

320
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,340
US a

321
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,250
it describes like that out building a 5
that lookup tables man

322
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:12,810
are going back hurts rate great home

323
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,990
there that you

324
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:22,990
the standard and non-standard

325
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,219
that

326
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,220
your using russians 36

327
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,390
recorder that's alright no the

328
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,620
other 0 61 36 recorder

329
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,939
she's times a at that summit

330
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,350
medics the average but I'll

331
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,290
actually I that rate

332
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,790
air for me up

333
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,050
yes you so it I guess it I'm I was only
personally

334
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,480
for million with the La Plata 3 for
block 3 lot

335
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,790
lookup tables on so are the

336
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,300
all constant I'm SOL 256 possibilities

337
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,930
all take the exact same amount irv
instruction cycles um

338
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,010
and then also he comes across as a dick
compared to like standard X or is it

339
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,620
one cycle two cycles Amandine up the
implemented in hardware so

340
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,969
what we know about the actual
instruction itself um

341
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,810
I'm pretty sure a it runs the same speed

342
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,909
as all the other unite X or

343
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,570
and a good site

344
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,629
um in the programming

345
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,720
could %uh programming guide a there's
ace

346
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,960
it tells you how many

347
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,040
so with crew to there is some cooler
Corsair house

348
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,129
but reach core but

349
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,630
it's really weird arm like some the
newer ones

350
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,110
a they don't have as many imager

351
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,550
operation course so you know they say

352
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,690
00 hey each there's a 192

353
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,440
by there's only 6432

354
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,330
injure operations arm want

355
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,919
some the earlier ones a that you know

356
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,460
are had a breakfast now but those
actually had 10

357
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,010
a endanger operations and a
floating-point

358
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,830
operations you so her

359
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,810
classical so she's

360
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:47,810
in where

361
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,560
when thank you
