1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,049
whom thank you all for

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,899
school thank you all for coming to my
talk tonight posso it's gone

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:11,460
festival even though they're not here I
would like to thank

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,889
bourbon all the other organizes a poss
what's gone for a lower mean

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,299
me to talk about something that I'm
really passionate about and also

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,400
giving me the opportunity to present it
to a bunch of people

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,150
to experts in the field that lives in so

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,640
as you may have guessed I'm from
Australia my name is same Crowther

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,410
and this is a trooper firsts for me it's
the first time that I've left Australia

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,319
it's the first time that I've been to a
city with over 15,000 models have lights

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,239
and it's the first time that I've been
with such a large group of people who

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,199
share my passion for both passwords

13
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,849
and information security so just a bit
of background

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,489
my journey didn't just start with United
Airlines flight seven out of Sydney

15
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,820
it started four years ago when as a high
school student

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,440
the coding lightbulbs switched on two
years ago

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,190
I was engaged by Australia's defence
signals Directorate to work in

18
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,520
information security

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,089
this was the first time that they
engaged a high school student

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,720
I graduated from high school at the end
of last year

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,810
and opted to defer my university studies
in order to take a gap EM

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,640
while most Australians work out a gap
Ian as a year to holiday and travel

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,750
around the world

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,730
I'll 22 working information security
with the global consulting company

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,550
BAE Systems applied intelligence and a
global investment bank

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,970
now

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,730
I love cryptography this interests
popped my desire to make a difference in

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,650
the discipline of password security

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,280
and it helps me dress what I call the
password tweens

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,390
how do we make possible it's more secure

31
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,780
but how do we make the user experience
better

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,690
I've titled this presentation

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,550
the future of mobile authentication is
here in the next 30 minutes or so

34
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,500
I would like to discuss why I made this
program

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,830
describe how it works

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,900
demonstrators

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,520
and most importantly encourage questions
and discussions from you guys in the

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,160
audience

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,299
of hope the by the end of this
presentation that you too will feel

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,610
that this alternative to help a numeric
practices can mean poss with security

41
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,080
is significantly enhanced while said the
same time

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
making things easier for the use of
mobile devices

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,710
so

44
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,390
wanted to develop be sick well I
developed it at my frustration with

45
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,540
three things

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,179
firstly the amount of sites requiring
passwords

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,130
secondly the growing number

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,710
strong passwords that we have to have
and thirdly

49
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,610
the aggregating an aggravating challenge
of trying to remember love these

50
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,480
passwords

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,030
the more I talk with friends and family

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,020
the more I experienced it wasn't just me
getting irritated by passwords

53
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,650
and that's when I knew I could and
should try to make a difference

54
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,180
to help validate my feelings

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,380
I surveyed almost 1,000 people and asked
them about their experiences

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,480
attitudes and preferences towards
possible its and by the way I have

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,500
the results in the senate here if you're
interested have a look

58
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,540
nap the most uses

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,000
are where the purpose a possible its as
well as the importance of the secure

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,319
the its security of personal information

61
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,250
but they take risks with both the
content and the storage passwords

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,220
and this is because there's just a
growing number of passwords that we need

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,430
as well as increased I'm resetting

64
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,120
those strong passwords which women to
remember and frustration with the

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,030
inconsistencies a different password
systems

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,450
and requests to change them

67
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,608
did you know that most users are
actually worried about the password

68
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,380
security because the written down

69
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,639
so many different places

70
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,210
most users will also stop using the
Website

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,500
if they get too frustrated with the
password system

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,760
some other interesting take outs from
this research

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,340
include ninety-four percent of people
axis 126 poss were protected web site's

74
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,530
weekly

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,799
seventy percent abuses use the same
password across multiple web sites

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,820
more than fifty percent will change
their password

77
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,490
only slightly when requested

78
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,930
less than 20 percent feel positive about
this change

79
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,380
and 67 percent of people believe the
passwords are reducing the quality of

80
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,199
digital life

81
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,630
mobile devices a focus in the pains and
problems the passwords

82
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,020
and without any intervention what with
without intervention

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,948
like you see the pain and problems will
only continue to grow

84
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,320
researchers from Microsoft and cult in
university

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,990
released a paper on password portfolios
last month

86
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,710
they pretty much hit the nail on the
head when they said the human

87
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,900
impossibility overusing strong passwords
consistently

88
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,469
in a paper presented to the MIT Sloan
School of Management 2012

89
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,970
research il tak Bain said

90
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,889
we have seen a significant shift from
the PC & laptop

91
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,650
to mobile devices such as smartphones
and PCs

92
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,780
bays observations were echoed by Carolee
nominal SE

93
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,770
research vice president Gartner when she
said

94
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,359
as consumers shift the time away from
the PC

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,280
two tablets and smartphones they will no
longer see that PC

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,030
as a device they need to replace on a
regular basis

97
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,619
by some all these researchers quotes up
into one thing

98
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,760
mobile is the key to add digital lives

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,930
now that you've seen the background on
why I credit you see

100
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,440
I would like to explain how it works

101
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,790
you see takes advantage serve one of the
greatest sources have entropy

102
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,650
photographs so what to do with
photographs

103
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,429
well you seek analyzes the dot up behind
a photograph

104
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,810
and Lincoln cat makes these pieces have
dotted with randomly generated keys

105
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,389
the skis and then hashed with the shop
03/05/12 catch at hash

106
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:01,699
and put into one stream to form the news
as password

107
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,030
now looking around the room I know that
most if you guys will be interested in

108
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,049
the mass behind

109
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,590
so here it is let's take a four digit
PIN

110
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,789
there tend to the fourth possible
combinations a four digit PIN

111
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,199
and for a regular right character
password on a 95 character keyboard

112
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,680
this team to the 16 possible
combinations

113
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,190
but when we look at the UC key this team
to the

114
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,590
460 third pal possible combinations

115
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,409
for the key that is generated with the
c:\program

116
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,620
respected security practitioners in
industry

117
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,780
government in universities in Australia
have favorably critique the security of

118
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,590
this program

119
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,960
one even describe one even described in
the white

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,919
that the universe will end before
hackers are able to brute force this key

121
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,780
with today's current technologies

122
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,229
to back all this up I put the details up
the Ecke

123
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,419
into McAfee owned open researchers brute
force calculator

124
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,659
and hear the results on by the way this
is the specs of the world's fastest

125
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,860
supercomputer

126
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,740
exhausting its it's a big number of
cases per second

127
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,810
and unique infinity years

128
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,120
who so what I'd like to do is just give
you

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,960
the background and show you the program

130
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,960
group in them

131
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,610
so the apples currently in development

132
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,229
buddy is saloon clinton

133
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,360
shift but we're up

134
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,720
okay so willz just to give you an idea
of what this program looks and feels

135
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,730
like a thought to give you a quick
demonstration

136
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,620
so here we are at a registration screen
now the app already knows my name

137
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,300
because I've previously registered

138
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,790
but we'll put to use in a min here and
then we would press this

139
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,370
select your image button and then we
would check the photograph in a camera

140
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,860
roll

141
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,959
so now we've registered to the sick
application

142
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,748
will look out and we'll look back in
again as a returning user

143
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,879
sis the process is very simple we press
this button

144
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,910
and we select that photo once again and
that's how to authenticate sus

145
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,759
now this key generated is

146
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,660
changed every time so it's very similar
to a one-time password however

147
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,050
it can be who they can be a static
password as well

148
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:43,050
and me softer seen that in showing you
guys

149
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,699
the program I'd really like to discuss
with you guys because you're the expert

150
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:52,429
some in the 8a no I don't know
everything so I really

151
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:56,319
like to get your opinions and any
feedback that you may have

152
00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:01,979
so there any any questions there

153
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,709
criticism were

154
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,128
know so the ideal would be

155
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:16,339
you have this log in with Facebook or
log in with Google button on some web

156
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:16,939
sites

157
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:21,219
you would press a login with you seek
button it would then take you over to

158
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,189
the UC gap

159
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:26,529
which would generate your key and then
sent back to the server which have a

160
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,809
piece of code in a database on their
side

161
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,889
which would then compared compare that
hash

162
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:38,110
with their databases entries them

163
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,990
I'm back whom hit

164
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,009
use is world there

165
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,350
where the so who is in the photograph

166
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,439
yeah was or where

167
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:58,199
yes so these photographs are coming from
photos that the user has taken

168
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:03,389
and this is because there as with humans
would naturally visual beings and we

169
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:05,089
like to see things so we can

170
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,170
remember photograph much better than we
can remember you note 12 character

171
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,429
password age

172
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:16,620
so me

173
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,610
days is like

174
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,439
number both my old

175
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:29,279
the him

176
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,620
I'm

177
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,420
concerns about people both

178
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,559
here here so

179
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,429
ruled this is locked down each photos
look down to the device

180
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:50,019
in the way that the program processes
the photograph in generates that hash

181
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,230
as well so if they could use a fighter
that other people have another devices

182
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,170
but the camera

183
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,679
and that photograph will be restricted
to that device and as well as any fish

184
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,420
suggests 02 it'll be right limited two
maybe three attempts and then rule book

185
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,839
after five minutes or

186
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,929
did the usual sort of stuff but as well
as that if you have

187
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,410
below a certain threshold of photographs
or feel that you want an additional

188
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,629
factor was in this is

189
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,179
you wouldn't use this on your own you
want to combine this with an additional

190
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:17,910
factor

191
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,769
you could opt to have a two or four
digit PIN as well as the photograph

192
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:25,620
when our

193
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,970
old on were all

194
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,179
/url

195
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,420
him

196
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,299
nice on the phone I never leaves the
device what would happen if you want

197
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,649
if you want it site at the moment it's
just for mobile devices so if you want

198
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:47,759
it on your tablet

199
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,819
and your smartphone you could email but
you have to

200
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,809
authenticate that stab lit if you'd
already registered on your fav phone

201
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,660
smartphone to access your account and
then

202
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,429
im yep or you could work with Apple's I
cleared the sink them automatically

203
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:11,569
or you could choose another photograph
if that's what you want cooker

204
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:18,569
old hard

205
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:27,110
so at the moment yes you would but if
you

206
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,709
had one device that you want to cheese
for banking than you would on the idea

207
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,399
the register that device

208
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,399
the banking website with you see goldman
et cetera like them

209
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,639
inured

210
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,799
so the picture is sort of like

211
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,529
the something you know combined with
something you have part of the

212
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,049
authentication

213
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,649
and then so instead of entering the
password you

214
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,179
you put you select the picture so that's
what that process is trying to replace

215
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:13,179
used

216
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,839
yet you need to it because of the way
the arm hashes generated

217
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,809
you need to select the photo every time
when

218
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:33,160
here so it looks it fingerprints the
device

219
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,139
as well as lookin at segments old
daughter in the photograph from the head

220
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:38,549
is

221
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,649
as well as bits of information that a
throughout the body

222
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,519
the photograph and then puts them
together with bits of information the

223
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,389
change like the current time

224
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,319
as well as unix timestamp in

225
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:55,659
which is how the one-time password parts
generated your

226
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:00,419
no it's not objective like recognition
technology looks at just the binary data

227
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,399
behind it

228
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,350
them

229
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,350
in the MOU

230
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,460
developer who have been national nothing

231
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,630
this is all it's designed to plug and
play for developers essentially

232
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,120
well the and

233
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,760
used

234
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,410
again so if you miss taking the yet send
it out the council look down to certain

235
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,280
devices

236
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,699
and thus that device will only allow
those certain photos

237
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,580
to be so if if for example you share on
social media

238
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,970
and some 10 alt delete it sorry

239
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,580
place at Lake if you accidentally
deleted that's when

240
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,980
process similar to that of a possible it
reset would take place

241
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,980
be world

242
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,510
its most if it happens client-side
that's what most in the processing is

243
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,960
server-side it's just a regular
comparison to the hash

244
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,600
to have stored in the database used

245
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,820
not yet the apt still being developed
but it will be released soon and then

246
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,190
when it is I can send out to her to
distribute a link

247
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:23,190
wired

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,350
certainly both depending on what the
Klein eight so if there's someone is

249
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,260
sensitive about security like a bank

250
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,800
then it will be local however if it was
someone who is not so sensitive that it

251
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,300
will be no wealth look on

252
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,180
gold

253
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:48,180
bpm

254
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,050
yeah I'm

255
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,109
so the server has pieces have dot up

256
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,320
up from not actual peace a dollar from
the photo but has two faces a donde

257
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,780
which it will then generate a one-time
password if it sees in the one-time

258
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,609
password system

259
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,389
on its end and compare them to make sure
that it's a valid one time password

260
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,540
them

261
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,960
moved many more we can

262
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:27,450
boepd line that's a really good question
I'll

263
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,970
we'll have a chat about it later I
that's a good question so

264
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,720
gotta running out of time so will draw
to a close but

265
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,870
I'll be here for the rest I B Sides for
some

266
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,780
blackhat and DEFCON so if anyone wants
to come and have a chat for free I'd

267
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,610
love to talk

268
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,120
after listening to this presentation I
hope you

269
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,429
gots 3 messages at this the mobile as
the k2 at Digital ons

270
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,560
that you seek is a working solution to
the pains and problems the passwords

271
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,960
and that you sing offers high levels of
security and a much better user

272
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,920
experience

273
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,920
he thanks on where
