1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,909
and II don't touch anything should be

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:07,930
in

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,340
yes are about

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,080
educa- stay 'cause I got in

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,180
this Mike level get okay

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,670
I can do it attica

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,570
passwords gone 2014 what's going on

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,890
K a my names Nate power

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,649
pen tester researcher working on the to
the security team over at CDW

10
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,800
I just got a quick show of hands to make
sure you guys are great presentation

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,349
does everybody know what note anyway

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,050
yes okay hot we have any pen testers out
there

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,980
got a few we have any inspiring as yours
out there

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,410
raichel of you don't know what no W A as
it's actually Microsoft Outlet Le about

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,108
a it's basically a remote service that
allows users the

16
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,189
the only get email through a web
interface and OWA actually

17
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,360
is service that runs on a Client Access
server along several other services

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,100
well I had pretty much done a black box
app review

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,610
some the services on the Client Access
server and found several blogs and

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,150
system I've been able to leverage these
bugs during hand touched

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,590
a that pretty much give me information
about Exchange environment and its users

22
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,020
yes

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,100
head lights light

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,479
ankle

25
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,539
something's really talking about today

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,030
I'm be talkin the hot actually
discovered his client access servers on

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,680
the Internet

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,610
that Mexican take it a step further talk
about hot actually discover the internal

29
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,479
IP addresses

30
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,899
climaxes servers I had actually
discovered a

31
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,799
method to be able to validate users to
any form of medication

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,310
I found several issues an autodiscover
service that will be able to leverage in

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,140
penthouse

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,160
them all talk about some things that you
guys nexidia to reduce the risk in your

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,770
fireman's okay so for discovery

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,819
typically when I started pentasa always
perform

37
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,480
DNS per foreseen just to try to discover
what my customers

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,690
a what servers serves as you might have
about their

39
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,690
on the Internet and gone through several
the is I'd always notice that there's

40
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,010
this

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,209
I discover got whatever that dot com is

42
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,599
that customer and most my results
actually digging into what I did

43
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,209
discover service does

44
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,989
I had found that the service is used for
remote

45
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,599
outlook lines to be able to discover
Client Access server

46
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,429
and then automatically they'll be
configured and users elocon

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,670
steps that the I

48
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,049
Allah clients actually doing to discover
the Client Access server what's actually

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,819
going to be

50
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,958
is to static URL pass minutes do not the
in a service

51
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,390
record lookup so I had actually taken

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,599
a sample size a $500 random
organizations

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,069
I and II taking some common pen tester
methods for discovery

54
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,280
along with the set at your house in the
DNS service records I found

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,989
a little bit over half a bell a

56
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,049
organizations in my sample set I was
able to discover their mail systems on

57
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:27,739
the Internet

58
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,819
I found the static URL to be the most
common method for discovery

59
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,000
then of course DNS reports came in
second

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,319
so this is actually a pretty valid way
for discovery

61
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,079
this is the first book I found a

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
in the OWA there was actually against a
AA

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,870
I 2010 Forefront TMG setup

64
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,430
I was going through it actually
attempting to just see if

65
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,980
ASP dotnet the blog was enabled on any
the file path I get access

66
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,450
and I had actually found on the overall

67
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,018
filepath at give me a little bit
different have error message that i've

68
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,620
seen on other file past

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,760
to wear if you see down there the
highlighted the

70
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,790
use our house address is actually get me
the internal IP address other

71
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,849
reverse proxy processing request for the
OWA

72
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,990
this isn't specific to a forefront proxy
I have seen and third-party proxies

73
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,990
but it's always been a reverse proxy
next issue I actually found was an

74
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,419
I asked that runs on Client Access
server tissue actually goes all the way

75
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,669
back to OWA 2003

76
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:42,940
I am I essentially found that when he
said that gingrich

77
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,400
request a very specific file past you
leave the hosts had her Auntie

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,448
Anderson an HTTP 1.0 hers is a 1.1

79
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,009
protocol requires that it reveals other
internal IP address at the Client Access

80
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,180
server

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,180
and 302 location headers in the 4-1
basic wrong hatter's

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,289
these are all the wonderful file past
that I found there are some sample

83
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,469
several other more out there that I have
included into the Metasploit module

84
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,280
and I know you guys are probably
thinking all what's the big deal it's

85
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,299
probably

86
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,449
it's just an internal IP address what's
that matter to me

87
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,590
all the way I'm actually leveraging that
on account asked is

88
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,320
once I actually get internal access
whether i plug into the network name its

89
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,500
wireless or even get on the VPN

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,199
this is actually Tom the subnetwork
potentially most servers are sensitive

91
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,150
information are

92
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,258
sitting

93
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,889
K and she has a demo here

94
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,910
I can figures a slight

95
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,530
the

96
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,299
I cacti I'd here to see that a

97
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,830
you come in time got deposit your like I
want to show you guys how quick

98
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,630
discovery matters

99
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,469
I had a record on shell script that
basically goes through looking for this

100
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,800
other discover

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,190
service out on the Internet I had
included the

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,949
steps at the Alachua a dozen I to
include some common methods here

103
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:23,030
any CIA it was a bit December I'll the
domain name for an organization

104
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,330
and this case is example dot com and
within a matter of seconds as a blank

105
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,990
line answer

106
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,440
okay the

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,490
here I'm actually pulling the internal
IP addressable Client Access server

108
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,440
issues in the open SSL client

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,020
and this first example here for the
hosts had a plan and whatever hostname I

110
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,370
wanted

111
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,900
and you could see there that actually is
revealed in the basic ground there

112
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,969
and doing open houses I'll commanders
that quick SMS gateway to do this

113
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,210
function you guys and then you can see
if you leave al

114
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,568
the hose hanger here

115
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:14,050
the internal IP address is revealed

116
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:21,050
pretty cool okay

117
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,790
alright so I

118
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,650
Lee able I found a method to be able to
invalidate users

119
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,109
three-time an attack essentially what
I'm doing here I'm a

120
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,610
time in authentication request to the
Client Access server

121
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,830
and I've been able to determine if that
count actually exists an Active

122
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,450
Directory

123
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:47,070
this is all the code I'm using:

124
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,200
to be able to accomplish this attack a

125
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,210
I was working a tent SK as I I was
attempting a brute force in OWA 2010

126
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,299
%uh system that's actually birch force
in the WS have

127
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,340
and it seems like all just eyeball on
all my

128
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,650
authentication requires when I was
attended per sources say Nor Cal

129
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,010
was taking about sixty Seconds to come
back I had nineteen thousand user names

130
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,140
as attempting the gas

131
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,010
at the system and a limited amount of
time on the antacids just take any way

132
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,710
too long

133
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,570
so I want to figure out down to the
second how long is this actually gonna

134
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,490
take me to go through all nineteen
thousand users and last

135
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,350
well evaluating summertime response is
actually start to see patterns

136
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,290
time responses where allotment actually
validate users

137
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,640
and I at determined that since this was
mainly being done because I want as

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
current on the back end

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,669
the menu send authentication request

140
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,900
by Naxos survey climaxes serve actually
handles that does the

141
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,980
a communications at the domain
controller

142
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,010
the and the real issue here is actually
help when his caresses staging

143
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,630
authentication required us

144
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,470
a on the dimming controller versus going
to come in to see

145
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,860
the main actually it's us enough the
main and says it's going to come back

146
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,820
and see if the users in the database and
then of course abusers in the database

147
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,910
is going to verify to see

148
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:15,730
passwords these are my test results

149
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,300
iight found on non-existent remains
response times for those are coming back

150
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,939
between two and three seconds

151
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,590
the things that exist but the user name
doesn't exist

152
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,860
on response times actually very between
systems

153
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,040
but the pattern always existed in the
system

154
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,810
I was a evaluating and then of course at
the domain and the user name exists

155
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,329
most the time actually find his response
times to come back underneath sector

156
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,250
and keep in mind some this is gonna vary
depending on system resources

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,760
so above the system's your pen testing
a.m.

158
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,760
network speeds get him play a factor
doing it

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm an analysis on non-existent remains
but you can see here in the middle calms

160
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,770
the

161
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,030
user name was that I'm using an attempt
in a ver force on the very first request

162
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,240
time came back and 2.2 bisects

163
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,040
every class after that actually came
back underneath the second but continued

164
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,589
to let it run it seems like every 30
seconds

165
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,000
you see the 2.25 second request again
and then to be

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,720
30 seconds ago so there is a pattern
doing a timing analysis we actually know

167
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,470
the demesne

168
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,540
using the same username list in the

169
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,579
no column there for in this case

170
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,960
for account that then exists response
times to come back in fifteen seconds

171
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,290
and you can see administrator gas and
training Ralph ballot counts in the

172
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,430
systems and those response times came
back on me

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:51,839
sec these are all

174
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,260
herbal past I found on the Client Access
server form-based authentication

175
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,500
basically from 2007 2013's wonderful

176
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,720
even if you run it running it through
Forefront TMG setup

177
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,540
I had found style static I asked file
past

178
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,969
that's a poorer HTTP over in CL

179
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,170
are vulnerable the to pass tonight
listed here

180
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,579
are have HTTP over and chillin enabled
by the fall

181
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,770
I can surrender demo here

182
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,110
acting can take you guys torsten aerial
out how I started pentasa

183
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,640
the other test up time in attack ads
tests and the office before from there

184
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,640
a good so here you can see at the very
top is my username was amusing

185
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,939
on purpose I'm putting in their account
that I know for sure

186
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,300
but they haven't set up an Active
Directory and then I put

187
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,069
some deep all accounts a are in Active
Directory when you install it

188
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,320
administrator and gas I'd modified the
hour-long ember

189
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,680
a a login script to Metasploit with the
timing attack it hasn't been submitted

190
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,750
yet but it is available on interest on
that log

191
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:12,750
so you can see here in the middle column

192
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,380
or the actual times account the nineties
us him back in 15 seconds

193
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,290
administrator came back underneath the
second man we have a guest account back

194
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,060
in our second so we know for sure the
time attack works against the summer

195
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,810
actually going against the form they saw
okay

196
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,500
now that we know the timing tags: s I'm
gonna go through

197
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,310
and a use a user name was a common
accounts that I know it's

198
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,500
us is usually people set up Comcast they
don't fit strong passwords around on

199
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,160
attempting to guess a password to
password one on these accounts on one

200
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,020
now which accounts for actually Ballard

201
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,630
its bank games actually build a less a
felony counts I know exist in the system

202
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:02,170
as caspian this up for you guys it's

203
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,599
this process is actually multi-protocol
and other time responses come back the

204
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,150
same

205
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,270
this is more about personal concert

206
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,949
okay so you can see here we actually
have an SQL service

207
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,400
hell I came back under second man to
train and how they came back underneath

208
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,220
the second

209
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,550
we got lucky as shit and got a
successful logging on now on

210
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,189
they probably think it was the point to
move beyond this point got a successful

211
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,770
login

212
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,910
just log into the OWA pull down the
Global Address Book and came over right

213
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,910
Jack alt

214
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,029
login with the train came we're not
finding that this account is a standard

215
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:51,100
demand accounted doesn't have any
exchange permissions or a mailbox so

216
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,529
what can we do that with the at that
point ago

217
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:03,529
well

218
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,760
I found some pretty cool she's not as
cover service

219
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,230
I thought you can actually authenticated
the server

220
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,390
search service that you don't have any
exchange for missions but I also found

221
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,680
an XML SOAP reverend jackson

222
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,520
where it actually allows me to inject an
email address so I can pull

223
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,230
I did discover comtex other users in the
exchange buyer

224
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,540
but looking for the config files is
quite a bit allude in there that we can

225
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,279
actually is on the Pentecost

226
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,170
I'll go ahead and step through the
here's the actual

227
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,689
POST request that gets sent the
autodiscover service

228
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,850
your Outlook clients census requires the
email address parameters actually

229
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,610
bondable

230
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,890
and if you per a valid email address

231
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,199
and this parameter you're able to pull
the configuration file for any is an

232
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,950
exchange

233
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,950
looking inside autodiscover convict we
find things such as full names

234
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,339
which is kinda cute name to use and
social engineering

235
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,560
we actually have exchange permissions
which is pretty interesting because

236
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,489
anybody that set up an exchange

237
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,160
that automatically added today Exchange
Administrator group and I would consider

238
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,779
Exchange Administrator more of a
container and there's actual objects

239
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:22,050
inside a container that heard it ring up
for

240
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,779
permissions I'll be fine. user names

241
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,980
and the autodiscover can say if you've
ever migrated

242
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,510
your exchange and if your company has
been around for a while I'm sure you

243
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,829
have at some point a

244
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,920
the legacy DNA information from actually
gets stored in the autodiscover

245
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,149
we find some more discoveries such as
things as domain controllers

246
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:49,310
the which is pretty interesting cuz

247
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,489
going through X an M rating multiple
complex

248
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,860
files you find things like not ever user

249
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,970
I think case in the same dimming
controller I am

250
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,970
or even gone back to the exchange for
missions I I found Exchange

251
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,850
administrators that screw up

252
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,690
the permission so that works actually
able to identify system administrators

253
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,670
I am and then they can take part is the
things like service

254
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,750
at your alls what that user has
permission acts

255
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:22,750
okay I at gretna on

256
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,959
ruby script here that actually does the
XML SOAP in Jax am

257
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,689
at the very top here I have a lot less
than the email

258
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,029
maybe I strip them off again or maybe I
just cast doubt on

259
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,660
doesn't matter cuz we just aroma
services see what comes back

260
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,829
I'm actually using the training account
password one

261
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,699
has no Exchange Commission's extracted
all the complete files

262
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,370
you keep in mind this is also about that
for validation

263
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,140
see if councils this is the raw up to

264
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,569
a discover third there you can see we
had all

265
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,730
discovered user names and username
formats

266
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,699
having a number a is pretty important

267
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,290
because now what I can do is actually
generate my own worst a potential

268
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,149
a numbers go back using the time intact
try to determine which ones are actually

269
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,660
Bella

270
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,189
the and there you can't see just for
flair we pulled out that the bank

271
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,839
trawlers

272
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,060
okay so the top

273
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,760
appears actually it was have a numbers
that I generated now I'm going back to

274
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,330
the timing attack trying to determine
which ones are valid

275
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,639
because I wanna Adams my list a valid
users that now exists in Active

276
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Directory

277
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:04,080
casey you see we got several felony
counts here UK

278
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,790
going back you those topless here's all
the ballot counts I had

279
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,530
validated through this demonstration we
even have that skill service account on

280
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:17,960
there

281
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,720
this time around I'm going back and I'm
actually is a password or sever summer

282
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,240
14 which is pretty common

283
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,500
you guys probably know that and look how
fast this process girls

284
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,740
because all the requests are gonna come
back underneath the second as

285
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,140
naked misplaced slow

286
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,890
yes fixer okay

287
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,170
so we went through several counts and
they all came back in a matter of a few

288
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,070
seconds

289
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,889
I we got lucky got a few successful all
games and just the kind that

290
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:58,890
close out the perfect concept here a

291
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,220
yeah initially when I first found this
customers

292
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,720
us which yeah a

293
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,540
we sat on a project for about 24 hours
it was it was a lot of accounts

294
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,740
the yeah you guys we got access to you
now among

295
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:24,740
worldwide address book and I'll I got
protocol

296
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,300
yeah okay so what can we do to reduce
rest

297
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,180
I'll Microsoft actually checks to answer
all

298
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,820
IP address reverse proxy issue in a
roll-up a

299
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,070
they are really bad about time you are
all but was by pretty much haven't seen

300
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,639
in awhile for about a year

301
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,390
I I would disable anything basic
authentication

302
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,550
or 302 redirects on a client access
servers I think I discover services a

303
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,700
complete piece of shit

304
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,010
and everybody should disable it a
Microsoft has no plans thx that more

305
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,670
than two IP addresses

306
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,670
a if you're an ISA Federation services
or even outlook dot com I have not found

307
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,710
as vulnerable to

308
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,190
time an attack it is interesting though
I define

309
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,290
lot of my customers converting over that
outlook dot com

310
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:22,290
that's just for the Adobe way form-based
authentication to where they also run a

311
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,350
Client Access server

312
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,500
just the autodiscover service on a
that's where I'm still able to do that

313
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,900
but then lastly getting turn up your

314
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,390
default log levels and to make
controllers because those are actually

315
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,630
only login locked account

316
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,180
they all outlaw failed logins income in
here actually monitor for behavior

317
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,030
failed logins you'll be able to
determine when a brute force attacks

318
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,860
take place

319
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,860
