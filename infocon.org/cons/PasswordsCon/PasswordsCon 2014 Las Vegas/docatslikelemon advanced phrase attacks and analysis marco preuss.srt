all thanks pare

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,420
arm yes I am

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,790
Marco I'm working with Kaspersky year
and

7
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,680
greats the global research and analysis
team arm so we appear

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,950
arm a globally distributed TMR of

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,539
analysts and researchers working out a
lot of

10
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,890
interesting topics arm

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,440
to about myself averts

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,449
arm principal has produced has set
before

13
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:07,000
I've been here I think it's my third
stall can't pass what's console Vegas

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,810
and also on

15
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,140
are no way and its

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,479
unprincipled talking about passwords is
something

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,810
interesting but in principle there's

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,900
a lot of things which from brings now
but not its

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,939
home hold wakes me up in the morning
that said this way

20
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,220
arm first of all

21
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,189
arm research guy interested and threats
so

22
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,658
my main job then awesome medication is

23
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,740
I am course fighting the bad guys having
the good guys

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,360
and the its are taking Carol Bartz

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,810
everything what's going on and one of my

26
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,229
very special interests private

27
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,860
and also business and stuff cause
something which

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,049
also brings me up at night every now and
then

29
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,729
the question of pasta it's because its
sole harm

30
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,259
central to all today's live but also in
the past

31
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,160
and arm SM the guy interested also in

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,690
things and IT security for

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,750
and in computers for many years now I
just one start up its

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,260
in the past when it comes to pass routes
and exactly in

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,810
1973 such as forty-one years ago not
forty-two

36
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,629
sadly arm their own the mainframe
systems

37
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:40,069
I am so this is for example univac
ninety-six is system which was used to

38
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,929
mean lot of universities

39
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,950
I am may be here soon more interesting
picture

40
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,790
and these machines for Houston mostly
university sorbic

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,150
I and corporations worldwide on US and
Europe and so on

42
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,200
and even their these question arose with
the

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,659
from passports of course because on the
system's had many many users

44
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:11,040
I not everyone had his personal computer
or notebook or smartphone or whatever

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,069
but you had one big sent from machine
and a lot of different people

46
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,599
just got access to landlocked on the
system's

47
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,720
arms so i justs a

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,359
read a bit on the internet and yes he
had one

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,670
university for example they had their
only

50
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,159
kind of policy how they created the
default passwords for the people

51
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,659
just going there which was Stevie Arthur
States

52
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,879
hope these people so long maybe not the

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,459
most interest maybe not the most wise
thing to do

54
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,069
and in general all these mainframes

55
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,208
from this particular area had these

56
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,650
limit of Max act eight characters

57
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,989
and it's very limited set of features of
course

58
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,260
but still most of the

59
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,060
today's computer areas Rd sign in that
way from

60
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,920
back up the seventies and eighties and
whatever other people with white coats

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,059
for standing in front of BigMachines

62
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,570
handling all that stuff all that
security thing means

63
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,149
and the Nama user had nothing to do

64
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,780
but just talk and then to the stuff and

65
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,979
switching from the past but to the
future

66
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,440
arm I'd don't think that the

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,490
is are question of up indication
especially passwords pass raises

68
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,110
dan coats whatever I'll would just drop
because

69
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,509
many many new funny things were come up
like the Internet of Things

70
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,300
we're all kind of different devices like
also my watch

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,560
in smartphones and even Mike stuff it
home

72
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,389
will be connected to the Internet
somehow and there will be a lot of

73
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:03,430
there are and will be more cloud
services now that stuff handling data

74
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,680
storing data

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,270
so you don't have everything local
anymore but everything is summer

76
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,698
and to access your own data you of
course needs

77
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,060
passports right

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,210
I am from thats coming to

79
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,270
today harm

80
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,340
there is Stevie him phrase I hadn't
title of my

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,159
presentation two cats like lemon up this
was just some

82
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,199
praise switch come to my mind because im

83
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,530
I like cats of course and the

84
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,090
clemens is also something interesting
and forevers

85
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,580
everybody interested here and this
question

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,469
I am spoil our own caps don't like
lemons

87
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,020
but room why this phrase

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,940
I mean that's quite interesting because
awesome docs don't like lemons per

89
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,150
anyway why this phrase arm

90
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,568
I look to bits who owns and reading all
that use and all that stuff

91
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,630
and its I came for example toothless
saying

92
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,490
I am maybe some of you in this audience
know there's

93
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,160
make old creating complex passwords

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,880
easy to guess hard to remember so let's
do something better chests combine some

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,780
common words and make it

96
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,789
hard to guess and easy to remember

97
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,289
and also on Lifehacker they had is

98
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,610
from article about that stuff

99
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,009
arm like the type of password:

100
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,569
methods how it can be solved easily and
what's

101
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,470
period of time and the security level so
when I just have a look at the last one

102
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,229
year

103
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,370
this is fun more than 2,500 years

104
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,479
new interesting okay

105
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,520
arm of course some I was talking with
people

106
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,680
and a good friend of mine came to me and
said hey

107
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,729
sheesh these past but raises

108
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,568
that's something something interesting

109
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,229
the new term have a deeper look at that

110
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,639
a because there are many truths out
there

111
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,560
getting into the cereal like brute
forcing Andrew Wilson

112
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,750
complex password cracking and so on

113
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,789
arm but what about past betrays

114
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:34,030
words just combined used his password

115
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,880
and one thing in this area you have to
keep in mind is

116
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
for become one pass routes we already
know

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,500
arm people are lazy is sold they use

118
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,810
their stuff which is easy to remember
like

119
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,300
pet names night when you have a cat's
I'll

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,889
you just use kantor the name of your cat
or is something else like

121
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:04,919
easy to guess star ants may be lazy
people would just also use

122
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,810
this stuff when it comes to pass what
raises just come and stuff which

123
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,740
de noel my cat is my cat has named its

124
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,949
lemon for example asahara how hard is it

125
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,990
to guess this kind of password

126
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,160
harm and after thinking about all that
stuff

127
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,560
I am course I like

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,440
coating a bit and psych credits

129
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,000
my own to loom forum making the deeper
research in that area

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,219
combat before of course when creating

131
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,769
or generating or trying to to research
in the areas you need some

132
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,930
akcent I and I will start with that

133
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,649
my troops I am

134
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,720
when people use a from

135
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,750
2012 use password phrases stay in
normally will

136
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,990
I use some common phrases and I credit
just some small crawlers going on some

137
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,230
web sites

138
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,860
arm like credits this from about the
witches Sabbat German website I don't

139
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,529
think you know this

140
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,380
and also Pasig nyse:c locks because this
is also interesting

141
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,470
to get just a lot of common sentences
and text files

142
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,839
I'll what people and how people are
riding so I don't use

143
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,769
books for example because steer more
artificial

144
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,870
it's not the common language people use
and how people think

145
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,010
I am so I wanted to get to the real
stuff

146
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,200
and when a chance from

147
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,740
means for example here you see that's
just term

148
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,320
common stuff how people ride they have
their own

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,580
are things how they shorten words and
how they

150
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,050
rephrase words and how they combine
stuff

151
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,800
I am so I credit me in this smart
two-thirds

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,920
as some a basis

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,709
so based on that %uh photo came I am

154
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,760
and you too lemme make sense of all that
stuff

155
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,079
have now tons of text fund spurs

156
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,250
our words and everything hah to make
sense of all that stuff

157
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,680
soul I stepped into creating a database
why database

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,329
what for and principal what I'm doing
here is

159
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,750
arm what you may be no from from

160
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,500
Markov chains what's already there like
the common Markov chains you have and

161
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,940
password cracking tools are based on
characters like

162
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,010
a hall of -1 character Houston

163
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,120
followed by which other character and a
principal

164
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,570
I'm doing the same just with complete
words

165
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,070
I am so I'm parsing are these text file

166
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,180
its are setting everything into a
database is

167
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,459
are storing the frequency year of the
year word so how often it occurs in a

168
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,219
text

169
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,850
and then harm which words follow up
after a base word

170
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,320
and this also with frequencies toward

171
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,720
arm I made it a bit more perm
interesting for me because

172
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,940
these context fights are messy

173
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,260
I so I credits stuff like our new lines
are handled

174
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,000
their comments for example they don't
new line doesn't

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,910
a doesn't have any relation to the line
before because one line is one sentence

176
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,810
of course make sense

177
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,449
house with get trash which doesn't make
sense at all

178
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,750
I am how these words are split it
because not everybody is just flirting

179
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,300
with the white space but something else

180
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,779
I am words must be clean because you may
have some

181
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,389
numbers upper case lower case some lead
stuff inside which just

182
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,500
need to be removed and its

183
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,050
I want to be a bit flexible solar
extension of all that stuff show it's

184
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,979
just a minute

185
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,550
and one very important thing I don't use
was much woods

186
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,560
stop words this is something I'll

187
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,829
what you normally read when handling par
seeing now working with text files you

188
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,469
have a list of stuff words

189
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,290
you don't want to use but principal at
the stop for its also

190
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,860
words people may use and phrases so I
don't clean out any words like to know

191
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,060
or he/she whatever

192
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,170
I leave them all and side to the full
relations

193
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,790
um yes

194
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,550
hmm sheesh

195
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,889
its has from yep its

196
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,940
but this use

197
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,160
ok im principal home

198
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,130
am just show you first him

199
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,029
on because interesting

200
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,060
to 'em show you what's yeah I know

201
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,689
thats

202
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,670
I personally like I am writing my config
files directly and pies and soul

203
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,939
I'm using pies in for that stuff because
it was just easy

204
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,700
I'll is it a ride as I'm writing
everything and pie sensor for the

205
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,010
country rations because it's easier than
to handle and I

206
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,250
avoid audits parsing stuff because older
own library checking all these

207
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,529
configurations

208
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,880
so that it doesn't go messy I N

209
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,810
and here you see the stuff for to
mention before like respect newline at

210
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,550
that's interesting how to split for its

211
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,620
arm if centration non printable
characters should be for that all it if

212
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,560
number should be cleaned out

213
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
analysis stuff which is more which is
also interesting

214
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,638
I am some people like to ride everything
in uppercase

215
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,649
tool shallots and the Internet

216
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,120
or a just lazy people who write
everything in lower case so

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,579
any tool somehow think about is and

218
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,399
think are you want to use it at your
database

219
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,510
for creating phrases and its

220
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,060
much just have this year

221
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,768
see in

222
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,550
first I want to create new database and
I use

223
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,170
my Chu the new

224
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,529
the mushroom sheesh

225
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:42,300
from she

226
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,209
mensch sure man two screens

227
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:50,209
messed up

228
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,199
some ok im

229
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:57,829
I'm pretty much just read in the year
p.m.

230
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,489
comments from Reddit in this example
harm

231
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,040
and it gives me in this case I have the
limit of ahold

232
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,760
the bike ride this website of 7800 its

233
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,930
unique words I am which are now

234
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,019
in my database and can be used the
extension was something

235
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:22,190
I created because when I just wanna at
something you

236
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,670
I N hi don't want to create every time
for database again

237
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,670
it takes time love aplomb so

238
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,759
at just created this extends harm

239
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,269
just insert the bitch from other item
which doesn't make sense in this case it

240
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,550
just says example

241
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,609
because red is mostly English bitch I'm
about as chairman so

242
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,120
they are not many mix-ups here and you
just see that an increase to conduct the

243
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,750
words

244
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,899
the unique for its to more than 9,000

245
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,399
600 I N

246
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,709
with this database arm

247
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:08,888
which is a bits complex arm

248
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,970
I like tooling tool which allows it to
bits

249
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,300
people who know my past presentations
knows that I like

250
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,258
visualizations so I did it for this
database to

251
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,470
and tear the word frequencies so you
clearly see

252
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,199
especially the the year um the stopper
it's like the

253
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,469
in with is and so on

254
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,560
and the thing you which is more
interesting Rd relations

255
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,479
which look a bit like this harm

256
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,500
so you can sets you cannot read it of
course

257
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,070
have because the image is much larger
harm

258
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,730
but every dot here is the word and with
the lines you can see

259
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,500
the year relations to other words arm

260
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,940
so one word followed by another word
followed by another word put up another

261
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,060
word

262
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,730
and for all these transitions I store of
course the frequency

263
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,339
to make it easier when generating
phrases

264
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,609
on which brings me expected to this
point

265
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,688
hmm here this is

266
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,039
hmm

267
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,069
interesting onto the config again a
store disc

268
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,520
this is something very important just a
note to the

269
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,220
everybody if anybody is interested in
going to that area

270
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,940
on the amount of data is really pick

271
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,250
overtime especially when generating all
that stuff

272
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,669
depends on the tablets I and directly
writing

273
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:48,450
everything to the disk because to memory
will exceed within a few seconds

274
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,850
I N the working with strict explained in
a bit

275
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,809
and then on generating based on the
database

276
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,990
arm have several different kind of

277
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,210
arm have settings to use

278
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,900
first this is incremental which is Scott
system

279
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,410
interesting feature like if you want to
combine several words

280
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,940
do you want to follow every step like in
your output you want to have word one

281
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,490
then but one were to but one were to
words three and so on or just a final

282
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,090
thing

283
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,610
but one were to what's really what five
and so on

284
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,260
I am DX sect phrases

285
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,549
has commonly and a Markov

286
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,049
arm things defined with the threat as
threshold in length

287
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:42,590
arm so the length defines how many words

288
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,610
are combines I'm together from the
transitions you have

289
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,030
and the threshold arm defines

290
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,059
the year harm key priority of the words

291
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,539
on to what extent the word should be
combined

292
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,090
a another nice feature added is 243
rings

293
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,159
so for example if you have one word not
enough transitions to create like a

294
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,419
5 phrase combination aren't the most
frequent words from your database will

295
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,200
be appended

296
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,250
to a have the full hmm

297
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,520
length of 5 and also played a bit with

298
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,970
all combinations and permutations which
just means

299
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,750
that the year arm the harm

300
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,090
structure of the year combinations

301
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,610
I am are flexible soul with the words

302
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,990
are first in order and then mixed around
with India output

303
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,049
hard to have 'em broader and much of
that stuff

304
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,610
I how does look like might there's

305
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,219
one more

306
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,730
tests

307
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,900
hi im hmm additionally this is for the
year

308
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,110
there are some basic rules harm

309
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,350
how these words are a combined like was

310
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,770
some split character in between

311
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,980
and also how many characters from a word
should be a

312
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,690
on should be appended combined because

313
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,350
normally people may use different word

314
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,629
but they also may use just a first

315
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,809
letter a forward like the Iran

316
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,250
to my cats numb two cats like lemon

317
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,700
a DEC year a no

318
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,630
hell maybe for example a phrase because
it's just a first letter of every word

319
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,620
combined together and this is a setting
which I also on

320
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,850
on implement a tiered to make its a bit
more flexible

321
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,439
hmm

322
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,150
for the year mode which I had before him
and this is

323
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,860
from an interesting thing I have in
principle three different modes

324
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,469
harm implemented how to create phrases

325
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,789
first is creating phrases

326
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,950
on the database by itself so every word
in a database

327
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,970
will be in extend its arm

328
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,980
truly the common phrases which may sound
interesting

329
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,169
and may be worth trying on a second mode
is

330
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:36,620
20 are extend the given dictionary so
for example if you have a rock you

331
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,309
it just use rock you and every word

332
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,780
arm from rock you would be checked
against a database

333
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,970
and if the word his and the database it
will be extended by the known

334
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,860
transitions

335
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,840
so if they're real words can rock your
and your dictionary you feat in

336
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,100
I rendezvous beach just extended to rule
the natural

337
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,250
on harm

338
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,190
relation what they have to will give me
words in a database

339
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,320
and second modus a bit more complex

340
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,950
arm to combine through different
dictionaries

341
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,100
so for example if you give them hmm the
rock you

342
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,709
has base dictionary and the completely
different

343
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,039
dictionary has for extension the year

344
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,940
arm words from from the second from the
extension dictionary

345
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,620
will be a I am will be created

346
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,939
and appended to every word from the
rocks you

347
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,179
so to have a the rocks you a for example
that the ruptured word

348
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,640
and then all the combinations based on
the second dictionary

349
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,909
to make it even more complex which is
through your phone

350
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,500
and in my example I'd just use

351
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,289
the some much

352
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:01,000
instruments have just created a small
subset for a cure love

353
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,640
one hundred and trees to make it a bit
faster

354
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,789
hmm and then hip hop

355
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:12,780
put forward too long I look like

356
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,649
such writing was one and as a bit

357
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,690
so this for example for rock you so you
have the

358
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,870
the base for it which out the first two
characters

359
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,250
and for every word which is in the
database

360
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,730
just the first to look characters
appended

361
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,270
and i'd to skip the incremental so this
is

362
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,799
the fool a length I want to have I looks
quiets

363
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:47,510
random but there's really a meaning
behind it

364
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:54,510
and Kim

365
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,080
hmm here that's what I mention different
motilium

366
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,860
incremental outputs threshold and things
plus for us

367
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,580
and the them or

368
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,100
idea on and the advance combinations

369
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,049
nothing hmm I had a look at harm

370
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,179
boss based on the state obeys iron

371
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:23,260
analyzing phrases

372
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,200
from stuff you have so for example if
you have a list of

373
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,620
passions for example and you just soft a
few of them

374
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,719
so you know in which direction it may co
I you could stay just pasted into and

375
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,270
use

376
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,460
your create a database in order to

377
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,190
on make sense of the stuff you already
know

378
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,289
to know which area to follow

379
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:51,090
eileen's my headed tits

380
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,970
sheesh shrum undermines

381
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,890
I am and this fire I am

382
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,480
just at a two things this and this is
fun which is take sample from

383
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,730
from Lifehacker up to just show

384
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,010
arm the potential beyond that

385
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,658
on has sold to you word this

386
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,900
was checked against the database it's
not a phrase

387
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,640
because it's a full word known in the
database

388
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,090
and this is from from Lifehacker for
example

389
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,279
this is known appears a 324

390
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,049
time sold this to occur in sandy wrought
text you parse

391
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:37,900
arm football creating the database is

392
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,100
is the transition is unknown
transitional this

393
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,199
a with the frequency of 30 in so
thirteen times

394
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,240
iron which is quite high arm

395
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,690
his this followed by is and fun

396
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,120
as again a transition of his I am

397
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,399
frequency one so on one from all that
cases from your raw data

398
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,240
on fun is a followed

399
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,760
from by his his is followed by fun

400
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,970
this on so you know that this is a

401
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,130
through transition your future this is
fun

402
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,320
so you just may use your dictionary

403
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,370
your database an order to generate just

404
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,699
are that similar stuff so its food word
so you don't wanna strip characters

405
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,750
to a given said to just 12 creative

406
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,090
fool words from your database out and
just let it run

407
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,860
against your analysts and hopefully
you'll a

408
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,090
have fun something good which

409
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,750
but high noticed and so will leaks which
are known

410
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,809
I am you have already these kind of

411
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,178
phrase combinations but sometimes
followed

412
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:58,220
or pre pendant was numbers and this of
course you can't just easily solved with

413
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,820
any

414
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,490
like OC and has cut or whatever with a
pending pre-planned rules

415
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,919
to just add numbers arm to them

416
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,210
given thing and then you have a new
source of

417
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,909
some I am input for your own

418
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:20,789
hmm project you're running

419
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:24,610
for analyzing I already have cold but I
haven't

420
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,678
implemented as yet because it's not
fully tested

421
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,750
harm house a plan to use arm

422
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,470
and gramm's different distance
algorithms and I also have some stuff

423
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,409
more

424
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:39,679
like entropy checks and stuff I'll for
doing even more deeper

425
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,470
analysis from given phrases against a
database

426
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,490
to make even more sense are that the
stuff you already have

427
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,679
to find new maybe patterns and all that
stuff

428
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,179
to beam bit more efficient and its

429
00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:00,200
I also wanted to extend the rule
generation for the phrases

430
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,679
in order to be a bit more how flexible
and

431
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,130
what's your output will be so I'm nearly
out of time

432
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,100
not just one thing left to say be
awesome and fights

433
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,360
and a good direction and if you have

434
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,139
any questions just ping me I'll be here
on dan also Def Con

435
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,380
or much for the handle adjusts

436
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,120
drop me a note and its yes

437
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,689
currently it just to take this question
before I

438
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,840
currently don't plan through lose to
release the two yet

439
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,309
because once I haven't implemented
everything gets I what I want to chat

440
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:40,690
for a

441
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,980
analyzing and also I wanted to

442
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,549
play a bit more with that stuff and
let's see if

443
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:50,789
in no way at the next bus with scorn
hike given

444
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,230
next talk or in extend its second talk

445
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,000
on this topic but if you have any
question in that area

446
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,500
just come to me and we talk about

447
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,750
thanks
