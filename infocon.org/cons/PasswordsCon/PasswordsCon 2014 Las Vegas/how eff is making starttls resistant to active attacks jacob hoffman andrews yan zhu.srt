38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
I'm but we all look at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation how many of you have

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,489
heard a bf

40
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,370
of some so I'm not gonna so what it is
but we're here

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,629
you should learn more about as a beacon
our booth on StubHub she gave a great

42
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,950
talk earlier today

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,149
about start your last says the psych
awesome

44
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,290
of thing that everyone should implement
but and reality are

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,890
SMTP e-mail transmission is mostly in
secure

46
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,458
how many people knew that ISO

47
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,599
doubts many slides are going to be
things in you also this is what parent

48
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,500
says hi Hannah said earlier

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,170
but if you have you know if you have
some mail servers like

50
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,599
I like I could be on your network doing
this and looking up passwords

51
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,720
if you're not using stock deal a speaker
has things are just Sun uninterrupted

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,430
I am and also guess what I'm doing that
Ali NSA

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,530
sonya is aside from excuse cool and I
shows

54
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,760
on emit aside a tougher email sessions
and Facebook's oceans and so forth being

55
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
collected and text

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,829
and so you know could end up like this
and then I say they are pissed

57
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,200
and from mom prism sides we see that
they're doing the subscale

58
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
um which means they're using me a
passive surveillance

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,750
a more abundant a pic of it public so
here is our job

60
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,940
here's what my colleague peter sellers
are 0240

61
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,349
kinds of threats we think about when we
say like you know you well as in secure

62
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,720
possible hacker such as the NSA and
Paris um

63
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,030
in your office possible hikers with a
special power of key compromise

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,340
up there with hackers and especially
supposed to get up to the hacks and

65
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,739
we'll get into what those mean

66
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,230
so earlier today how many people out the
talk

67
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,250
okay so I today all possible hackers

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,330
we all know you know you turn on start
your last year good and Bihar doing on

69
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,709
that

70
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,260
so I I want winners this um

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,399
July is so tight June 2013

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
right after snowed in a happened %uh huh

73
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,440
we are doing so that's a gmail Carlos I
listened to have start your ass but

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
they're so it wasn't actually Ballard

75
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,729
and none of these other three big mail
providers

76
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,599
on were doing %uh and your New Year's as
good as Gmail

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,620
a nearby actually all kinda formally to
the survey

78
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,229
with that we call encrypt the way we %ah
service providers ahh

79
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,900
what which for which of these things are
you doing an are so we have things like

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,929
supports HTTPS

81
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,820
arm supports its best foot forward
secrecy support starting us

82
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,370
lol we started there was a lot of red
and gray like people weren't encrypting

83
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,770
armelle you know but then we kept
bothering them bothering them and

84
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,020
finally by like May 2014 we see a lot
more green so

85
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,500
all at sea like Dropbox Yahoo Arlington

86
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,199
um sonic already had a Twitter

87
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,699
well well what we're doing good I am and
I gmail recently released the state data

88
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,389
shows that you know on corruption on
average

89
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:30,229
what's not tell us has been rising Aug
30 32 fifty-eight percent depending on

90
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,109
how you look at it

91
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,460
sense the summer last year

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,758
also but all were really interested in
pulling this crap

93
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,300
further back in time in which to split
don't billing no how

94
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,889
on things like encrypt the weapons no
don't have affected star tell us

95
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,289
and that's where you come in so we have
some scripts that you can run

96
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,729
on your math history to see percentage a
bomb

97
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,520
sucio assumption and so forth so I'm

98
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,180
but you know there is also possible
talks with sophisticated as

99
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,389
assistance which is key facts in this
case um

100
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,020
you know what's easiest way for hackers
to I have a lot of the mailbox is a set

101
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,340
a

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,900
cuba not somalian tric up these
long-term session keys I'm sure

103
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,000
all-out sorry long time cues I'm sure
you all know this um

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
just over prime acute something like
harpley it or just by compromising the

105
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,119
server

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,940
you get all the mail but if he is
perfect for its secrecy on the damage

107
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,060
isn't as bad cuz you can we compromise
from that point forward

108
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,270
up to 100 on perfect for its secrecy for
SMTP a bit so important

109
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,520
his party lost 1.2 but

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,590
you know how do we spend as a Service
said I only want to use tools 1.2

111
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,869
but and North also the Tigers active
network attacks

112
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,389
which are really easy what started us in
case you missed it too and earlier talk

113
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,090
because the way star tell us what's very
opportunistic

114
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,560
one side says I want sir tell us and the
other says I also want start to us and

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,039
then

116
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,050
you know you have this negotiation I'll
but you know what

117
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,160
as a one-off Paris followers points out
you can just see if you're on the

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,590
networking industry about that start to
us

119
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,469
and we just fall out two in secure SMTP
and we're back where we started

120
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,729
you can also do a at Yas man in the
middle

121
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:21,880
um so are a lot of SMTP its service that
you start your lust don't have valid

122
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,909
certificates

123
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,860
and that is barely enforced so you can
see our meanest

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,240
weapon Facebook on the far left I love
this

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,770
servers that support 30 us only about
how

126
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,698
%uh demonstrated about latella
certificate

127
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,599
I so what do you do for these other
three nom I guess other

128
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,599
up two things gonna it knowing the third
one for second

129
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,330
'em so under what are we have something
called

130
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,550
HST us which is a way for server to say
arm when you see

131
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,750
no I'm not and get clone

132
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,550
and all that Jacob do the second part of
this talk if I can figure out how to

133
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,370
%uh get to this so we're gonna have them
do a screen share on Google Hangouts

134
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,430
she's pretty nu for having on

135
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,740
I take up so you're near faces now on

136
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,210
the screen I

137
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,460
so a %uh so

138
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,198
everyone I'll I'll make sure you can
forget about it clear

139
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,180
so politicized arms at all US

140
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,060
everywhere nicest RTLS use the

141
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,098
30 a.m. after RJ got I think people are
like

142
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,409
not wanting to sit on a front as much as
I wanted them to do so if you'd like

143
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,120
part really loudly not be great and I'll
try to dues a microphone work to

144
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,000
the action a know you have a

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,380
what happened to her assist doubt most
intractable

146
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,779
if you oppose fixer and moderately

147
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,089
I'll so she a

148
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:07,649
I'll it's one that's informed with I

149
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,410
a Internet experience with it it just
yes sir

150
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,790
it just yes water and also by that

151
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,810
yes experience what HTTPS

152
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,099
everywhere I'll so a

153
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,740
probably similar mister transfer
security data

154

now and past this first is it

155
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:31,870
problem first time you visit her website
it

156
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,140
how do you know that it supports

157
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,439
a is to yeps your follow first time you
visit

158
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,700
so quick Firefox take the approach

159
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,100
a for the day a number but its

160
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,290
into that as well say okay we are having
just

161
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,480
a this I which seems a that what scale
but

162
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,540

getting a chest yes for you this a.m
o'connor

164
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,019
a significant fraction that similar

165
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,529
a yeah as the school doesn't accept

166
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,829
HTTPS Everywhere which is

167
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,979
a scoreless tie sites support

168
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,430
just yes a and

169
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,880
as it actually help scale supposedly

I have an eye on your mail servers on
set up a date

392
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,309
I would also like to take this moment to
announce that we are hiring for the

393
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,158
technology to stop a DFF

394
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,029
and if you join you won't have to do
annoying things like

395
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:05,450
do presentations over Google Hangouts
with us I turn to YouTube video

396
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,669
ninety-nine percent of the time um

397
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,720
yeah so I can make a few quick questions
but we gotta get out of here in like two

398
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,299
minutes

399
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:16,330
yeah down I him

400
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,519
act I'm drifting through this to buy

401
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,630
max domains up

402
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,130
how I noticed there to you're talking
about the slide what do people can see

403
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,210
right now right to asylum adjacent I
things are listed by MX domains

404
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,750
now maybe these big huge organizations
have everything together

405
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,169
but most email administrators

406
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,940
will fess up that they've got some MX
backup

407
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,340
bed is Jess not up to date with
everything else right to you

408
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,840
right so to repeat the question for gay
couple can't hear you are so the

409
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,990
question was so we list a max demands in
the states on config file

410
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,750
but large are you know companies will
have like backup

411
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,309
.mx demands arm that on on a server up
to date and whatever

412
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:08,519
on so how do you deal with the the
backups on

413
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,419
take up the 1i think this question share
said the question great it's actually

414
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,779
the other way around a

415
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:18,039
yeah on sys admins are more likely to
have

416
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,019
she moved back to accept that sir well

417
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,159
and that's true a you know you do
double-checking

418
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,909
is before we had anything seven-fold and

419
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:33,549
unless all the rednecks goodness II have
school

420
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:38,500
I was 34 for instance owns a class II
about sweat

421
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,360
with them %uh and so if you specifically
want to be a part

422
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,649
start til it's over a get your house and
all

423
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,059
and you know us and so in other words

424
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:56,049
but we don't want to miss it if it means
that

425
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,529
have I and that's what does that mean
alright

426
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:04,370
thats picture plus because think that
this is how to IM
