1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,390
them okay I'll

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,910
it started and there's no repost I guess
so up

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,080
my name's tanneries I I'm to be talking
about this

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,460
an interesting little project I am it
something sort of fell in my lap

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,679
up from doing other IT related stuff and

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,470
been workers for for many years in and
talking to people but

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,499
com I you know how I managed my online
identities

8
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:32,668
on couple people suggested I should put
together our talk about this and

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,739
kinda share this and maybe start a
debate on

10
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,760
so I am just one get the subway

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,750
I am because I work for a large company
they don't want their name associated

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,230
with the south these are

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,078
as my own work amount I'm I think that
my party to look at my bio

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,249
I just because by companies listed on
the a on the profile

15
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:57,039
so personal history how I got involved
in this

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,809
um one time you want you know dot com
starts rather rage

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,940
om I somehow became an email admin I'll
basically people

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,100
were asking me to set up e-mail I'll
because I could not

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,559
kinda did pretty easily in wasn't a big
deal for me so I am

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,950
hosting a lot of the means for people
who were doing so that's just because

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,000
then easy now they were trying to get
started and

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,520
I am you know I could take care for them

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,939
so um basically I ran the side in the
house

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,969
om and you know back in the

25
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:33,429
up late 90s I am no DSL was just kinda
coming online so

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,130
was not a band with up servers weren't
that our phone so

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,420
I'd got hit with all the other things to
come along with us an email for what

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,380
some other people was

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,048
my been with got saturated I get spanned
server load it said around so

30
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,859
I am you know it it became a moreover
nuisance me at some point where

31
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,669
I was basically you know doing all this
stuff and it really wasn't what I was

32
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,859
trying to do I was trying to do my own
sort of that time

33
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,979
so been um

34
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,869
you know I was looking for ways I could
better manage just because this was

35
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,210
causing problems I mean might

36
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,910
in having cut fully saturated month when
I couldn't do anything at all so

37
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,530
I happen to come across this idea I

38
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,860
from the financial industry they have a
single control pain the numbers

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,300
and I mean have hurt by this before ok I
feel you

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,490
so the idea behind this is its pretty
neat its anti-fraud measure

41
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,780
essentially its it's a tokenization a
credit card so

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,820
when you could make an online purchase
instead using your actual credit card

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,269
number

44
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,580
right you go to their website are you
have an application and it generates

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,680
effectively a one-time use credit card
or the content to be

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,340
but one merchant as well so you can use
multi as both in same margin

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,980
and some it sort of protection measure
right

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,700
so now if somebody happens to get your
credit card

49
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,720
%uh that you've tokenizer effectively I
it's no good to them because

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,550
its other only good with that merchant
or it's only good for one transaction

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,220
so um and this is going to be concept
it's been around

52
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,820
number our credit for companies to offer
this um

53
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,700
but its you know it's not very popular
lot of people don't know about it

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,959
um so I talked about this to people them
never permits in a bit

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,220
arm that I think discover on
discontinued at the Sir

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,609
so them neat idea but is also came about
because you have to go to a website

57
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,500
login

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,700
generate a card copy pasted I guess
that's kinda

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,570
and there better ways to solve fraud arm
that people are

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,010
are I am you leverage on and also
doesn't help when

61
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,149
people do silly things like this and
poster

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,830
credit cards and Twitter so some that
really wasn't a

63
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,320
its kinda a novelty solution I think for
so

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,170
for the financial industry arm I know I
know that they're still

65
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,450
some provider so offering this but arm
largely

66
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,010
arm me you know bob was neat idea but
probably too technical and

67
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,370
are they did market well to consider to
the consumer so

68
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,440
this got me thinking you know virtually
no

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,710
take the same concept apply to me now
right can solve my spam problem

70
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,950
cannot control the load you known what
if I gave everyone unique

71
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,969
randomized Madras arm you know the first
thing I would get out that would be

72
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:21,358
you know source attribution if someone
were to

73
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,388
you know abuse that email so if somebody
had a arm

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,349
it's only sold my email right thing you
know early 2000's rate

75
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,719
I that was probably more common arm

76
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:35,889
and where somebody did have a compromise
and something I was getting scammed

77
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,819
I can just simply you know they were the
No police I know where it came from

78
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:44,500
so um you can get

79
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,539
cell

80
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,849
um no I thought about you know how we
can use this

81
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:55,620
and arm and how to put together and so
there are some

82
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,719
some ways you can do this yourself right
gmail you can add a hyphen input

83
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:59,930
whatever you want the end

84
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,370
on accept that you know and we can
figure out drop anything at the height

85
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,669
and have the recount

86
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,080
I so I can just keep send me know their
I looked as

87
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,628
look better job where you can actually
create new account effectively as an

88
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,419
alias

89
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,068
copies up to go in and manage all those
so you can actually just go generate new

90
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:16,889
in

91
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,150
its its effect to the nearly as but went
into doing for myself

92
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,359
was I originated this this us we called

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
a hoarder om and and modified it

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,509
and then added this six this I am
customization to it so

95
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,689
we go any scheme in you look at the
settings right you can

96
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,770
about the findings like when you send
any now here's your name

97
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,128
well I just basically at the buttons
that one that says generate a new

98
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,139
I bailey's and on the back side it would

99
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,770
you don't call out a random function
generate something and

100
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,990
add it to my held up store and
eventually had moved to

101
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,819
roundcube does get sick oval patches on
on the short side but on effect is the

102
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:56,889
same concept right

103
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,139
where i have a web site I go and I wanna
do this I also added to my address book

104
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,960
so now I have a need to track it so

105
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,969
as an ad in The Sims I have an address
book entry that says

106
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,729
I this our unique identifiers associated
with this

107
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,550
site so now I can up keep keep tabs on

108
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,050
on how a museum mom initialing I decided
to use 32 random characters

109
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,860
and I'm funny thing about that is that a
lot of

110
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,889
web sites when you go to fill out a form

111
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,969
they have limits on email links up clean
by the way the event bright side if you

112
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,370
have a register for peace advance 50
characters

113
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,949
um so I reduce its sixteen just because
that's akin

114
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,099
a problem arm and in fact

115
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,819
um some sites um are been funnier in
that

116
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,550
if I use the same %ah that I use the
same you user ID

117
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,289
as also the Login ID on some states are
even less than that

118
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:55,870
so you can have a user ID that sixteen
on but the happily take

119
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,800
more than hot sexy no more characters
when you ask you to log in but not

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,210
during the sign up process

121
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,719
so I am for example there is I one site

122
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:09,900
I am where I had already said 15 I am so
I these pledges truncated right

123
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,960
but when I print when I use that I just
book entry

124
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,349
I have to remember the truncated because
if a sixty no takers an important to go

125
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,819
to log in but it

126
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,849
wall sits in a dialogue me

127
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,520
so after dole this out I cannot see well

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,990
media confronts an interesting stats on
you know

129
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,180
if I get my email address at needed
funds and interesting

130
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,210
always the people sharing my information
and

131
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,229
I so I went in build-up contest

132
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,870
arm that simply razors a pretty call on
but

133
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,550
the effectively I found that these were
really not resolving

134
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,629
charge a lot this man from it but up as
far as source attribution

135
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,620
common finding Ashley anything useful
outta this actually turned out to be

136
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,800
really meaningless it was a lotta noise
I and I end up just deleting all those

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,219
early so they created

138
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,479
I unkind word doc on and

139
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,490
and i cant you Jesus for um no

140
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,669
every login site and he said they had
create a login to continue to generate

141
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:11,740
random ID's

142
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,710
and n yes it took many years crash get a
really good

143
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,359
interesting result

144
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,259
because I was offered a job and this was
gonna need

145
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,629
on so this is the first the first real
up

146
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,939
sorta incident that I found were I had
some good use

147
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,950
above an email address and

148
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,690
um you know clearly this is very
legitimate of course right

149
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,820
a.m. so looking at the headers here

150
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,990
right I found my you know dressed which
miss

151
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,290
you gonna said he spent I had already
deleted scenes but

152
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,949
up so that was very interesting and
ensure no one you happen to randomly

153
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,010
guessed that one

154
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,560
om but haha since I had the same address
book and went in

155
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,589
looked up where this came from

156
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,890
and to my surprise

157
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,199
it was actually turn off so on this is
2009

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,650
um and

159
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,670
so I you know I email them sent you know
they are an email to them to all their

160
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,709
up accounts I could find abuse et cetera

161
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,690
um didn't get any response but I can
piece together what happened here was

162
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,360
that

163
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,070
I the

164
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,440
I had to use I had signed up for a you
know a promo sort of deal

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,510
with top with the Wall Street Journal
and so it was done two or three

166
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,750
third-party marken company and family
they had a breach

167
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,790
and so their count data was stolen and
so therefore my email

168
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,000
start getting spread around so you know

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,730
clearly directed at you get this back to
its source i'd never use anywhere else

170
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,870
except with that

171
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,050
marketing company won a signed up for
I'll so a subscription

172
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,040
in sup vanity more on the way as well

173
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,459
arm demo recorder was a sight

174
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,550
about that that's up so product does a
German company

175
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,949
I nor to download it our trial basically
have to give them

176
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,070
saw the contact form and I send you a
link to download I

177
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,530
while the forms actually third party
company and

178
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,990
I'm so email that's asbestos a one-man
show so you not Christian

179
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,730
and asked if he knew about this in yes
she didn't

180
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,940
so II I he when

181
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,790
and looked into it and found that while
maybe was tied to this marketing company

182
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,160
be set to them in sure enough that she
did have a beach

183
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,420
never bothered to tell him that I'll but
he found that they had reached an

184
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,610
all his all his up customers out had
sought

185
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,510
om how long that going on I I don't know
but prism it's been

186
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,650
out there for some time are similarly
dog eats up tom also had up

187
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,910
arm had a breach now you know this is
our retail sites is the place that

188
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,660
I've given them a credit card right so
om little higher risk for me in that

189
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,410
I'm on giving them potentially
information if the retaining especially

190
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,270
I you know the to be abused at cause me
harm

191
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,620
arm so are similarly

192
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,130
again with all these I on

193
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,480
different incidence they each have their
own unique

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,550
email address so

195
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,660
I got me thinking about how I use my
logins and

196
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,890
and you know you know what if I do
resent acid because

197
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,050
I am i've a lot accounts and I am

198
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,040
yes I use password safe for things that
are really important to me but

199
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,620
I have a lot more counts than I care to
deal with and I really don't want to be

200
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,830
you know I messing around with having to

201
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,850
pull up in password safe every single
time

202
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,380
so arm he got me thinking about I'll

203
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,100
how I can better use this tool I am so
that I don't worry about

204
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,680
passers every year since I per basically
partitioned my

205
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,660
me accounts into a couple buckets where
I have things that I really care about

206
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,400
and I will use some passwords in
conjunction with these randomized

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,520
I login ID's and minimizing addresses

208
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,699
arm and then there's everything else
where I might have a password

209
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,420
team based on the type aside it is I'm
kinda information about them store

210
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,979
so if the have my credit card on family
values a better password

211
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,160
if they don't and medium care as much

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,650
um so it's now says something in return
for a long time

213
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,689
om you know over 10 years now I think

214
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,570
a professional member when I started
doing this but I 451

215
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,880
you know just the right now so I'm

216
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,310
you know if I find they're being abused
to delete them while Mr really stale

217
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,400
and just there you know their silent

218
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,290
yes

219
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,500
so arm for the random it depends on how
I bucket acid so

220
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,790
if for example its a retail site I'm
where I don't think my credit card info

221
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,740
I have a up I have a stronger password

222
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,740
but then I reuse across models multiple
shopping sites

223
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,429
but this certainly doesn't enable them
to have access to an email accounts

224
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,189
because remember

225
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,529
are if they have my little my log into
your email address

226
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,529
and that chair password so soon they
have my password

227
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,149
they have a login ID that you need to
cite they have an email address that

228
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,239
speed internet site

229
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:36,819
I if they wanted to go after my enough
to find all my other

230
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:41,959
emails a login ID is on want that it's
nearly since system so you can't log in

231
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:42,589
with that

232
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,389
I am account so and there's nothing in
there that would keep you in in

233
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:50,799
any indication as to what the the core a
countess

234
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,949
so again this is a randomized at so

235
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:57,979
some it kinda confines attack so
assuming that they have my

236
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,679
information iron they still can't

237
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,379
progress further south contained a
breach at that point

238
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,939
hopefully I um and and so

239
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:13,009
its its a lot maybe a little bit less
stringent as far as

240
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:18,319
you know how I manage in all these caps
up

241
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:21,339
but same time it's also in stand up and
the but

242
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,600
16 made my starters right typing that in

243
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,129
on especially when you know I'll

244
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:32,360
know but just a test %uh Spotify right
or Pandora you have to have a login

245
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,119
and so my blog ID is randomized

246
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:41,360
and so what I have kinda pieced together
is basically process for coping with us

247
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,629
in that I have it in my address book so
I'm at the scene and a look at me I just

248
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,739
spoke copy/paste

249
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,879
it takes an extra twenty thirty seconds
for me to do that

250
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,269
it's a little bit the pain but com

251
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,230
it's readily accessible arm and its also
will be defined enough

252
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,449
touchback on that whites candid
different and how it's

253
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,339
I you know why I think this is actually
interesting arm

254
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,579
but on the iPhone of course you know I
mean have access to that I just broke so

255
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:10,029
easily

256
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,329
so I i'm I can just go search my inbox

257
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,248
so I have probably have an email that
was sent to that account so

258
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,489
I'll just make sure I save me now and I
can just pull it up really quickly

259
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:24,899
copy and paste send them to my login

260
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,970
it's also kinda fun when you're

261
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,360
and interacting with rich and so I've
had this happen a couple times where

262
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,269
I checking out from hotel and they want
they don't they want to move away from

263
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,939
paper

264
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:40,110
so %uh it's kinda funny police up and
they want to look good

265
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,410
you know send you an unconfirmed the
email address for your invoice

266
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,230
and yes you know I'm feeling sent

267
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,029
I can have a little fun with a mochi
have been meted out arm

268
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,959
it's also interesting in that I I've
also had worked the other way

269
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,368
where I arm I signed up to get access to
my health records

270
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:03,709
and so you gold this website thoughts on
Paul's information identifies

271
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,439
you know your medical record ID number
in serra and then someone has a

272
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,689
actually go review its not an automated
process so it takes a couple days

273
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:14,629
and so I went so well as information and
then I got a call back

274
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:17,869
I got a call from from the other health
care provider

275
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:22,509
and they said we have this request for a
up for an account

276
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,059
and it look to really suspicious to us
can you confirm that

277
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:30,118
that's actually you in that and I said
don't mean the the

278
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,519
the the Login ID n email address not yet
my guess is

279
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,899
its its legitimate so sometimes people
pay attention but mostly it's its

280
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,639
is it is kinda fun us to see if people
react to that um

281
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:48,639
yes them

282
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:57,209
well so it's it's not necessarily um I'm
not always using one device

283
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,669
right so I might be I logging in this
map look

284
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:04,949
I have a desktop computer up to my
iPhone I've got a tablet

285
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,149
I'm I'm pulling up accounts in number
different places I really wanna have

286
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:10,398
something to a more portable

287
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:14,138
I'm sure I can keep it on a you know if
a user pass from Jake

288
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:17,299
keep it on USB stick rain I can carry
around in a course that increases the

289
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,128
risk me losing at stake in

290
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:22,490
where I've also had this happen to me
where I am

291
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,929
up base goodnight my USB stick at
damaged

292
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:29,889
and i'd wasn't as good about keeping it
seeped

293
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:33,389
without you know without for posit or a
way to keep a backup

294
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:36,520
so I lost a few passwords that way as
well um

295
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,830
/url right him

296
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,250
right and so for me it's a it's a
comfort level Ryan

297
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,820
I just don't trust their party so the
reason I host my own email has because

298
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,389
they don't trust other people to do it

299
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,399
um that I want to own and I want to keep
it in my possession all times

300
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,439
bomb is just my personal comfort level
obviously it

301
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,440
um lunch a lot of other folks will
definitely him

302
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,789
yes him

303
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,899
not it saves in his Majesty up with

304
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:18,459
with the description above where used it
on I don't show time step when I

305
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,529
generate it but

306
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:24,470
I am did I really what I've never had a
case where

307
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,510
interest but when I generate that
probably have an email from the counts

308
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,190
created

309
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,840
I am but I am it third

310
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,389
great right and so right now the form
that its in its more about

311
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:40,459
it's more to happen topple the webmail
system om I am planning to

312
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,620
to and how this into an actual plugin
that I can release

313
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,779
arm and so once I have that done

314
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,090
I am I'll I'll publish that also cd1

315
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,149
roundcube you can take this and install
it arm course it does require

316
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,949
if you want hosting this yourself that I
whoever your provider

317
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,610
is has two accept that and provide the
necessary privileges to your back-end

318
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,399
I held up star I to allow those
modifications

319
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:10,949
yes up

320
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,279
yes is im

321
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,940
so I do have that as well I am and that
produces

322
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,720
I do get a lot of other interesting
stuff that comes out because I C

323
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,279
and I haven't really understood why I
get this but I get a lot it now

324
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,250
that's 01 another to me that I have I
get a lot of email address to just

325
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,799
random characters I don't know why a lot
of them have Excel spreadsheet I'll be

326
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,168
enough

327
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,620
um but as these are things I've never
used before I don't know how I don't

328
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,768
have something came up with the bitches

329
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:43,299
random om and has allotted random you
know

330
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,658
number letter combinations at that
moment so

331
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:51,429
up just that's also a nuisance as well
um but the other interesting that I

332
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:55,580
have fun with this is that on you know
so far I've talked about some

333
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,610
outgoing um flow information so I'm
logging into a website

334
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,299
but there are cases where the you know
whoever I'm

335
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:07,210
it interacting with his contacting me so
case in point if I A

336
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,710
I'm if I providing my contact
information

337
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,250
you know phone email on both your home
South center

338
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,480
to say my credit card company and they
have a fraud alert

339
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,120
and that this has happened to me when
I'm traveling overseas the same email

340
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,699
built

341
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,870
trying call me and and so sometimes
sorry

342
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,110
I definitely don't get the calls arm and
saucy the it now

343
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,709
and so this is another way Council
validate that it wasn't because some of

344
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,519
these emails are

345
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,010
are if you just looking at the subject

346
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,940
and the from you know in the Summary do
look

347
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,860
fairly consistent fairly legitimate you
really have to open it up to

348
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,719
take a look so but allows me to very
quickly dismiss it because it wasn't

349
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,850
sent to the correct address

350
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,189
so its aren't and

351
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,379
you know for me it's pretty easy to spot
some others emails but

352
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:01,408
for other people that I for example my
life I've

353
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,480
can't use the system she can easily spot
if

354
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,889
it's a fraudulent on I just because
wasn't sent to the right address

355
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:11,309
yes who'll

356
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,570
yes in right and I haven't

357
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,510
I haven't worked on that yet but that
that is a good idea that something I

358
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,010
thought about this is basically
autocrine the rules to go along with

359
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,600
that sell

360
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,010
arm the the catch is identifying all the
potential to means

361
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,029
that might be coming in from I'm I
notice that some

362
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:32,870
places use job multiple domains and I
don't always

363
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:39,479
have them up too quickly him

364
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,250
right yeah I mean the zappa

365
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,350
now that it's out it's

366
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,510
its thats obsession as the things I
thought about on as well

367
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,710
adjuster um things happened and he gets
up

368
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:58,149
um so you know the seem like a really
good idea when it does this outcome

369
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,719
you know basic what i'm talking bout
yours is using your Login ID is

370
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,799
is keeping it secret right it's not it's
no longer public information and I'm

371
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,750
saying use your login ideas as another

372
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,769
a factor in your authentication that
that should be kept secret

373
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,820
right that you don't share it with
everyone and

374
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,080
um you know obviously cause at the same
rate on expect security fury user

375
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,820
passwords

376
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,490
om or your login ad's because I'll

377
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:28,149
if I can get hold of one account I
probably can't get ahold of other counts

378
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:32,119
on and I you know it's it's

379
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,020
this is just the way I've me if moving
out where the target so I put the

380
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,049
the featuring bulls there is that I you
know I'll

381
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,600
there's a lot of up what is the lot

382
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,129
a lot of people intimate scared because
you know best practices they cannot

383
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:48,760
follow everyone sedans and generally
accepted principles

384
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,350
and and sometimes maybe it's not a good
idea to follow what everyone else is

385
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,760
doing

386
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,240
they might wanna do your own thing om
and so

387
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,419
I can look at this is sorta getting I
was late and you

388
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,950
you know when somebody does get access
to one of these accounts

389
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,010
arm they're gonna look at it

390
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,320
probably spend minute you know profit
scripted I would imagine

391
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,820
on and they're gonna move on because
they're not going to find much value

392
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,908
added and there's easy targets

393
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:22,090
yes him

394
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,340
right

395
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,709
right he

396
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,580
his

397
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,678
min

398
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,500
so

399
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,690
melodic is dis and the Login ID

400
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:58,639
will just simply do these Rd portion up
the email just so I just business trip

401
00:23:58,639 --> 00:23:59,370
the domain of

402
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,658
and I use that as my login ID so there
there's something to that works

403
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:06,269
on because it at the end of the day rate

404
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:10,000
when you send a freak out they want an
email address the 1i login ID added

405
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,880
countries everyone's doesn't really I
don't see the reason today I thought

406
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,090
about it but I can find a good reason
why I should

407
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:23,090
rent

408
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,949
best thing

409
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,309
word be raised

410
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:36,408
what who I think you know where you're
going to live in a good

411
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:39,700
I do so so let let me

412
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,490
let me get my next slide because I think
that'll probably make this a little less

413
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,309
controversial

414
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:47,559
on you don't this is this works for me

415
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,879
I don't think it'll work for everyone
I'll you know

416
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,559
its it's just something that I i have
used as a tool to better protect me

417
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,580
I think some other people could use this
I can see this becoming a mainstream

418
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,000
offering to be %ah City bring arm

419
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,110
it requires a trust in for most people
scan the trustee third-party

420
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,418
news outlet renews gmail and that
becomes the points

421
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,580
over tax and because I want to get all
your cousins can go after that he now

422
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,939
on and so since I'm

423
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,450
not a big provider people all yet Akers
generally don't know me

424
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,809
made it now iomega have a lot more
interesting I

425
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:26,149
connections to my servers um but

426
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,080
the you know it it works for me because
I'm just sort of getting out the way in

427
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,189
and my hope is that on you know I'm not
prescribing

428
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,129
obscurity as a as a primary factor but
it's mean for me to get out of the way

429
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:40,250
and let somebody else you know take it

430
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,370
take the hit right you know some if I
mean in the woods

431
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,340
right and DC there right I don't have to
run the bear I just have to run every

432
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,639
you know just the the slowest person so

433
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,689
that's really what up my goal is up on

434
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,299
and really help protect myself

435
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:00,639
it certainly there some interesting
lessons learned I am

436
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:06,559
but om he I have to have to make that
sort of the mainstream i think thats

437
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,299
you know some folks will my deal tease
so

438
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:13,710
um but I was

439
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,120
all kinda let's get into the the big
question and now you can ask

440
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,918
I for im

441
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,129
router mine you

442
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:27,199
in

443
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,200
did

444
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,590
head

445
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,158
worst and credit card

446
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:52,159
min Social Security them

447
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,699
him we

448
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,440
his believed

449
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,519
head

450
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,289
used

451
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:15,309
I'm good

452
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,549
I'm %um

453
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:22,649
hmmm

454
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:25,809
and I stand and the difference is that

455
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,658
its I'm not entrusting the third party
22 Reine

456
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:32,760
invent uses things that were the ones I

457
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,330
it something I did myself as a means to
you have control over that so

458
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,559
if I have the option a giving you an
email address right

459
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,110
its its can be something that's not tied
to anything else I'll om

460
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,750
the whole point to this is really to on

461
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,610
protect myself and give me a means to
control there's a lot of information and

462
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,229
entertaining

463
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,639
and arm I need some way managing and
keeping it same

464
00:27:56,639 --> 00:28:01,350
so I agree that you know you never want
to take a system that's designed for

465
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,639
specific purpose in trying

466
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,740
reinvented in some fashion there really
was not designed for

467
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,769
arm but you know that all these a lot he
says where you are

468
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:13,289
I am signing up for counts they are
asking you for

469
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:16,809
an email address to login ID and you
know if you strictly

470
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,960
speaking from wannabes secure you can
give them their own unique combination

471
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,840
that would never

472
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,860
never is anywhere else and that's all
I'm seeking to enable

473
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,289
on and so yes it is a modification to
the system to

474
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,059
to enable that but its it's really all
I'm doing is

475
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,059
I you know adding alias and having a
means to track it now

476
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,428
for sites that I care about right

477
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:43,029
such a financial site I will still use a
very good passer and I'll keep in the

478
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,020
passer talk

479
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,049
absolute exercise you know good hygiene
but

480
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:50,230
I have over 400 accounts

481
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,039
the signed up for most of those I don't
care about

482
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,059
if you if you get my you know if you can
log into it and do something with that I

483
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,010
really could care less

484
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,220
because there's no financial harm to me
bomb

485
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,500
it at worse be like a mosquito bite okay
just you know kinda

486
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,070
clean up the counter that the move on I
don't have to go and change passwords

487
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,850
at all these other sites and it's really
just making is free because I don't

488
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,020
worry about yes there is a compromise in
sight that's great you know my password

489
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,110
I don't have to rush out change it
between us

490
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,500
and it's just its it's a buffer for me
that adds

491
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,580
some protection and as i said for works
well for me

492
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,449
he can work well for individuals om very
hard to apply

493
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,830
but I think the larger

494
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,980
our topic today you know the larger
thought I want to bring out %uh this is

495
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,289
that

496
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,770
you know since we are relying on these
unique identifiers right what is your

497
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,750
how do you identify yourself right is
you know how we generate

498
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,510
israeli's that really notes direction
least we should still be going at

499
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,809
because I'll its it's a critical
component and we made a public

500
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,110
maybe that isn't the right approach
maybe we need to think up a different

501
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,918
way identify yourselves uniquely

502
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,029
bomb such that it would not be
non-obvious and non

503
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:08,409
reusable yep

504
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:13,669
up i think i think im warming up to the
idea at least

505
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:16,990
I better

506
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:23,990
your people used

507
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,570
right old

508
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,668
mean

509
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:45,669
using Bay

510
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,678
means you our

511
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,960
used

512
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,200
right in for

513
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,200
hood weird

514
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,340
him

515
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,010
now it is here it's not worth it good

516
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,070
him were

517
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,909
usually women when

518
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,890
where min

519
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,690
good

520
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,240
heard as your on

521
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,440
sir im

522
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,070
said any yeah

523
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,210
Jan

524
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,400
mottos said

525
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,750
males wanted

526
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,010
I bracket there is there's a similar

527
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,000
rising phone number services while the
did the same thing on

528
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,580
band I am yeah I think

529
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,760
I you know i i what I was hoping to come
get out read

530
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,090
presenting this really was to to attend
a private discussion around

531
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,399
well how do you how can you you take
something this and make this more

532
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,120
applicable

533
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,989
Frank I think it's the user ID concept
that I'm looking to change

534
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,630
I don't have to change it this probably
what extent but there's probably

535
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,640
um some other means

536
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,650
I'll and a blue it would probably also
require participation from all these

537
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,900
sites that are Jeter you know generating
and storing account data

538
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,510
on but I think that the the notion using
he's ready

539
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,430
said just the of something that you put
up for public Tom

540
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,360
you know made it may be that time is I
has passed

541
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,760
meeting with something yes cited

542
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,140
for one was for this item

543
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,520
a.m. min up cycle

544
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,290
that him

545
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,570
for the most part I generally keep the
same once had given them

546
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,230
an email address our keep it unless I
have reason to think I should change it

547
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,740
on which I have done on occasion I am on
especially when

548
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,780
I'm I accounts are to get spammed

549
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,420
I just don't deal with it but the you
know it

550
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,060
its your login ID is affected they treat
it as public

551
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,120
right its it's just out there it's not
stored in

552
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,300
any in a secure manner so I'll treat it
like that

553
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,450
I am but I am

554
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,460
its it's just so is I

555
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,850
I just use it personally I just use it
to you know

556
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,209
allow me to make it disappear basically
like the paper napkin site

557
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,400
I you know once I decided that I don't
want it anymore idol EP removes the

558
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,730
lease from held up store

559
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:58,300
and it's gone anything goes that bounces
good

560
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,110
crawled

561
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,010
measured

562
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:11,110
writer board

563
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,750
them

564
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,929
more

565
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,199
your

566
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:26,120
right um so I i havent I haven't dug
into the statistics on how much damage

567
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,659
tied to some of these random

568
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,830
counts om me one word generally

569
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,920
like the one factor right but that's
that's me deliberately giving out my

570
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,889
information is posted well I'm signing
for rent something very specific I

571
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,730
signed up to you

572
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,429
cost to get access to a form I want to
post message:

573
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,790
right I and then some East older you
know the the count database for that

574
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,250
site

575
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,400
arm and then they're using it right he's
in other ways common then she probably

576
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,679
get sleet and some research using it for
spam

577
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,430
on you know I'd I don't have good

578
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,569
I have dug into you know how many those
are come because a lot of times

579
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,040
om months I hear about that I will go in

580
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,810
change the No Jets politic ounce can
move on armed as religious comes onto

581
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,750
it's a little bit about me being lazy
and that I don't necessarily always have

582
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,890
time to go through my email so I see a
notice from the site saying hey we've

583
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,890
been compromised everyone's change your
passwords

584
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,100
I will go in and change by counter the
same time

585
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,170
I'm you know the the the I email address
and I can try and change the login ID as

586
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:27,680
well

587
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,819
on but com for the most part

588
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,460
I said the majority of those Elise that
have phone to the bucket

589
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,910
I really could care less about them
because they they're going to be sites

590
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,109
for I wanted to do

591
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,440
download something and I had to give
them an email address to a former

592
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,170
something that

593
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,230
I don't care I just have I have that
really

594
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,400
simple plain password that I'm sure is
in a dictionary

595
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,460
but I N that's okay I'm accepted the
risk that

596
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,540
om and then I haven't sort of next
buckingham where

597
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,190
I I do conduct transactions i buy things
but I don't give

598
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,480
at on them store information so i'd
Nereus

599
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,530
a strong password there but as always
many strong pasternak s

600
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,860
in and then everything that

601
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,080
can really harming I probably separate
them

602
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,960
yes is available he said

603
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,190
see the mini marred

604
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:33,750
thank you for up

605
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,610
well

606
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:44,320

607
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400

608
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,400
min

609
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,509
yeah

610
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,770
it right it this is this is just an
enhancement to other good hygiene

611
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,530
practices

612
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,270
really its you know we always at I
always hear people saying also notes and

613
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,660
a good trip securities and onion

614
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,870
idea many layers to this this is it not
8

615
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,000
to it was not till it's affected by
itself it's it's on the effective in

616
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,080
conjunction with others and

617
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,870
again I just when I run the bear so are
on the other person is

618
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:26,339
you know he just by the bear yep

619
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:33,340
min

620
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,630
up

621
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:44,030
right

622
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,050
I mean in in generate with credit cards
here

623
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,320
you have problem your you're exempt from
liability rates although assume if you

624
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,970
identify the fraudulent charges so

625
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,120
um I don't worry as much about that
anymore because

626
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,460
you know you call them I can say that I
didn't this wasn't me

627
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,650
ok cancel the card to remove the charges
its five minutes my time it's done

628
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,750
Exeter change your

629
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,720
exactly right are goes on

630
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,700
I greeted

631
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,939
print

632
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,410
and and that's where the arm the control
pin numbers

633
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,690
I thought really would have been up good
solution for the industry arm

634
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,200
and its kinda surprising that that's
never really gotten a lot of adoption we

635
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,779
can just say

636
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,740
I'm gonna generate a card is good for a
year it I can set a height limit as to

637
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,629
how much can

638
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,970
you know to be spent over the lifetime
in the cart and I use it with one

639
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,520
merchant

640
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,500
so great it gets stoned though the only
risk there is that if something breaks

641
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,090
in the merchant and orders more

642
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,770
so from that merchant and changes your
address right on

643
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,450
but it did you then you know if you have
any compromise well again you've given

644
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,069
everyone a unique credit card number

645
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,590
and I just have to change the one so

646
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,880
there are still companies that up you
know there so financial companies that

647
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,950
do provide that

648
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,160
I think Citibank me might still do that
on

649
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,009
but its you can have to dig around to
find it I'm

650
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,170
South yes

651
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,610
here's did

652
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,530
euros they're trying

653
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,660
hi or more together your nightmares

654
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,299
area that workers right

655
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,730
run its areas where comp

656
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,720
predator I mean SE now I'm because the
you know its first credit they they

657
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,410
always go after your social and

658
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,700
on and you know they generally

659
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,230
the I guess from a background check

660
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,990
perspective maybe that might cause some
interesting results on

661
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,580
you know I've I've had a over over there
I

662
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,660
you know course of my career had a few
background checks when you know

663
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,149
joining a company in I on assessing all
the services are kinda

664
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,740
with the timing and I remember %ah one

665
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,060
employer hired a company to do
background check on me in you know I had

666
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,690
doesn't start up so they called me

667
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,650
to check on my unemployment from
start-up so and a lot facing those

668
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,170
animate and I think people with the

669
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,590
employers do as well it's more about the
just

670
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,900
you know did commit Sony crankbaits
wanna know that

671
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,340
sup another question

672
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:34,340
100

673
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,169
standard

674
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,330
hud

675
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:48,590
mid

676
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,790
cited

677
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,370
needed

678
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,509
yeah i DK pictures if if you had a

679
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,810
annealing said Beatrice did meet I know
a lot people are have been

680
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,529
looking at this over the years right
there's there's than time tools out

681
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,240
there right for

682
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,339
detecting spam in and they work to some
degree or another but there

683
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,040
you know undoubtedly will all to myself
that was my

684
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,340
you know originally yes I want trauma
spam but

685
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,400
I think I you know kind with attorney
Angeles just

686
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,020
I don't have to deal with changing
passwords and it's just me trying to

687
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,150
%uh not getting the same you know a

688
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,180
not be in that crowd in on running with
everyone else and that

689
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,680
you know and undoubtedly a healthy
people get picked off right

690
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,560
yep

691
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Road

692
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,680
guess red

693
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,140
I could

694
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,509
but I i can go from the assumption that
the yeah maybe mansion like it

695
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,100
compromised and if it doesn't I keep
that is the store then somebody could

696
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,259
potential walk off with satin you actual
treat the data so

697
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,320
if I E you know if I'm honest

698
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,200
think about this from a more pure my
perspective I keep it on a I am

699
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,339
and the USB stick it's only accessible
on the plug the steak n

700
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:27,340
it's just different model up

701
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,850
yep so its

702
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,460
it's in cryptid I mean I use out the
hard way restricting token with the self

703
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,460
destruct Reacher

704
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,280
so 10

705
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,350
wrong in trees in a row in that that
device to sources of

706
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:49,180
mid correct

707
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,950
broad

708
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,500
it yessir

709
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,050
so is so I use the password manager but
again the database is kept on the USB

710
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,200
stick

711
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,169
so and said using the keychain right
type to use an application

712
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,850
on for better forces that the Password
Safe

713
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,110
a which is reasonably well on it may not
be the best

714
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,310
anymore I don't know this is something
I've been used for many years

715
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:21,350
I and I figure I have another other
controls in place that

716
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,290
sorry if there is a issue with that the
nose I've made it sufficiently difficult

717
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,830
rate if you know the if someone wants to
specifically target me odds are they

718
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,299
probably can

719
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,610
you know I breakthrough my defenses but
they're not

720
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,840
usually started you specifically they're
trying to go for mass grabbed

721
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,530
information I so the government is going
to target me I'm going to be

722
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:50,530
you know victimized by the government
and that's just something except

723
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,640
cool I'll thank you its

724
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:57,890
me
