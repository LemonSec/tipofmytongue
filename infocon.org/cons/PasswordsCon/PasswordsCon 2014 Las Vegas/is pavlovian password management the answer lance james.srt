right now you have arm sorry

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,160
a lane change talking about there is
Pablo in password and management the

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,669
answer

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,110
um should be about the thirty-minute

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,589
talk and probably have time at the end
for questions

12
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,940
or discussion for discussion who

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,510
I A everybody I was already got around
the room my name is where it's at our

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,239
model

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,449
wat get their butts I well

16
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,780
mainland some or all of the hall its
also cheers everyone

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,699
I'll so this stays in this room

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,470
know on the way issue here but I came up
with this idea what a cute pets

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,979
you on I was thinking russians so and
next you know what I don't even feel

20
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:11,220
about passwords okay

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,550
you know so small things but I do deal
arm

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,550
with up that's better me I'll so
basically I do it like Cyber

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,630
Intelligence at the way

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,500
which you know I love you click link but
you know we are getting better and

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,900
getting into the cyberspace pretty
heavily and so

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,600
when things that I you out there was a
lot of the actual psychological side it

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,798
not just you know the
counterintelligence from the computer

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,780
with Russia the mean right that's just

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,640
literally land airspace see and cyber
isn't getting it makes more complex than

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,840
in some senses but

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,390
lot ideals a psychological but strategy
thinking how people work

32
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,640
cognitive ability so we have a section
in our department Rd

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,610
Martin that focuses around you know
kinda what we call mines it's coming you

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,259
know psychological perspectives inside
the actual work with you right how does

35
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,649
our adversary think that

36
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,979
but then I realized you know what are
the biggest problems that we have today

37
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:01,789
in security is you know we have the
security versus convenience

38
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,590
models we have all these interesting
thing marketing meet you know the

39
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,860
battles between marking the ironic part
is marking you found a way to use your

40
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,299
research and that's when you find things
like 81 reports things lying around but

41
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:17,470
basically you week we we've been kinda
running against it and we we spent time

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,709
calling you know at work inside
environment corporate he

43
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,720
partner whatever at you know assuming
the user's Inc

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,739
but that kinda like saying a race car
driver is assuming normal car drivers

45
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,140
think right like where computer ECM you
know experts as they would call us know

46
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,099
but I'm but the demand in the business
today is me about like being a expert on

47
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:37,590
that their

48
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,930
it's just a plaque on the need to use
your business right and

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,670
ironically I saw something that's funny
was like I'll the summer rush it was

50
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,619
like the weight like

51
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,720
change apaches early you know kato beat
the summer rush I wish it was really

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,400
funny so much on your only one with
that's really about like there's a

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,510
summer rusher password

54
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,700
you its others liked okay I'm gonna go
out there and I was actually going to

55
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,000
get those things as a fish

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,180
because it's kinda it made me want to
like this something right now if you

57
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,000
notice look at fishing my back in
ripley's and fishing and stuff

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,590
is that exploitation incentive or fear
or moving

59
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,280
people endure you're having the human
yearly rate right so

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,239
you're running heard about that was the
summer us really kinda does prevent the

61
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,360
IT department getting the same day all
these calls with them screwing up when

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,720
they actually like putting your password
so it actually saves from attorney calls

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,390
if you beat the summer I'll

64
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,700
but not the actual it was a pretty
intelligent some ways I'm it was kinda

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,140
weird

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,798
at first but then realize action that
could minimize or get people to come to

67
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,430
move right

68
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,190
so I'm something I gotta go into this
like this

69
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,370
idea hit me a while back in even though
I call a Pavlovian password manager

70
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,230
protocol

71
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,010
rate which I really just call it that
didn't sound sexy arm

72
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,620
and we need a 4-letter acronym for some
time apart alright so

73
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,129
when things are really is actually Scott
opportunity conditioning so it's

74
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,399
difference between classical
conditioning an offer

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,349
mission which is BS in his workers I'm
have lost but actually the game

76
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,750
application is actually getting people
do the idea

77
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,370
does beat with the the classical
condition cuz you're neutralization

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,790
the neutral idea is how we are to treat
our passports today how we deal with

79
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,079
this

80
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,120
we become kinda in a trance just dealing
with this stuff and so I started looking

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,260
at realizing that the actual a classical
part is we do want our users to salivate

82
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,890
when choosing a good past greats so that
part is pavlovian

83
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,060
but the actual technique really is
actually with operant conditioning

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,340
I is image from a BF Skinner's work
pigeons missiles and things like that

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,489
okay cool so he's a behavioral analyst
companies up a table scientist Riesling

86
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,830
right

87
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,270
that probably one for most names in
behavior science

88
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,299
operation coming up with us up but it's
really cannot think it parents in your

89
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,700
you think parents measure okay so you
know about the punishment reward systems

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,020
right I'll guilt complex in the negative
concept to modify behavior

91
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,310
you know so basically our mission comes
on TV

92
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,190
categories reinforcement honest the week
to increase behavior

93
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,760
you want to reinforce thats father what
I I'm a manager or

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,190
and I i but you know mentored other
people trying to teach the management

95
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,510
skills and sometimes I'll just focus on
the bottom line in

96
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,779
focus on the things that they didn't you
write an unlikely for got to reward them

97
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,979
you know let them know the things they
did really well because when it comes on

98
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,570
the bottom line is people follow you
anywhere if they actually feel like they

99
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,120
also

100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,370
get that rewards right so these things
are important and

101
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,450
soft skills what we call it in the
corporate world right

102
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,610
no elsa punishment decreasing behavior
right so on both sides were positive and

103
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,010
negative rightly II

104
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,770
at a stimulus of following correct
behavior someone to train a dog or a cat

105
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,969
dog a treat

106
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,099
you know ever negative which is
basically we are we are

107
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,409
negative reinforcement is basically to
remove I austin let's not once its

108
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,550
some sense right now that the concept
here that i'm gonna be talking about

109
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,599
more focus on the positive because the
idea and missus be spending time

110
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,789
punishing our users for a long time and
just telling them what do I think one of

111
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,789
the biggest things is the also in this
concept you want to the user

112
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,360
you have control their own fate right
the more people thought like

113
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,830
you know that I you'd be surprised how
many users are people world wanna learn

114
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,880
stuff

115
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,310
right and so I think that that's 10
things been exploring some

116
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,399
if you sit down with someone you
actually realize hey action wanna know

117
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,750
more about information like this

118
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,950
now fight pick up I could slow down
enough to teach them this up my

119
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,700
my speech I think that actually like oh
hey this is actually interesting right

120
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,409
some a punishment I we have is you have
the positive and negative as well

121
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,880
I what we had a noxious stimulus you
know following behavior:

122
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,409
the positive a spanking a child or
whatever was probably got there but you

123
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:29,649
know there's the example

124
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:33,330
I'll and the negative obviously removing
something so my parents when I get this

125
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,529
behaviour big

126
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:37,719
I practiced violin all the time when I
was young I love the very sleepy then

127
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,890
case right there in

128
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,649
if i misbehave they took it away him
have a mis-trial migrate cell

129
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,610
um so you know we're gonna we're gonna
really talk about the positive side to

130
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,640
both reinforcement

131
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,479
honey right so we're not gonna actually
really focus on the negative for taking

132
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,060
them away

133
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,209
we're gonna give it all to the right Inc
so you hear some examples are actually

134
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,169
doable

135
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:00,649
child completing homework the results
are more right you know

136
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,010
I employees finishing project your
praise from your boss mad at you get a

137
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,399
bonus a long-term award you know things
like that

138
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,930
are you gonna get a lot like wow this is
this rock you guys did a great job right

139
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,950
you may get eminence you make it you
know you'll see that reward right

140
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,959
if you ever give up I'll the child not
completing homework obviously results in

141
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,740
a public much rather take something away

142
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,099
their Xboxes 3i their act like one
another or whatever

143
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,180
which by the way parents is a really
good idea gets tricked my guys I

144
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,570
and in so employees opposition parties
obviously can cause detachment

145
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,060
in a bonus a performance review possibly
getting fired you know

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,760
I so obviously these are real basic
right

147
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,880
so we're going to get reinforcement
punishment but on the positive side so I

148
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,270
was

149
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,149
is near the psychology low like me live
in this where hackers types right

150
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,659
and you know the times you just can't go
to bed you can't sleep because you're in

151
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,070
the motor coating you're doing

152
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,500
you know whatever you like and I unit
unhelpfully sometimes teach you all

153
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,370
night

154
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,000
but you got something going you get this
flow and it's another that has this

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,839
balance and challenging Jones in your
own still set so that you get to

156
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,519
learning point right

157
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,580
but it also has this thing where it's
not frustrating you can't get there

158
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,070
right cell so in that that gaming
concept ruin that in psychology closes

159
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,560
the intrinsic motivation the kids that

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,000
up you example is Dean's video games
related can't get off me

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,779
because it actually uses flow is a
certain set a challenge for certain

162
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:21,599
things good example

163
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,149
total one into the reason why was unique
is the way they actually came by that

164
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:25,959
game

165
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,029
right so that's like all your clothes
what's really interesting to have a look

166
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,110
at flow like there's a weepy article on

167
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,890
psychology cloning actually bass on

168
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,360
I we look at are you know this is all
for the positive reinforcement to add a

169
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,140
game to the passwords that needs these
games can go as far as you know

170
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,899
badges or whatever or in a contest sir
or things like that I even have the idea

171
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,399
like if you wanna like report phishing

172
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,640
in game by that kinda stuff goes
attributes loyal metzner

173
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,199
but I'll I her but we also positive
positive punishment

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm realizing that if you let the the
person choose their fate

175
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,880
but you say this the Peter gonna happen
you have a consequence in action a

176
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,730
consequence isn't always bad a
consequence just the result to the

177
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,500
action right

178
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,470
you say the consequence is I i'm gonna
choose a weak password or gunnery have

179
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,230
you reset

180
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,960
every three decks gonna let you know
that when I'm gonna battery would say

181
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,640
okay

182
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,960
it'll be worse every three days after
all the cognitive load in the cost that

183
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,680
that

184
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,459
to the user is gonna go mean a better
pay attention for a second I think ima

185
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,770
read how this works

186
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,699
it coming when people get behind a car
and they put their pee in a car and

187
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,310
they're in a trance not realizing the
driving three thousand pound vehicle

188
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,239
that could kill them if they're not
paying attention

189
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,230
right but we don't really have that
inducted anymore just gotten used to

190
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,550
take things for granted

191
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,150
one thing with our security industry
right now even though its hollywood in

192
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,300
cyber everything hot were still kinda
stuck there so

193
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,939
since the industries decided the people
problem upgrade tickets the level the

194
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,950
vehicle right

195
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,040
so we can actually like looking give
them positive punishment that 100

196
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,810
low-cost

197
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,859
higher right in which will enforce

198
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,030
in re in you know goes back to report
that enforces that's actually have a

199
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,050
cognitive awareness when actually
learning about

200
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,280
the final able to tell you know tell
them by suggesting versus going you're

201
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,180
gonna do this

202
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,140
but most other cites a casino is known
to the password stuff right anyways

203
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
so we're gonna finally encourage them to
learn about how to do it

204
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,380
and they're going to finally meet like
taking the security series right on

205
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:13,920
their own

206
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,560
right now given up our right on it's a
trade-off right so we show them trust

207
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,369
her what's

208
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,840
right and they become dependent on the
information instead of us right this

209
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,180
also lower the number phone calls in a
row

210
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,489
so something so in this is %uh this
spearmint right

211
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,050
where we're not here to say this is
Eunice solve all problems

212
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,729
right it's an idea that he was gonna
Batman series it's gotta be mister

213
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,610
right so designed to measure results
samples right so we want to actually

214
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,820
take this making the spirit and use it
in

215
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,220
and enterprise environment don't think
gmail so that's up his email never do it

216
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,840
because they'll

217
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,300
feel like it desensitizes people come to
Gmail even a two-factor authentication

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,170
the

219
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,000
much difference but I but we look at
like enterprise important internal

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,550
places that we run a test on them they
also I can you see the fish in it s the

221
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,910
check the fishing and

222
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,120
things like that in turn right we're
gonna assume good password storage and

223
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,310
when I say capacitors today we don't use
to pass a surgeon-general

224
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,579
anybody heard about Sharpie secure
remote password zero-knowledge proof

225
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,710
I when I actually posted this on a blog
on an argument so we can prove or

226
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,270
something like that what you are going
to find a field is not

227
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,439
group forcible that's not how it works

228
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,210
it it's not a thing that's copulas title
the tax rate so

229
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,840
but it's not in the same way is that
where you still we don't have the tools

230
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,320
that are readily available and it's
quite the

231
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,500
right so I'm but there are ways to
implement properly right you're not

232
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,210
sharing secrets you can actually have
some what about what strength there

233
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,480
right now we're gonna assume the past
security

234
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,850
whether it's hashes SAP's but we have
salt gonna do the proper thing we're

235
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,450
gonna sing

236
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,560
right so details to users are provided

237
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,569
on meaning we're gonna teach them we're
gonna let them have actual

238
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,360
understand so we're not hiding it from
them explaining how the pastor is work

239
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
this is a good idea

240
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,420
ought to let them have it wants you know
and support and help make sure if they

241
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,490
don't understand something we

242
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,330
very much offer them an area what what
is a past great house is measured things

243
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,070
like that let's stop assuming you
thirsty

244
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,580
right um lower bounds are decided upon
prior so the sea so will not allow

245
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,440
no password or they can set up some you
know you can set stated was of

246
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,520
right um so

247
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,460
look it up after payment schedule this
is just the high high level one that

248
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,700
actually come up with

249
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,290
don't think about it is actual direct
measurement again strongly in

250
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,209
and strength password is not like
because the linear issue can't really go

251
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,210
because that one change can be
everything is going strong

252
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,700
based on this populations so we're going
to look at it as we're gonna put them in

253
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,650
septet agrees it's a weak password balls
and bats satin that

254
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,010
on expiration three days meetings to me
it's strong at sixty days

255
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,910
it was passed praise ninety days now the
funniest things I've worked on this this

256
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,040
morning I had a demo

257
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,730
and actually the demo II blah thanks for
some people to help me to get stung

258
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,340
their busy schedule with his

259
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,770
need they did an amazing job I'll cool
part about it was i felt quite myself

260
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,390
a challenge me and I wanted to get a
five star rating pass from a fast-paced

261
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,560
soco um the probable and I would you
know

262
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,959
always list the body help on this the
talking to Austin a few other people

263
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,340
that like you know maybe we can build up
a model that does

264
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,420
is an experiment and measures you think
right so maybe someone in Owens

265
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,180
wins when the site also can help an
authentication model things like that

266
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,420
this is obviously a lot of the stuff is
eighty Active Directory things like that

267
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,300
held up

268
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,779
I'll Inc we want to look at metrics rate
we're here to measure measures were not

269
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,460
here to say this idea works

270
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,490
we want to learn that works right so
we'll Anderson percent of initial me

271
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,060
effort past right so um in that sense

272
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,430
we want to see how many people do not
pretty much this does not work

273
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,260
right how many times they gonna go
through before they actually like the

274
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,020
site and see if that they may never

275
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,350
this might actually gives an idea what
kinda personally pipes or or

276
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,970
how people look at a positive and
reinforcement you remember peoples

277
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,200
reports there's an ever-growing

278
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,390
up can be skewed think they've been
studies and kids have been ritalin for

279
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,170
like like 20 years while they were
growing up

280
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,240
actually message the reward system so
you never know what medicines they're on

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
there were no other reason is that we
might actually get a very up

282
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,610
I interesting inductive reasoning of the
shouldn't have any

283
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,710
are also percentage of initial secure
passwords I

284
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,070
that just start out like people already
are are there so we can imagine our

285
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,210
sample that as well

286
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,339
many people already kinda got the
message along time ago right

287
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,750
I'll success change over time and over
like

288
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,450
then see how many people change or gonna
get ice amassed change over time really

289
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,700
quickly here we gotta get my kind of
like a trickle

290
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,990
right so we're measure that gonna the
failure rate me the minimum deviation at

291
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,050
least effort over time

292
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,680
so you know this could actually do with
something with where people are just not

293
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,079
incentivizing job in general might
actually

294
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,640
you know give us insight something else
you never know it could be completely

295
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,460
relating this big things we can start

296
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,610
right and then to success rate how well
did this thing to overtime museum

297
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,180
percent increase that was actions
Southland

298
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,420
I in you know what that nationwide so I
wanna keep more right yes this less

299
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,540
you know if you guys have some I I want
to open up the discussion

300
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,439
obdurate now we can actually do it later
if they have a demo actually showing so

301
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm gonna

302
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,130
the hacked at DEMO not you know I'm but
it kinda gives you a call like

303
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,920
setup I have to thank you you people for
this but I was actually really need to

304
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,829
make sure much

305
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,100
one the conventions

306
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,830
i right long very what

307
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,150
you company the oval

308
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,279
what we're waiting as they really have
any ideas on the exterior lester things

309
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,010
measure

310
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,600
while

311
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,600
the sarcos make its in

312
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,199
right

313
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,140
yes Richard actually I was actually
really good health at that on that list

314
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,390
me

315
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,590
how do I get up your way to the

316
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,980
the the

317
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,779
okay you

318
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,269
other who I'm so I'll

319
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:09,260
thats were also we want to actually talk
about their and is obviously

320
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,010
should we prohibit them obviously we
want to and we can build a game cases

321
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,600
include that concept right

322
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,779
so for instance and Active Directory
alone if you set up your

323
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,480
your you know the password policy
correctly will let you can have

324
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,399
literally

325
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,829
related matter that's right so let's
begin go back to the something that we

326
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,279
still have certain rules that are in
place

327
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,730
right so we want to discourage Jim the
long-term goals get them start using

328
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,110
past breezes general

329
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,110
rights that you

330
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,210
the

331
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,810
so how do you check this track basically
or

332
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:56,569
not sir you

333
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,709
crack right

334
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:05,559
me in this is an experiment we may cheat
on what you're doing right we may want

335
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,319
to know the actual said dat we don't
want to use this is actual

336
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,520
enterprise-level like set up we want to
see the experiment first

337
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,879
right so this experiments designed
actually get people to start thinking

338
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,110
about and maybe we get them there and
then when we applied across the

339
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,780
enterprise

340
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,410
environment each not not not cheap but
well maybe we actually do you know what

341
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,260
that password is

342
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,740
or we run it through injury and see if
there's a edit this inservice

343
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,130
a have the %eh right so I think on
experience I we have to break some

344
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,070
security rules more the experiment
itself

345
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,879
right way it's not supposed to be this
like we're setting this up to be a

346
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,840
secure environment for using your
corporate

347
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,909
it's actually designed to get people to
get this study

348
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:47,200
the sea study actually that means you
would

349
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,980
arm engine in

350
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,679
no actually because after that we can
still at policies there i mean there is

351
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,580
ways that obvious

352
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,580
eighty in the back and picked up the
ante and a very it's right so whatever

353
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,220
that is I

354
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,330
shut my national what causes that what

355
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,809
well right

356
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:12,080
director okay so it is certainly this
week but look why those policies

357
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,730
backing though %uh start

358
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,120
i've seen that yet

359
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,270
actually read the way to de France so I
myself

360
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,600
are you everly past um don't we all

361
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I'm turning sexy its you

362
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,149
that there we go they were little I got
like

363
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,549
eating okay so we have normal user Joe
your

364
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,870
his password is that's it for now with
them

365
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,330
so um what this let

366
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,918
that's a so this is a mock-up like a
standard yes we're hearing that weapons

367
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,860
matter what but we haven't changed
passes artsy have a current password

368
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,949
your new password on your property right
on over here we have changed pasa

369
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,179
enter new password for your or out we
highly recommend

370
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,280
created unique path one that does not
mean another web site

371
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,309
I know you can't use your old password
was changed

372
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,799
10 so the standard you know set up there
are you

373
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,110
so I'm actually type in password I you

374
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,189
meaning lane password and this is not a
as the demo setup so it's not her

375
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,700
the rules are what I would prefer
reserve that we need to get nasa

376
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,330
be a lame password just like a lower
case huh

377
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,590
court alright court havoc already you I
O P right

378
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,918
iraq already everybody think that's good
because it's long and stop this

379
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,150
you know 64-bit technically I'll with a

380
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,210
style now according as I hit enter here

381
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,190
i cnt start to get I mean change with us
Abu

382
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,880
no and so it's it's earning ago
certainly there are about one half hour

383
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,179
but

384
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,169
we've all seen that before so I go ahead
and change my password and it says your

385
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,580
pastor with a satin expire in three days

386
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,090
right so this is like you know basic
concept here you know what happened this

387
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,030
morning was funny as those trying the
demo out checking all the bugs me sure

388
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,549
was working and then it caught me in in
like

389
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:12,510
10 hits like I stars I can I actually
started like us or something

390
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,770
I got three stars Naomi you're forced to
what the heck is the rule to get in five

391
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,299
Star Trek is actually my friends

392
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,730
help me make demo so they set up some
other rules and it's funny things that I

393
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,460
was like after a while I was like I was
the something you know with maybe a are

394
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,990
41 234 I 41 23

395
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,590
what we right you that

396
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,209
working 134 I

397
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,690
court he on the or a

398
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,690
I hate that it two stars I'll cool yes

399
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,299
right I right so after a while like what
the heck do I gotta do

400
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:51,510
and so I built was a star chart yet you
know the kids would get like a star on

401
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,179
the border with

402
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:56,799
what's and I think the so month early
work is in this case this is set rules

403
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,840
you would create your own rules thats

404
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,000
on these are not valid you not like
nobody's

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,750
10 the lower end up at the stars lower
and uppercase

406
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,240
restart Lord uppercase National Guard or
star Laura a

407
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,100
you know five stars all character
typable Great Lakes a greater than pols

408
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,418
the one star three days to date start
cooking three starts thirty days four

409
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:17,480
star sixty days

410
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,280
5 stars19 so actually got it fool me I
actually was got the challenge now like

411
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,809
I want to Brians by starr

412
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,730
so I am like my gosh I got caught by the
owner your idea itself and it actually

413
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,250
did

414
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,010
the challenge peace good thing you see
is very bit late an offense which

415
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,850
I think stars actually affect people
because her childhood or something

416
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,040
because it really does actually worked
in

417
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,090
it so I rather buy even like Mike might
my fiance and she's like

418
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,189
I actually wanted to get a five starts
to write so why I

419
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,600
that we actually made this big tits
morning I want to have a thing how do I

420
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,709
get the five-star Cedar Court learn more

421
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,390
but we actually like how I get to by
stars you're kinda enabling back in the

422
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,440
haitian how do I get there you know
think that

423
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,530
so finally using my fiance's

424
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,899
name with the combination of things I
was like lucky to

425
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,120
ass and I think I got it

426
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,050
%uh you're right and I'll

427
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,110
jacks right so I finally changed my
password

428
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,389
Agosto get ninety days in a mosque also
that demo

429
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,409
I'll go back to you the actual

430
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:22,500
the like that

431
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,500
so it's the questions ideas things like
that please

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,280
wrecked just all

433
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,309
what

434
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:53,309
wall we'll

435
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:01,179
while

436
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,870
rate so so the group the problem is now
you're managing more than one two three

437
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,668
and I actually like

438
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:15,080
the partially the idea I mean I you know
were so stuck in the InfoSec you tell a

439
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,860
return pass

440
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,178
so I'm gonna have to break my mindset to
a little bit so

441
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,460
I'm but I realize that the problem with
that is that you can go back to the risk

442
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,250
management issues why APT 1

443
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,179
the APT's getting a freakin network is
because we don't you risk management

444
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,950
issues you know we we allow these

445
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,290
lower-risk assets to accessing the
laterally into things like that

446
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,678
so the problem is that that does put
incentive is Asian back to the IT

447
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,100
department too and maybe we actually
drive something on both sides

448
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,158
right there's responsibility both sides
actually put liability in both hands

449
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,460
accountability everybody's gotta find
the right so actually i i think thats it

450
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,090
something worth further discussion

451
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,120
I'll

452
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,120
krecko right

453
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,340
but yeah I mean I think this is
something that's definitely hundreds in

454
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:17,340
pl7 opinion on that

455
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,190
the you

456
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,950
I think that Taylor we meet strong
passwords for the personal

457
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,179
identification

458
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,740
but then we need to switch to an
automated system that will provide a

459
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,990
strong passwords that is

460
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,350
really it up I'll I one going to

461
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,949
how random he is but it is complex yet
okay

462
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,490
and its strong and it's not it's not
been choosen

463
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,530
may yurman yet and just to switch the
context or just to provide or two

464
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,090
proxies a connection

465
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,840
or two whatever the way that they
architecture in the

466
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,870
network is setup but not to enable

467
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,290
strong passwords being chosen too
sensitive assets to be chosen by human

468
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,030
beings

469
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,178
yeah and I think in corporate
environment that's actually somewhat

470
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:24,429
more common the

471
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:29,220
yeah in a lot of violence I know that
they pasa generators problem

472
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,720
yet come along the same line to be
interesting to say I'm doing after four

473
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,560
stars if you're picking your own being
at 5 stars if you let the machine do it

474
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,300
for you

475
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,639
and ago doesn't know has a paper he's
doing at the USENIX

476
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,280
I in a couple weeks on how to memorize
passwords and urs best repetition

477
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,908
training habits that memorization

478
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:49,280
and so kinda turning that in Iraq
recognizing that it is a game but it's

479
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,129
longer than just a thirty seconds during
this window when you're setting up the

480
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:52,709
password

481
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,730
you should read as a loaner purpose and
the other the other servants and a BMI

482
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,139
provide there is I'm

483
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,330
extra features that you can access
spread if there are more things you can

484
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,830
do with the counter your thing I'm at a
topless the better passer people get

485
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,100
like that better future

486
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,449
or admin axles the at you can

487
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,179
affectively so it in the theme of humans
can't remember passwords

488
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,870
and it's my opinion the wish in Austin
till because we have machines for that

489
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,139
and you couldn't affected the required
to someone to use a password manager by

490
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:23,639
saying a possible it's gonna be 200
characters long

491
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:26,990
I can contain any what's the password
manager honestly I've actually seen it

492
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,379
work

493
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,860
commonly used by a lot more people is
and on both on their mobile

494
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,620
and their desktop and and then you you
know a system like this container you

495
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,050
only get the fifth star if he is a
possible manager

496
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,340
and you without needing to understand
the technology a deposit manager you

497
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,918
just make the password requirement

498
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,510
completely unreasonable great and then
someone has his apartment manager for

499
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,330
the South that is about passwords

500
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,730
say I think it's about getting them
where we want to be. right like it and

501
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,530
so I think we all agree on that that its

502
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,190
we can modify this chooses how everyone
this the cool thing as me in public bill

503
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,990
templates for this

504
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,870
like a pan module for the experiments L
so that we can try different things and

505
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,120
see how the successes

506
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,889
not I think really comes down to a good
training module also treating humans

507
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,949
about that but that but you know it's
its what its

508
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,070
those so I really like the idea I think
this is great eleven people just kinda

509
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,790
test

510
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,190
test the boundaries and say we we have
always done it right let's try something

511
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,929
new

512
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,760
um in in like that what's what's the
next step taxi doing something like this

513
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,250
on a larger scale

514
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,460
well I for all you guys to contact me
and see if we can put like working group

515
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,990
maybe have fun with this many

516
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,960
actually brings an accutane unit that
working electrodes paper about the

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,570
memorization

518
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,490
I did not foresee this being by itself I
think it's going to come with the

519
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,240
memorization concepts and more

520
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,110
meet you and stuff Stanford was working
on I and we start kinda looking at like

521
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,928
this problem at a higher level on
startup like staring at the end

522
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,620
in all the other stuff we've got that
thoughts all now it's getting the human

523
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,629
to understand

524
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:53,389
sadness I think dime for every like
anybody was the lie contact me

525
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:57,139
I give my contact shields up you that so
I

526
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:00,840
many thanks to this guy he won't was on
his name billion extends his wife did

527
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,260
actually the design for the actual demo
like the actual

528
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,360
thought that was actually awesome
Michelle Aurelio and Tom he didn't feel

529
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,790
that you help me in structure get all
the senate races morning that was

530
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,559
awesome

531
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,710
on your thoughts on that so I'll

532

but yeah so did feel free to hit me up
I'll I and I think that you know I i'm

533
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,418
II it to ninety right I i want to get
going

534
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,940
like you know let's see if we can easily
call right so I mean %ah you know spread

535
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,100
it around so people about it let's see
if you're interested in something

536
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,969
and let's get some mines on a person's
not run with it let's sit in like

537
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,010
actually unit that meant

538
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,309
conference call or something like that
we sit there and say well we want to try

539
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:37,450
with a bill that will make

540
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,200
love sup I would love to see something
you know implemented

541
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,220
I you know all even if it's like on a
walk test site

542
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,960
that being

543
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,270
cool the implement something like this

544
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,290
um you know in school systems or or or
somehow

545
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,090
get it you know the exact I reach kids
are really in and getting thinking about

546
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,939
you know how to construct secure
passwords but also

547
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,090
um you know exposing to information
security topics as well earlier

548
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,730
the child as a beginner's mind missus
you know exactly less assumptions going

549
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,360
through last

550
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,719
la cage there they're just gonna isn't
like the learning like me

551
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,240
so yeah its g'night means

552
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,770
was you can see from

553
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:30,770
thank you guys every every on

554
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,449
but they're the well
