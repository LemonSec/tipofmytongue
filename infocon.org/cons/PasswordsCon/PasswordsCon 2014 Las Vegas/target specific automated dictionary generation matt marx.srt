20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,289
in the face funny that's that a then I
have a look at Woodlands some structure

24
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,450
presents like this future work and and
then and then take questions at the end

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,509
you know hasn't are saw to get so it is
very humble beginnings

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,210
hours a oh so close but becoming the per

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,259
ya same its

28
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,700
mmm that a that a cool on

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,409
sauce tossed with becoming you know so
the possible to a concert

30
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,829
all workers on a one off as possible
those workers and Intel im

31
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:56,199
has time for Windows demand um and I was
near the field so I just so does

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,030
I just saw the throne United the
traditional thing just read it you know

33
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,780
brute force attack in 100 about this new
thing called mark attacks and ditch

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,390
attack

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,229
and i got to that stage resort but we
had a your tennis talk

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,810
yes she said expendable very nice but
three set points which

37
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,989
I'm you know that that's the threshold
at which either

38
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,069
by virtue of the techniques using all
the hardware restriction you have

39
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,640
you actually you caught you disc one
person for the struggling to

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,010
to crack and track anything more and so
before I began my neck survive tration

41
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm above attack on the dump I

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,170
you know I just a thought Mabius maybe
that there was something that was

43
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,700
relevant to the company then formed

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,140
a the kinda close with someone chose and
so

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,629
on but just on that will %uh that also
love

46
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,379
Ajmer expand on this so this the sort of
Archer to approach and the diminishing

47
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,060
returns

48
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,459
I'm just Pasig a concert the first round
of issue you normally get quite quick

49
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,150
results as long as some sort of basic

50
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,560
to treat 10,000 was possible to
something similar so through best to

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,319
call

52
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,099
whatever it may be and on you know you
track a large number passwords

53
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,829
and then do something else you know you
next round might be more specific

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,900
extreme up to start to protect you you
know they're out to get you the

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,670
and on three that she did and so on and
so forth and so the point to re talking

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,920
about is when you get your own in

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,099
which is different for different people
but it's at that stage where we sort of

58
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,768
got it yet to its and Yukon

59
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:21,220
United struggling to to crack anything
further

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,830
um and so that that that's where was and
bear in mind that

61
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,069
on a justice it has been a month a

62
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:31,899
the situation for the dump all those
working working with this this is some

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,790
context for it

64
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,590
I'm so had its ups and downs but had its
head office in a suburb called on North

65
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,299
Park Place

66
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,940
about to change this information on the
industry was in was in retail

67
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,109
and it had distributors all over the
country on

68
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,299
and so this was the I mean this is a
very crude

69
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,620
serve dictionary but the supper together
and a foot massage you know maybe

70
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,510
there's a chance that

71
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,689
you notes on his small them to serve
2002 search those nations

72
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,959
maybe maybe some these words informs
summit since people met

73
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,370
and so you can separate Johannesburg
retail marketing

74
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,890
a North Park Place the company and sales
and

75
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,250
to my to my surprise on the

76
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,070
the next the next alteration Iran I
attracts a cracked all these

77
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,779
so your notebook place 1234 other water
the company name in retail want to you

78
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,048
and

79
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,469
Johannesburg its mission of course which
one and so on and so forth

80
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,300
at the Thomas joining us in very serve
agree on

81
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,729
a modest rig so I don't have a lot of
Audrey months puzzle um

82
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,820
and so that this was really this really
quite a quite a breakthrough

83
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,880
minnows known as was walkin some some is
a with very important ashes

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,009
I'm terms the company layout to have
cracked

85
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,040
on sorry look at something like this
with poppers 23:04 and

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,229
and you ask yourself is this good boss
would and I mean look that there there

87
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:51,849
is a true

88
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,020
she read about things about this a
sequence that kept the capital I'm late

89
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
season was the first which is common I
mean it's

90
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,190
the two two big mistakes but its

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,820
it's over 15 characters long um its on
obviously bad rich with us not gonna

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,289
turn up

93
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,380
in a in ago frequents poss realists

94
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,820
I'm and its its readership skewl suburb
so even if you did serve journalist

95
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,190
in South Africa this would be um that
they would be

96
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,750
it's unlikely you'd you had that
wouldn't

97
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,110
but in a snore in which you sat on its
roommates and she said you know I've

98
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,940
just been given this

99
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,850
the job is a sysadmin at at this company
that does retail and got a hit of schism

100
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,780
in North Park Place Mall my password is
both took place 1234

101
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,020
you can have to say that's really really
but um that's really what about botsford

102
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,780
um and so so it's really interesting so

103
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,340
wide why do people choose to that

104
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,119
what %uh I don't know what people choose
I'm also adds that

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,370
a that assorted relates to the industry
it might be because they

106
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,410
the possible to see at the company that
the work is greater than the

107
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,740
it requires more than the normal route
where the use or

108
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,460
maybe I want to separate have a
distinction between work life in the

109
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,210
private life in these deposits

110
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,270
I don't know but on the idea was so that
a lot of people

111
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,900
end up using things related to the
industry and the company they work for

112
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,169
the job they're doing on and so we're
done right so

113
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,090
I did have a bid to hear on and I didn't
really find anything that was all tatted

114
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,119
that did what I wanted to do and that's
take a boat suspect the people who

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,430
influenced by the industry than

116
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,360
the environment in %uh the company
despite the company I work for

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm so when it's a good one to the SPECT
and there's nothing out there really

118
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,710
that did this

119
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm in the way that I want to do it so
best idea behind word on is that

120
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,520
I give you an auction company of poverty
targets um

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,520
and what I want you to do an objective
was just give me

122
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,258
a custom with us specifically crafted
for that that target

123
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,690
I'm what I want in that witness what I
want things that or

124
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,240
the main specific in terms that language
so on things a better lets the company

125
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,389
the industry they

126
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,840
therein um maybe products they sell that
people

127
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,929
involved on just I want I wanna a big
blob text

128
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,620
about the country basically wall i'm
looking in such a bus

129
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,229
salute tell you what used to triple but
you know their number

130
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,990
really creative and and or something the
judge in store just so the team uses

131
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,440
stuff it's a terrific we discuss up for
the trees

132
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,430
but their their number things re we can
use it for once we have it

133
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,440
because the challenges is having its so
word on really

134
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,190
is what I'd like it to be is a tool that
pushes you from the special the chat now

135
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,690
um and packing those those bottle you
know a couple up since

136
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,460
extra extra houses as going towards
individual in the future that

137
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,719
essentially on so the idea behind home
from into this was basically that there

138
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,300
be three phases there's an
information-gathering sage

139
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,810
in which you know I just went Barton got
everything I could about the company or

140
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,720
the target

141
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,050
that includes just %uh from the website
PDF that they have

142
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,060
social media in the object tax refund on

143
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,410
strip it annoys stuff that wasn't
relevant to the company so you know with

144
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,379
like and because you don't love them and
that's what

145
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,930
that's what useful stuff and then funny
just dinner with us

146
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm from that and so stayed one right so

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,590
this is getting into hold action commit
to that on

148
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,039
so ya so the information gathered stages

149
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,599
obviously when most important ones a
bill to reply quote a based on top o the

150
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,319
link checker

151
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,139
a.m. the two I've also got PDF
extraction you know

152
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,270
was as a mention things like company
handbooks public release is that they

153
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,030
might have

154
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,729
on any published works that they've take
papers they've given up

155
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,780
I wasn't great to date with Twitter so
you can you know if you wanna real-world

156
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,598
some proper people saying about a given

157
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,550
searched him it's a really nice on it's
really nice to know source willing to

158
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,769
choose

159
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,269
um so the result is this of two
countries gathered information phases

160
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,580
you got just a massive

161
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,890
local text its huge its enormous much he
probably much 52

162
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,149
100 bux not much nonsense was put in not
that relevant

163
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,800
to to the demand um but all the same in
the

164
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,109
buried inside a bit or important words
an important

165
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,380
phrases people products and that's
something that relate to to the

166
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,610
the target um and this leads the next
but and this is really the heart but

167
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,260
hardly makes sense that's what's
important

168
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,589
I mean I don't dick strip 10000 with
that is you know it 9500 a completely

169
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:13,320
irrelevant

170
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,620
I'm up and so United

171
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,050
you could've taken this is the first in
a cross your minds is look at something

172
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,680
like a blacklist implement of course you
military rites will

173
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,170
good luck blacklisting all the words
don't want in a in

174
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,860
in the English language it's not saudis
it I'm in the same as what this

175
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,730
I mean if you really know what with you
you will you accept that you basically

176
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,959
got addiction

177
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,989
on and so wanna settle on a bench was
having a standard a comparison so

178
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,990
I miss you did this with um I use
project gutenberg:

179
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,810
and odometer whole bunch books I
asserted that the sums to school now

180
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,180
this is a halt in with the Canon what
would a

181
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,120
and then what's good news you can take a
big number text and you pick up first

182
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,610
witness the weather

183
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,870
now the word the appears you know
forty-three thousand times for every

184
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,610
million words whatever it may be

185
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,190
and we look at often appears in texture
and then you're not match up

186
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,260
you know what this is probably not
significant throw it away

187
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,370
but all of a sudden we're doing a bank
reeve we've got a hold on

188
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,670
you know it's sorta Baba information
about the bank and would finance has

189
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,170
appeared

190
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,560
ten times more frequently in all
collection phase and it has

191
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,239
in literature Amanda generally better
life and so high on this

192
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,220
this look significant let's put the side
that's the time it to this this could be

193
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,130
important

194
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,800
on and of course that this is this is
really nice did but

195
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,689
using summing up what's good nigga very
quickly discovered that languages

196
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,149
I mean you worship you say no language
changes goals you know butts

197
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,959
it really does on the condo it was a
really bad stunned at the century

198
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,439
because

199
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,680
a lot of stuff going over copyright as a
you know hundred-plus years old

200
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,959
and was in a good reflection of how we
spoke no I mean do it internet

201
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,729
for the kid a your new website is prolly
not significant but

202
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,490
project gutenberg: no idea what that was
and and so that was a good standard a

203
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,079
comparison

204
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,439
so this this this they don't you um the
corpus linguistics which is essentially

205
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,329
the idea that's linguist you she
studying language and that the basic

206
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,569
serpents behind is that

207
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,430
if you wanna study language the best way
to do it is look at how it's used in

208
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,599
in real life amounts owed they basically
got

209
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,740
they they create these huge I'm corpses
that have got you know the hundreds

210
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,649
millions words

211
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,610
big and with a met up with everything
they met up with movies

212
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,160
like you know dialects movies on theater
books textbooks

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
on every subject physics biology
chemistry what everybody

214
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,140
so that is this really massive I'm sOooo
it's an attempt to have an

215
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,160
all-encompassing representation of

216
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,399
language um and what's good about it is
that

217
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
so we we do in 2014 let's say read it
this year um

218
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,170
you know big research institution you
know cops called on a

219
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,019
and what you have singed is a big step
should english at that time so you gotta

220
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,899
be at your representation holds use

221
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,630
including slang words in considerate
local praises

222
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,959
you've got a really nice representation
Jojo languages used at the given time

223
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,768
so that your the Republic publicist
excess ones on the oxford university

224
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,250
when you have to request three

225
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,560
22 Texas to but universalist one is the
one word on is built on

226
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,569
at the moment on and I'm gonna be I'm
gonna beast so shortly transitioning

227
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,740
over stocks addiction which I just got
access to recently

228
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,930
on so this is a really nice time a
comparison so we've got a really

229
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,459
occurred representation apollo

230
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,859
of which jenin you know in English and
can compare this

231
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,740
against stuff we've got it on the
website 00 on the PDF's or just through

232
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,220
the

233
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,160
on the company essentially on

234
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,290
and so ya so false-positive this is this
a good finish with

235
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,930
ru with the with any auspicious
intelligence system

236
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,010
essentially I'm so it's impossible to
predict results

237
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,950
i mean that was going to be words that
annoys the and she said that racial to

238
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,690
hire you gonna miss stuff and if so too
does going to get a lot more

239
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,639
more junk in on and so this is really a
challenge I'm

240
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,690
but it was pretty it works pretty well
on in

241
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,740
in incident if the native combating the
the redundancy or

242
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,029
and the noise basically a coalition

243
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,269
a correlation which was also in second
um

244
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,290
and then the final phase routine
information gathering the processing

245
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,319
and then final phase is just the Prophet
faces

246
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,790
basically once you take anywhere just a
budget evaluate what support or not

247
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,339
and watch got is the dictionary remains
I'm

248
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,370
so the structure would on-base kitten a
as a as a tool works like this you have

249
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,329
an industry

250
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,930
so it's a banking and then chew the
industry belongs a number of clients a

251
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,550
glove

252
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,899
you can maintain your own you know
you're not to choose a good at your bank

253
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,440
expect wind bank said

254
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,810
on that will belong to banking on at a
client level

255
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,979
their number things you can do so as I
mentioned you can both those those

256
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,500
fortunes have it my mistaken build up
the addiction from its research and look

257
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,050
Aug GPS a player or the website I'm and
in addition to conform aggregation so

258
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,829
you could you can

259
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,519
you served as concatenate the text
recent into one message a tree or

260
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm you can form additional correlation
between between the text you to touch on

261
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,949
in the second

262
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:02,620
I'm and then industry level you can't do
much but

263
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,880
each other what you can do I'm is
actually quite useful so

264
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,250
we've got thank you X and back XO you
know it's some sort of specific inch

265
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,620
the sure loan insurance or something and
so it's picked that up as a word

266
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,350
because bank why don't have that and so
what you can do to conserve

267
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,889
try and trace common threads across the
various klein's that you've got to

268
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,000
launch an industry

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,740
and what you have left is a on edge in
Eric industry dictionary

270
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,540
I'm going to speed up a bit I think does
I saw who lets

271
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,880
on right so basically as a case study so
I'm

272
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,230
a step that the so basically as a very
brief case I'm gonna

273
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,790
serve rushed to the Sun I was work for
the battlefield I'm just because I mean

274
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,189
it couldn't work within the corporate
stuff I'd really like to show you

275
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,139
you know an actual dump its for obvious
in the reasons I I'm not going to

276
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,279
on so benefits or to make a bit more
challenging just to show you that I'm

277
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:54,560
not

278
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,880
knows just spamming 2002 trees and one
show that people of influence but

279
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,060
a you know by then issued and and what
this one about

280
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,819
I put on a really up with us in a VM
running it went with a grand a

281
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,630
single-core processor which is

282
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,949
is not probably the best a the district
cracking

283
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:15,399
so this is a very quick demo on this is

284
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,649
this is where it held um and I'm gonna
run this on

285
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,740
on on the website the only thing I've
done beforehand is created an industry

286
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,529
call gaming

287
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,490
and a client call battlefield I'm it's
you know it's just it's really simple

288
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,290
I'm and then of selected to all the tree
from the website you insert euro

289
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,939
8 restricted to demand so if you don't
call the whole and sits in Chi

290
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,769
um you can do that but I actually I
haven't won a so extended and and look

291
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:39,529
at things that the

292
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:43,649
that much into and and pulls on that a
fall sport at all this side

293
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,160
this is really quick and you can sit
there occurs in depth and all that kinda

294
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,800
good stuff

295
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,139
um and then that's just a bit pruning
you'll see that when yet we have a pair

296
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:53,990
of twin island

297
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,130
a cool so that's that

298
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,189
on this is this is not registered for
the first to know

299
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,000
30 words whatever and also highlighted
some some the ones you can see already

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,839
re-election good words using against a
ban on some way related would be really

301
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,509
good in conjunction with each other

302
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,050
I'm when you're taking something like a
better feel them so that was our team

303
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,880
the vehicle mine and mechanics
PlayStation

304
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,930
whole body and soldiers general campaign
shotgun Battlefield Heroes

305
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,199
just picked up all these words things
that stand out as a

306
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,519
as distinct on I'm gonna up or going to
skip this but it's it's very much the

307
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,110
same thing

308
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,480
um this is just a running off to a sauce
applied battlefield the system

309
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,600
and when to call you know 800 so treats

310
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,670
it's like ten thousand words a tokens
from that

311
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,029
can analyze um and again so this is a
little support from the Twitter would

312
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,100
decide if its citizens are caught two
reassignments brigade

313
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,220
battlefield battles campaign character
classes

314
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,399
China see all these things and relevant
to someone who's a

315
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,509
he's going to be is going to be playing
Battlefield ascension

316
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,670
thinking no thank you this kinda thing
which is a plus with

317
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,520
on so you know this is on that really
really slow thing and was like

318
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,119
it was actually in the tens aka of
possible second ominous crooked I think

319
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,428
on the the the summit some other cool
examples they can see that

320
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,299
you know you got PlayStation place in
stationed there is a crisis battlefield

321
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:16,760
so that's

322
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,189
you know it's another game but you can
see that this goes obviously gamer I'm

323
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,809
and its that's we're going to the Notre
Dame's this ghost Warrior

324
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,879
this is Unreal Tournament I'm is
electronic what's that

325
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,200
so these all possible straight from the
dump on a really really bad

326
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Rick like based Louis Republic get

327
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,320
on a

328
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,750
gonna explode he discovered that on
that's really look

329
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,559
it's really simple she's right on so you
not in on the so much for the demos go

330
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,700
to sell

331
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,070
I'm its it's really simple base coated
Fullington on

332
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,340
right also running on the sterile system
I a dollar a whole bunch PDF's

333
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,860

cloud-based solo guys using LinkedIn I

336
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:07,020
a industries and what I did for for the
trouble to this widget on a whole bunch

337
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,350

entrepreneurial you know manual for
business

339
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,789
kinda PDX can get free online a dollar
than the couple under pages long each

340
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,240
up form to a runway dawned on them said
sped up the trees which

341
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,289
at Port ok with a total were important
and then a car lets them so

342
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:27,010
unwanted not something the GOS every of
his garage in his own way to someone's

343
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,940
gonna fly Cup

344
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,620
amorphous should on but you're on a
correlation across them so that it takes

345
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,719
a common threads that appear close to
all the PTS you run

346
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,730
and ya so this is a really nice golf
legend so we've got are denied not

347
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,929
conduct business connects

348
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,169
a business contacts social networking I

349
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,330
take mental capsule United and so on and
so forth so

350
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,928
even a really really primitive system
you know you you kicking some

351
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:55,190
some who also its and then just put
anecdotes I'm to to finish off and look

352
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,070
out like a miniature

353
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,649
questions on so always been the
possibilites a

354
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,770
lee gets you get a lot houses crack and

355
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,879
I randomly got one from the guy in the
UK on

356
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,660
and there's no subject no hi he's got
this has gone into a mash

357
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,250
so other new notes to the pits to
another one is cricket

358
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,370
on and sauce to put it back on for forty
my old cell productions

359
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,500
again on it was a massive multinational
in

360
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,650
in in Europe this was for sysadmin and

361
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,150
the company worked in finance and so I

362
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,150
Iran around would hold on this um and

363
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,280
it turns out that that was is his boss
would

364
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,480
on and so again it's a really nice
example love

365
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,850
apollo but ya so that slow network for
this goes back to college to see

366
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,320
but it's fun stuff but again that's

367
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,399
you can see that is the industry's
working is directly influence was chosen

368
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,590
as possible

369
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,809
um so that's those those pretty cool

370
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,610
a few traditions would haunt a real
export multiple languages as you

371
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,379
to manage their way to go presentation
you know that its its Corpus dependent

372
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,850
so

373
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,120
I mean really comes on to acquiring
their various no

374
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,610
other languages corpses she's the real
challenge I'm

375
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,979
I'd like to get more social social media
things like Wikipedia also a great

376
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,820
source who

377
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,830
other a daughter and then the course
will open source

378
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,439
love to get some of the best for you
guys final what's useful what you need

379
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,929
you know what would be more useful I'm
it implements a bit

380
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,450
on and you'll join again hold me you can
get hold many those three those mediums

381
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,780
on you can download the tool from the
pocket open up shop

382
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,480
this I'm and yup thanks guys

383
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,600
on not taking questions

384
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,990
anything else and care about so yet

385
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,960
user video are mining you start using
video

386
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,360
card CPU rather than traditional sepia
man you'll save yourself

387
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,340
allotted time yasser thats so that's a
good point so I mean

388
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,408
that the point to this wasn't really to
say that's

389
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm you know

390
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,950
so it so their number wage could use the
extra jets by this you could literally

391
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,150
just put it through its Jonah

392
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,169
it Johnson a fairly modest rig I'm you
could put it through

393
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:17,429
%uh United that the traditional victory
in rule-based Tech which is

394
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,150
thats that's one who's been in on and I
think you at

395
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,559
Genesis tortoise but including including
words are relevant is that industry

396
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,780
specific to things like to me says the
tax

397
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,250
and I mean a common a true texan and the
so the more complex

398
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,750
attacks which which require you know the
most that can get and more relevant

399
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,820
get the better um that's you know that's
where to go I mean to I don't actually

400
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,158
use if you live your life in a crack
passwords

401
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,510
on I don't other on this and see if you
know me as a sting that sorta

402
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,940
to kinda make a bit more challenging
more fun

403
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,500
but on don't know thanks thanks that

404
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,370
then your

405
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,979
car group why were some other passwords
that you showed earlier on

406
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,299
you my in your later your

407
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,289
screenshot caught earlier on if you'd
been doing for instance Combinator

408
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,299
attack so that kinda thing

409
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:16,150
a Tesla I'm right so so that those both
examples i'd had run anything on them I

410
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,360
just honored them and run

411
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,539
I would hold extreme on them and the
point was not thats

412
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,230
this is got stuff it's impossible to
crack otherwise the point was just that

413
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,630
even on a really low system on you could
you can I consider show just for

414
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,020
demonstration purposes that

415
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,320
people of influenced by the issue and
that use plus with let you know crisis

416
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,139
battlefield or

417
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,409
you know the scholars office today menu
consists you can tell a lot by

418
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,750
I'm by what issues and possible for
cinching

419
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,590
cricket so know that that wasn't say
that those a possible to track otherwise

420
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,129
I mean

421
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,340
data god-like your niece and you a crack
was but what are you reading to collect

422
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,870
any symptoms would on pictures spare on
with and

423
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,330
I'm you know up into gets really
interesting

424
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,510
which the results don't think stress

425
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,260
rust a in the ass

426
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,150
cool Gus thank you very much appreciate
