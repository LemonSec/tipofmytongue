1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,189
okay does a

2
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:09,110
that txt of the road them good

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,730
yeah

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:20,699
way markets or get together yes

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,789
hi everyone

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,919
my name's Nick Parker were sheared
presenting about a

7
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:31,179
enhancing password pace key derivation
techniques

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:35,160
on I work with the satanic I'm they set
a buy one

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,720
my and my name is Steven lombardo

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,350
across with a turkey and based on a new
jersey dump

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,890
every been

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,240
so one other projects that we work on

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,700
spent a lot of time on as is sick with
Sypher the want to stay get a

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,730
feel for the RAM anyone from know you're
with sickle safer at all

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,300
Cascio some also

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,500
sequel light green that you okay so if
you people are from much

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,270
so simple safer is based on sequel I
it's an open source extension

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,440
not to seek a light that provides for
database encryption

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,610
and him

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,420
so you know saying that

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,930
sequels sequelae is a embedded database

22
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,750
and so it has a very large platform
target

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,120
you know if you well so if you if you
want to look at that the different

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,159
languages and

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,600
and platforms it would run on we we
basically operate on

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,860
on on a many of those a yes easy plus
plus it I'm not I won't read the whole

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,979
list but some

28
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,460
there's a good chance that if you
develop in that that's equal ciphers

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,809
gonna run on that platform

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,130
so I we we often find ourselves with cum
OVA

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,048
broad spectrum abusers that that use
that

32
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,880
for various means I they both operate a
mobile and desktop space

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,100
I but our focus today is specifically on
securing user data

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,269
where the user provides apportion the
key material

35
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,150
room so

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,620
was going to take a quick look
high-level how Siegel Center works

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,430
I'm so there's transparent interaction
at as a

38
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,230
as a client developer you don't have to
deal with any of the encryption

39
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,690
buddy Christian process it all happens
on the fly so that

40
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,440
you have a client's database API that
you consume

41
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,319
and everything just works to provide the
the passphrase

42
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,708
and you get your data based on your
queries ago operate on

43
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,150
when you insert data we we store that we
went up to for you automatically

44
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,790
it's on the fly so in other words

45
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,549
the entire files interpreted however if
you

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,660
but are querying for certain portion and
a doubter

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,430
file it it all only decreased the amount
of data that needs to retrieve that for

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,200
him

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,940
we have but crypto provider system

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,349
so structured within the library itself
allows us to swap out

51
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,000
different trip to providers by to fall
we use open SSL

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,590
I'm we Porter thats than use

53
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,599
come to tell for for I O S as an example

54
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,410
and then lipped on trips for other
platforms were open ass cells into

55
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,099
appropriate from years is that we use a
standard

56
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,170
KDF PBK tf2 I and

57
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,780
so historically you know sometimes
people ask us why

58
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,530
you know why why don't you use other key
derivation

59
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,680
approaches US trip has become a very
popular

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,700
I R you know approach and

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,209
Siegel Center predates a script so

62
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,840
said to visualize the structure of how
data is stored

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,930
I'm every database when it's created
gets a

64
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,769
a unique her database salt and then

65
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,920
that the the actual database stores

66
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,250
these like a pic blocks of data in pages

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,120
and see you got your own crib that block
a

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,030
Asia a unique initialization vector and
then

69
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,138
a Mac for the date up or

70
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,190
can everyone hear me OK I can I keep
come in and out

71
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,210
and yep

72
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm so sold with

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,430
come with that said II wanna take a step
back and look at how

74
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,479
how sick all sectors evolved over the
years okay

75
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,990
so when we initially release said we had
%uh

76
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,260
iteration link 4,000 in

77
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,639
as it relates to computing the key

78
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,060
3pk tf2 and just recently

79
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,340
think the mean maybe a little over a
year ago we

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,070
the suites which we operate at the
library and changed it so that you

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,349
64,000

82
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,570
generations been

83
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,290
you'll note that what we did too high
means

84
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,740
you know on various devices when we we
made those initial

85
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,479
me configurations and then when we we
have created their

86
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,050
they were there are still you know
somewhat arbitrary you know we

87
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,090
we verify that they didn't take too long
there so arbitrary

88
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,770
I'm use so

89
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,549
what we look that is you know maybe we
can

90
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,250
we can do things better so we think we
have to approach is that

91
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,690
that are applicable in the context the
sequel cipher

92
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,410
so the first one is an adaptive ski
dervish approach

93
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,600
and the second one is multi-factor
hardware token immigration

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,310
morning

95
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,910
okay some gonna put the mic down

96
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,940
for a split second were

97
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,979
its hey

98
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,719
almost nothing there

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,229
them hot that group if you can't read
that

100
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:12,210
but so this this story kinda predates a
goes back a couple years

101
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,448
a two years ago I was down in in Brazil
and had a conversation with

102
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,970
I'm Jacob Appelbaum and he can have

103
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,280
came up we're talking about people say
for any he mentioned that

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,650
you know have got a Android g1 such

105
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,679
separately or device comment doesn't
have a lot of computing power

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,139
revenue Android device that's much
better

107
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,180
and the fantastic if you could

108
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,259
take an approach that you don't use a
static

109
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,729
key derivation you know work factor and
an actually take advantage hardware that

110
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,180
a Half Men

111
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,699
so that got us thinking in you know we
got busy

112
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,669
and like everyone does up but but we've
we've

113
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:59,849
we've taken that to heart for

114
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,889
I'm

115
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,639
it going so let's just take a look at
you know what what are some

116
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,590
some the problems that we have with the
static KTF linked

117
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,448
right I'm you know both that stop it you
know mussah time

118
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,210
how many how many of us here develop for
multiple platforms spot that's up in our

119
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,960
are and mobile devices paint so the
hardware specs on those

120
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,080
very tress tically right can't the
technology continues to evolve

121
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,780
were overtime break but iPhones

122
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,030
are able to take advantage a jeep you
acceleration 18 when they deal with

123
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,780
crypto primitive see

124
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,150
I'm and and the reality is that well we
have

125
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,109
you know tools like cash cat that making

126
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,270
I'm do amazing things I

127
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,469
there are different security
requirements for different types and

128
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,590
applications

129
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,590
user experience P change right so I

130
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,789
you know you may be dealing with highly
sensitive data and

131
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:03,039
and await I'm up maybe 10 seconds is
appropriate

132
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,139
when accessing data whereas other
applications may need to be

133
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,410
more snappy in

134
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,130
so if we look at the adapter Katie of
course and cat frame this in the context

135
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,810
of PKD up to

136
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,330
as early it's too what what our goal is
would like that

137
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,120
to provide fast sampling across all
platforms

138
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,979
so even on that g1 device we would like
it to be just as fast relatively

139
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,340
speaking

140
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,669
I'm we want to be able to compute the
ideal work actor

141
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,399
and limited by time right because
ultimately we don't wanna

142
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,198
have to keep take into account the
various hardware components that might

143
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:46,459
planes to you how it would operate

144
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,008
and we would allow like to allow that
same plane to occur on

145
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:54,199
anymore platforms that we sport mmm

146
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,969
so what we came up with is is an
approach

147
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,480
to allow the computation

148
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,959
at the KDF to Iran automatically

149
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,029
you on the device its constrained by
time

150
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,420
no we have a default value

151
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,660
and its tunable so what we're looking at
here is just an example from most

152
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,230
those sick was ever command shell
allowing you to

153
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,230
interacts with the Kate KDF computation
routine

154
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,270
you so cheers just three examples

155
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,590
where we initialize a a database waukee
the database

156
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,650
and we ask it to compute acadia work
factor

157
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,170
now these are all run on a on a Mac Book
Pro 2.3 air its device

158
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,479
and in the default situation where we're
on for one second

159
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,620
I was able to compute just a little over
a million

160
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,340
iterations in the in the scenario again
you know where I i

161
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,950
allow for two seconds to compute I get a
little over 2.2 million

162
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,210
world and if I can strain it down to say
half a second

163
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,680
its its 575,000

164
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,689
iterations so that's you know Justin

165
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,470
in reviewing that so thats quite quite a
spectrum of change

166
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,260
from our static value that we we've had
before been

167
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,470
so here's just a table of various
devices where we've sampled across

168
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,080
hardware and simulators emulators

169
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,340
and phones and you can see that while
there are some devices like the Android

170
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,350
emulator

171
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,920
are you know somewhat close so what are
static values are

172
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,140
I you know all

173
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,580
all that all the various devices there's
were

174
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,790
really doing a disservice the user's in
not taking advantage the hardware that's

175
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,560
available to them

176
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,050
good by using static keep her static
work factor

177
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:02,490
that's for one sec work

178
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,900
so when we switch are talking about

179
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,150
you know computing at work factor on a
per device basis

180
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:15,430
introduces a new set of challenges that
we didn't have to deal with before

181
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,739
previously we have static key rest now
psyche exceeding ascetic

182
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,210
ERATION links and so

183
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,400
quite developer wasn't responsible for
for maintaining that

184
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,480
but now any application that consumes
this

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,130
would have to track what that work
factor value as

186
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,880
in order to you let you know access the
database can so

187
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,400
persisting the KDF work factor becomes
important hitting

188
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,730
we can in fact and that may distort site
yeah

189
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,260
very good question very point the so

190
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,370
so visually we've got to

191
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,040
we've got to pictures going on a disk
read the first the

192
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,410
the far right picture first so but

193
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,180
sickle light has a has a series of
layers

194
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,839
I ants the at that the very bottom layer

195
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,850
they implant what's called a virtual
filesystem so it's their extraction

196
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,500
where

197
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,720
to in or out with various operating
systems

198
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm with reading and writing up files

199
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,160
such a and so we have a new

200
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,750
sequel safer virtual filesystem the tax
is like a facade

201
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,970
around the underlying virtual filesystem

202
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,710
and allows us to control writing a
header

203
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,290
which will persist the information
that's relevant to us

204
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,370
so computed katya for factor on device

205
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,480
would automatically be stored within the
Davis file

206
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,920
sup hmmm I'm

207
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,420
everything else continues remain the
same as the previous example gift

208
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,180
forget that Davis all and then our pages

209
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,719
data so essentially is a means to have

210
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,900
offset point you so yeah kinda

211
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,939
forget about all this data starts here
instead of here

212
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,420
%um Cup

213
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,860
now so historically but

214
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,140
sickle several ship with the false
default KTF

215
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,590
work fact you know we're tractor Lancs
the fall ciphers

216
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,240
I page sizes and all those things are

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,480
are adjustable from a climb every
perspective so

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,590
I you can yet two options essentially

219
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,770
you could use the defaults which is
generally what

220
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,880
what people would do or what we would
recommend and

221
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,510
the other option was to change that and
if you change them

222
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,200
the client was responsible for supplying
with those values were

223
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,770
before you interacted with and see you
are done you know

224
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,780
up your connection to database Supplier
configuration parameters

225
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,140
and then interact with ago

226
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,260
his better ball and up

227
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,939
my lawyers honor right be

228
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,690
so the the question if if this new
header includes all that information

229
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,730
%uh yes and now so this is a there's an
experimental branch right now

230
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,700
I we have I almost all that information
stored

231
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,710
I'm however some that information we
would week there's more information that

232
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,860
we like to include in that header

233
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,320
so it's not finalized yet but it's but
it's pretty close the

234
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,660
the at the idea here is to make it as
simple as possible for the client

235
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,500
developer

236
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,190
to consume the library and still take
advantage if

237
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:50,160
up being able to compute a a new work
factor

238
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,680
so for tonight take a look at you know
the present ons

239
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,469
up %uh being able to computer an
adaptive

240
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,890
work factor you know the pro here is
that we get a sample across all

241
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,470
all platforms we can constrain it by
time

242
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,400
right so it's it's it's consistent by
time which is

243
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,880
really from an end user's perspective
what's you know important whether or not

244
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,590
they

245
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:20,380
have access you know with Anna half a
second or 10 seconds

246
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,830
and and we can sample that across

247
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,260
all devices PBK tf2 being

248
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,660
you know are art arced computation
routine

249
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,089
focuses strictly on doing out to let
your calculations

250
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,550
so icons yes not

251
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:44,140
cross a vice performance so what that
means is something

252
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,880
you know for example with Jacob
Appelbaum his G one

253
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,770
me as a the new Android device and

254
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,340
the work factor is going to be
dramatically different between those two

255
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,370
devices

256
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,000
so I'm or now if you take my

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,290
my Mac Book Pro I can compute a very
high work factor

258
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,300
and if i tryin interact with that
database on advice

259
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,020
as spore her work performance

260
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,020
the time at that point

261
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,530
does not is not does not scale well

262
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:23,170
this also introduces additional complex
you within the sequel cipher could best

263
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,579
so that that onus falls on Nazi

264
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,370
cool

265
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,890
I'm absolutely I'll

266
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:42,890
you watch this ago system

267
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,560
so so the question is if

268
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,410
if we watch for system loan I'm to
answer that

269
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,589
yes and no %uh so there are certain
environments

270
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,700
I am in particular so simple cipher runs
on

271
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,640
on Android on on the Android platform
and I want one other things that we've

272
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,630
seen

273
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,410
I'm overtime and and its I don't know if
it's

274
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,840
I think it's would specific to that

275
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,948
to the Android platform but it's also
may be partially red

276
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,350
relate to the client library in terms of
how things work you've got a

277
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,629
a job I'll a ridge and I are a player
you know and then

278
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,560
native where and so there's there's a
lot of things that are kinda playing

279
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,030
and so we've seen scenarios where I

280
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,170
you know opening a connection to a
database where and

281
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,960
that first operation where it actually
has to drive the key

282
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,170
can take can certainly longer and

283
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,300
the fact that you have devices that have
a a very broad spectrum

284
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,490
I love fun of behaviors in terms of

285
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,350
of how what they support I

286
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,409
week you know you do you do see things
like that I'm generally speaking I would

287
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,150
say he

288
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,220
you don't I'm on other platforms but
parted

289
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,920
but based on man is we used the
information that we've seen as we

290
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,870
profile image

291
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,020
to determine what kind of what our
default recommendation is

292
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,389
for the default time period because

293
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,870
up so we we of I also work on strip
which is a

294
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,889
cross-platform pass for Data Manager

295
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,669
and so week we experience the same
things

296
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,510
as well com in terms of the performance

297
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,090
I'm and that user experience cell

298
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm from you know but again it's

299
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,800
its tunable I guess to to the
environment the put it in

300
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,950
doing his

301
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,480
history this capture got

302
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,020
I'm say it

303
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,840
that say she's

304
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,399
cat talking about yessir absolutely our
solutions things without

305
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,450
yes yes you're absolutely yeah I love to
talk about

306
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,130
anybody else are we can take questions
later tour of wine so

307
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,440
meeting

308
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,450
thanks I'm right so that the next thing
that we start to take a look at with

309
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,890
I am she you know can enhance saying are
standard

310
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,960
curation functions iron is

311
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,770
how we might be able to integrate a
multi-factor

312
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,810
scenario where hot getting access to a
database

313
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,590
is no longer just about one factor which
is the pass phrase that you know

314
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,300
but there's also the requirement to
present something that you have

315
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,450
something on your percent and that would
be a hardware token

316
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,640
so stepping back up briefly here

317
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,320
got

318
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,530
no go

319
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,870
okay so I stepping back we've got

320
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,199
our current KDS rate which is to pick a
diff to and inputs dysfunction are

321
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
essentially

322
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,500
that the database key which is provided
by the user and that's the passphrase

323
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,510
now we have this random database all
which we store as you saw from that the

324
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,480
picture the neck talk about we start
read it but

325
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,540
at the front the file on and that's
generated randomly for every individual

326
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,530
databases created

327
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,700
now we have this new adaptive work
factor and those Aug combine

328
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,870
passant into I pick ATF to to generate
are corruption keywords actually be set

329
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,889
to encrypt the page it up

330
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,169
so what we'd ideally I'm like to do is
say well how can we

331
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,419
at a you know Harbor talking to the next
we have some requirements for

332
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,850
so ideally we want something to me

333
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,850
our requirements that would work offline
so there's a lot of both

334
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,340
serve got going back to the previous
talk about what is authentication verses

335
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,120
encryption

336
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,219
there's a lot of multi-factor
authentication solutions out there

337
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
you've got

338
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,100
you know TOTP Eve got you know you vicki
has won their stay up for a variety of

339
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,889
fun but one of the key things that this

340
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,070
Stream porn is always another party the
chance medication

341
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,879
should we have test center network
activity and we really don't wanna put

342
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,250
that requirement in for a system like
sickle safer

343
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,500
where there may be a requirement
specific requirements for offline data

344
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,460
access

345
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm or maybe you don't really trust any
other party's do authentication

346
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,710
so that's really a critical one and that
leads us to

347
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,360
you know how do we interface with the
hardware token would like it to be

348
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,389
something simple

349
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,580
you know USB ideally I am in a best-case
scenario the tokens would be very widely

350
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,899
available

351
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,690
so I you know something that you can
really go out and buy

352
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,000
I you know kinda commodity product

353
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,060
I and one that provides on board crypto

354
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,330
so we're not you know introducing at
more complex into the sequel safer

355
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,310
database

356
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,960
I and since we're going to be doing some
sort of both you know

357
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,810
some surprise tho crypto operations and
it's going to be tied to the token

358
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,690
we need to have security storage I'm
generally means that you can write to

359
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,260
you know whatever you're talking as you
can write a random key to it once you do

360
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,790
that

361
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,000
you can't get a back office if I lose
the token or something like that

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,880
somebody can

363
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,890
extract the key off a bit on

364
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,669
if its multi use an inexpensive is wild
and that's even better

365
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,620
so there's a couple different there's
there's actually more than one

366
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,830
hardware token available that will will
meet s kinda requirement

367
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,730
and the for the first one is a is Yuki
and has anybody familiar with the keys

368
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,310
at all

369
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,240
okay call so CA you keys are pretty neat
there these are all

370
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,320
you know USB hardware tokens are kinda
like this there's actually two form

371
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,290
factors

372
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm one is a big one that's kinda
intended to be carried on your keychain

373
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,730
I'm has the key on the one that you have
over there the little tiny one is called

374
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,550
the Nano

375
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,050
that that's a actually intended more to
be left inside over USB port

376
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,830
you can it jammed in there has a very
low form factor and you don't take it

377
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,860
out

378
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,060
up you can get out but you generally
good n

379
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,800
so we have arm is so you because you've
been around for quite a while

380
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,168
on we've been having kinda long history
with them we did a little open source

381
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,250
project while ago that got us thinking

382
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,210
a little bit about this which is a
project I'm called one time

383
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,590
offer you the key and what we wanted to
do with that

384
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,939
I a brief departure is a light to do I'm

385
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,810
time base one-time passwords like your
Google two-factor authentication

386
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,700
somewhere your secret is actually stored
on Yuki

387
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,320
so we got into looking at the interface
and and has our you know us we dove

388
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,260
on board crypto functions that you can
call they're practically indestructible

389
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,600
I can run over on their waterproof
people routinely right and about how

390
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:28,980
they

391
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,640
possum in the washing machine then dried
him for three hours and historic

392
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,770
and they're inexpensive individually
they only cost Lake

393
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,300
25 for the larger form factor and maybe
forty for the smaller one

394
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,870
mom but if you buy men Bach that the
pricing goes down very considerably

395
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,060
there

396
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,720
and the other one that we identified is
kind of a new entrant called

397
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,080
da plug are plugged up and these have a
very similar

398
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,470
kinda form factor that they look a
little bit like this state they actually

399
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,159
ship from

400
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,190
on what looks like a smart card where
it's kinda carved out he pop it out

401
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,970
yourself

402
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,690
for the little tab over on to make it
big enough to fit into a USB port

403
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,000
the tricky thing here's are primarily
available I would say only available in

404
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,010
Europe primarily available in Europe
they don't have a really good solution

405
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,980
for shipping

406
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,050
to the US now so I'll while the the
talking themselves are only about eight

407
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,230
your own

408
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm when we ended up getting in there
they were kind enough to give us

409
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,020
I'm some for free for this particular
talk on

410
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,129
that the shipping costs on that ended up
being like about a hundred ten dollars

411
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,780
Stus I so it's it's a it's a little bit

412
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,110
they always get janet shaving right so
that that's a little bit

413
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,178
a little bit skewed but I think you know
they do they do work in

414
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,179
I'm provide very similar functionality
to it you he does some

415
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,300
I my britt really with this common
denominator that we're taking advantage

416
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,879
of

417
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,919
and and that is the fact that they both
provide

418
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,820
and on board H Mac Shaw 1 implementation

419
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,050
it's called Bowl via a challenge
response API to the idea is that you

420
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,940
program your key with one-time you right
out

421
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,760
your random key data and then your
interactions from that point forward

422
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,580
with

423
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,639
the harbour token is I'm gonna give you
some data

424
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,450
and you're going to you sign it and
you're going to give me the data back

425
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,510
and you're going to use the secret key
it's on the device yeah I don't know

426
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,870
what that is anymore

427
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,750
if you get the device you're not gonna
know what it is either

428
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,380
so are simple implementation up

429
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,620
is is really to use this on board token
key

430
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,969
and H Mac um and and we want to

431
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,870
we all wanna fundamentally change PDF to
rate me on a farm in a change key

432
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,969
derivation algorithm

433
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,140
but we wanna say wha how can we enhance
a little bit and the solution

434
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,480
that we come up with that works really
well in this case

435
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,730
is to permeate the database all before
we use it

436
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,350
so if you if you think back to the
approach that we had before

437
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,580
our the salt is sitting there on public
data

438
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,629
in the database Hatter I were actually
gonna take that's all

439
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,870
and using a what we have a provider call
back and she was safer

440
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,439
we're gonna send the SOL into the token

441
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,040
say you know H Mac this with the secret
key

442
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,200
that on a token that we can get to and
take that data out

443
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,880
and pass that and to the key derivation
function

444
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,000
so are archerd a simplified MFA process

445
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,990
adds an on these two factors which is a
token key

446
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,230
secret and is Raksha one and and uses
that operate

447
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,750
to calculate the actual database
encryption key

448
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,270
so the general results here on you know
really

449
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,740
pretty pretty positive I'm in fact you
can

450
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,940
generator and key you can plug it in on
both devices

451
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm there's different APIs for the two
devices but they're actually

452
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,690
interoperable she can plug the same

453
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,980
you know chianti your you key input on
tier you know da plug it you can

454
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,810
spin up five or six ovum if you're
worried about having back up so that

455
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,610
hardware token you know put him in a
safety deposit box or something of that

456
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,658
nature

457
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,169
I and you get only open the database F

458
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:13,590
the key is place in USB port on in fact

459
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,949
with the more advanced features like the
Yuki has I

460
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,270
where you know the church and
responsible I there's actually a button

461
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,290
on the wiki

462
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,399
I'm he probably can't see it but there's
actually a

463
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,658
a touch sensor on it on you can program
you key in such a way that

464
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,909
in order to complete their challenge
response

465
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:35,070
I'm you have to touch it you know blanks
and you have to touch it for additional

466
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,850
security

467
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,949
I'm subsidies these kinda built-in
functions as well but they are

468
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,740
interoperable

469
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,100
it provides a very simple implementation
you can extract the key from the token

470
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,928
and and importantly I in this case

471
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,870
you know that there's different ways
that you could do this but one important

472
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,290
factors here is that were never really
disclosing anything to the hardware or

473
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:54,610
not

474
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,290
we're not technically trusting hardware
other than to generate

475
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,850
validates Mac I'm were never sending in
anything to the hardware that secret

476
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,060
from the database respected for not
giving not the hardware our password

477
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,320
you know our database past razor
encryption key were only giving at this

478
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,510
otherwise public data and that using the
response

479
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:20,010
so even if the hardware was tampered
with or you know somehow got swapped out

480
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,490
you know hate you happen to get a UBC
that stores every piece irv

481
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,860
I every message get sent into it for
later extraction

482
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,030
on you never exposing any special secret
data

483
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,200
to the hardware token momentum

484
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,639
so so that that's a fair concern and if
it did upwards euros

485
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:41,760
every time on than you would at worst

486
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,429
you'd still have the d up you know the
protection of the database encryption

487
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:46,810
key

488
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,899
so you'd you'd still have that operation
on it

489
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:53,780
so but yet if the hardware was tampered
with the point there was always out

490
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,658
putting you know

491
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,720
I static value then yeah you you would
lose the

492
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,750
the randomness of the database all hmm

493
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,450
here I where I'm certainly a and
actually we did that

494
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,669
as part of my you know part of the
project

495
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:14,540
mature kinda going through it I'm one
easy way

496
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,860
I we don't have it code into library now
but one easy way to do it

497
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,149
is to take I'm and verify when you flash
a token

498
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:24,678
you can actually you know you know what
vicki was at that point I'm

499
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,990
and you can execute age back operation
with a known good library like

500
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,679
open SSL and verify that you got the
same value out so so we we actually did

501
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,810
that during the development process in

502
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,879
its sides and wanted a revisions it sent
in the code there's a

503
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:43,060
I'll link that will publish get help for
your you

504
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,230
answer project yeah

505
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,869
yep absolutely I mean I I would probably
encourage you know that point

506
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:54,550
the the way that you could you verify
that you can't definitely verify it you

507
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,369
know that I will always return every
case

508
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,480
but at the point where you flash it
would be a good point to do that so

509
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,220
so both are these devices have a I'm
have an API

510
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,010
use a flash from and and at that point
you know you can

511
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,879
take whatever random data that you're
gonna put in flash it to the device

512
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:14,040
test that you can get a signature back
validate it with a

513
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,889
with third-party implementation no and
openness sour reach Mac come equipped or

514
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:18,889
whatever the case has

515
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm and verify that you're getting good
data out a bit

516
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,280
if it done at a later date decide to do
something bad you know

517
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,070
thats this treaty I so cons here

518
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,629
om I guess that the big the big ones

519
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,830
USB is required for this implementations
that does kinda limit it to platforms

520
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,080
where you have you know a USB port

521
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,699
and in place on it makes it difficult to
do it on like I was devices or something

522
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,590
of that nature

523
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,030
on hand in a lot of cases like Android
devices your mobile platforms

524
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,879
but we look at that as a con for right
now but this is sorta

525
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,939
you know an experimental feature
something or thinking about not done so.

526
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,730
something that

527
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,040
you know people are going to necessarily
going to today and a lot of these device

528
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,330
manufacturers are starting to go

529
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,990
you know to alternate interfaces you
knew but he has a

530
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,399
on they have a a token which can it

531
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,469
does a NFC so you know you have

532
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,450
how wireless option to do that challenge
response function and serve having it

533
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,619
plugged into

534
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,560
I you know plug into out the USB port so
this is something that

535
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,440
you know has the technology improves and
there's no additional options

536
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,500
on their available on the tokens and you
know that this stuff a mature

537
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,899
and and I'll probably more practical to
use this sort of

538
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,989
you know multi-factor on host now I'm

539
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,490
multi-factor encryption I scenario with
mobile devices

540
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,850
on the other cons really involve the
fact that you've got a lot of

541
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,040
additional code involved so its
complexity right there's custom code

542
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,810
that has to be implemented

543
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,280
i'm for the sequel safer side there's
call backs you know that actually do

544
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,820
that

545
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,689
the workout interacting with CE the
API's and then there's the API

546
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,210
dependencies themselves

547
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,720
Sodus again to give you an idea you know
to implement this for two different

548
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,550
functions

549
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,590
are two different hardware tokens you
need like the

550
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,000
to you because capi YouTube a cholo on

551
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,639
Yuki personalization API you need to da
plug

552
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,050
API he that has a dependency on open SSL

553
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,730
seem to have that in place they both
have dependencies

554
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,860
on live usb I and then

555
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,408
those have dependencies on at least on
the Mac on you know I okay

556
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:34,100
and and whatnot so you've got a pretty
steep

557
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,520
dependency chain assign you know
involved with everything related to

558
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,190
running at

559
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,490
once you get up and running and you know
you can take care that in an automated

560
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,740
build process

561
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,869
I'm but you know that there is a a
certain level of complexity that's

562
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,110
inherently involve with an

563
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,800
website adding Harbor token into the
mixer

564
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,629
some yell minor

565
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:58,580
on yet yes a while outside au Iowa Sen

566
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,310
and rates outside the mobile but they do
support Linux

567
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,000
a book both platforms for Linux support
Windows and sport Mac

568
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,429
suffer for any desktop you know
environment

569
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:12,629
I'm that you would choose to do this we
might have you know some highly

570
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:15,629
sensitive data that you want to put into
issue per se for database

571
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:19,350
on that this would be doable yen

572
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,379
her sums for your honor

573
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:26,550
or let you know um

574
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,418
yes there's NFC version for Android I
don't have a day

575
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,460
and i've seen it will be the key but on
that there is a NFC API for

576
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,610
for Android on and actually that there's
a couple

577
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,780
I sample applications that you call has
published

578
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,500
I think one that uses that won their NFC
tokens for encrypting your

579
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,869
OpenPGP keys I'm sits yes they have it
in their seats so it's definitely

580
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:52,810
something that is feasible

581
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,129
I am you know to to put into place but
not something that we did as as part of

582
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:58,330
this

583
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,860
experimental feature dishing

584
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,678
cool so that the

585
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,000
that pretty much covers with the with
the multi-factor there if anybody has

586
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,530
any question you have to take 'em

587
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,649
on we have more information up here
segal safer dotnet

588
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:18,549
is the website for seagal safer on as

589
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,990
is Nick mention right at the beginning
super saver's an open source project

590
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,549
I so you can go to get hard you can
check it out on all this

591
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,470
work related to the adaptive key
derivation is all on out

592
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,449
it's on a branch there called bf ass on
that relate to the virtual file system

593
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,509
that

594
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,810
we had to implement to store the

595
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,949
you deputy derivations but you can check
it out there and a similar state

596
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,009
kinda Ross you know sample code that we
use to I'm to do that multi-factor

597
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,970
encryption

598
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:50,569
on his is available out there as well
106 a for MFA

599
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,600
I repo any any questions or wrong

600
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,618
sure a I'll source our

601
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,150
0 for coasting out there

602
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,570
and i was thinkin girls are wassup

603
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,860
Hong overall I'm it is something yes

604
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,940
hard call yeah i i think if you look at
Tom

605
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,210
if you look at the MFA project from and
you can see how it works it's really

606
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,480
actually very simple

607
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,490
there's did that provider interface

608
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,319
in sickle safer essentially expose a
bunch call backs for common things that

609
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,690
new seduces like a

610
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,730
there's a key derivation call back you
know there's an encrypted data call back

611
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,310
there's a

612
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,320
you know here's a each Mac call back to
use for

613
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,630
for generating the max I'm on the pages
iron

614
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,470
and then yeah there's one in there for
for justice scan over

615
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,330
I R so permutation on and whatnot so

616
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,860
you can take that and hook into it so as
long as whatever token the you happen to

617
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,369
have

618
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,700
if I wouldn't even have to be a token if
you don't want to if you had if you want

619
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,710
to make something up then

620
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,780
xterm ok all you know to a you know

621
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,830
Remo call to something you know maybe
plugged in

622
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,480
plug into the device you an iPhone or
whatever the case is you could do it and

623
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,630
you suck into that

624
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,150
song is generating output on that kinda
diversifies the SOL

625
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,210
coming in I and changes that

626
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,640
then it would work with this approach so
it's very open for

627
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,960
other implementations and he kinda
because I need to see that kinda stuff

628
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,440
crop up a mean ideally

629
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,740
for tricycle safer is kinda past

630
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,879
I am its its half I

631
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,990
your business you know cuz we use in our
own software reason strap

632
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm we also license at other companies
you know it's a it's open source we have

633
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,710
commercial fishing stuff through

634
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,950
we license they would use part for it as
part of our core business but it's also

635
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,029
sort uva

636
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,619
apply for Murray experiment with ideas
me know like like this and if they start

637
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,160
to take off and people are interested in
it

638
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,660
I you know we we don't tend to focus on
it so it's really very much is like

639
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,660
requirement driven development for us
you know what what is their community

640
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,910
interested in

641
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,319
on man you know are people using it is
it is it

642
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,700
something that makes sense for practical
implementation and then we can take

643
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,649
these features an

644
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:10,250
are run through a friend and and they
stop being experiments on Saturday rail

645
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,410
sheesh going

646
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,480
