1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,259
pass for something coach period so

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,269
secure email secure password is what I'm
going to talk about

3
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:10,790
and for those who didn't attend passers
Kong

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,009
in also in 01 2012 we had

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,900
a Makis doubles from the invest in
Bookham in Germany

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,740
I he introduced the use of kittens in
your slides

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,169
essentially saying dost this talk all
the next couple slights are supposed to

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,550
be

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,970
EC to understand background information

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,720
added that this boring fierce nice
picture of a kid influence that

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,560
so that's you know that's the way to do
%uh new talks I'll in the mall

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,410
engaging to the audience use pictures
are kept in touch now

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,800
the thing he recites money many years
ago out some

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,290
undisclosed location in no way I was
working for a large company

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,940
I to me he had up guidelines on

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,180
doing classification of information we
have four levels

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,950
everything from this information can be
shared with other one to this

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,210
information is so friggin secret not
even the CEO was allowed to

19
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,710
have a look at it we also had

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,320
I in this company we actually had them a
in-house

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,148
a developed Outlook plugin so when you
clicked

22
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,170
the Sun button you will actually be
upset with the dialog box

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,679
box asking you what is the classic
classification London

24
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:26,609
for this he might the only thing the
plugin gotten did

25
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,309
of course mister in so other bees little
bit of information

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,560
into the email header saying that this
is classified you know like

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,710
open information in total information
secret top secret

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,678
what whatever you wanna call it we also
had a security policy

29
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:46,850
and that were being I'll you know be we
told people about this

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,309
and we said that well if the information
house

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,499
you know or trust cation level from you
know she plus a walk in going from

32
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:57,579
abc&d I see or higher

33
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,999
the hot to be and trip to the
information had to be inflicted

34
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:05,158
now hungering prepped that paper it's
come difficult

35
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,300
how'd you interrupts encrypt email

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,620
and that was a problem on mean told

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,950
all the employees you need to encrypt
your email me but we didn't have any

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,190
solution in place

39
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,290
she know if you wanted to fire anyone I
would prefer for and be very sick did

40
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,400
you sat on the cost right

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,680
information today yes okay well you're
fired because you don't have an

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,950
encryption solution for it

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,619
period so we sought to look into true so
we could use

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,220
to dream electrician and the problem of
course is that PGP an option to

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,160
everything else

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,160
as Frost I have seen in the market today
its

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
you're sure experience hell it's very
difficult to use

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,359
and I mean that in the context of both

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,090
a security professional but also for
normal you know normal human beings

50
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,540
they prefer to use outlook all whatever
they use a mic mail client

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,380
exactly that the way they do today they
don't they don't wanna

52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,609
and the changes in email client to you
know comply with security

53
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,260
because it's difficult a neat you need
to teach them how to do it

54
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,040
and why you want to encrypt email us not
something

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,359
so a we're also thinking about you don't

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,970
mean I mean do we have any classified
information and I

57
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,080
is actually coming into all leaving the
company

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,380
I which is highly classified do we have
that

59
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,730
I mean how we approach you know such
which we

60
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,739
with you we do have a fury but cummick
of elements

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,770
and we also means being with me we get a
lot of salt

62
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,810
to the your shirt I'll I'm use ability

63
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,700
perspective of security encryption make
lines and so on

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,440
so you note judy is simple risk analysis

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,820
I usually do my risk not just incredibly
EC way

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,100
so I just rock run this command at

67
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,220
the internet connection of a really
large company and essentially what I do

68
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,480
here is that I do not regret looking at

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,950
TCP Paul 25 which is SMTP traffic

70
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,609
standard email only for the world
password

71
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,070
in if I have a much I would be printed
out on the screen the entire oil

72
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,199
text line that contains a wealth
prosperity

73
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,639
and if you do dots internet gateway of
honey large company

74
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,120
a small company even all government
organization it's gonna be just like

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,539
a couple seconds before you see text
lines

76
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,860
flying over the line saying he s your
pack to

77
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,870
has your password here sponsored you
crack the whip rested his username

78
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,280
I'll your pass first on one single all
summing

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,780
judy judy risk analysis I had to do you
know networks sniffing for a couple

80
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,979
seconds and then I could go back and say

81
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,289
yes we do need some kind of human
infection

82
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,860
a place here because they're all tonsil
posture

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,039
spousal support passwords possible by

84
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,539
everyday in and out of this company

85
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,430
personal passersby being used by a place
for personal services

86
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,610
they are all employees receiving access
to extol system so we all depends on

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,569
I'll we have helped us transients within
the company lost something

88
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:18,610
something plaintext passwords to people
outside on station by email

89
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,819
here's poss requested here snuggling
this issue you select and if you need

90
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,430
any help just call us

91
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,550
so again looking into options on this

92
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,650
you can do and drug to encryption you
know like using PGP

93
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,498
you would have to generate your own she
on certificates how pasta repost race

94
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,039
%uh think protecting its

95
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,490
on the recipient of the summer about you
all the time meets the same thing

96
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,330
now initially what we want Joe Boyd that
because

97
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,188
me new it's gonna be use ability held
period

98
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,400
and the next thing you can do which is
not as good security issue to show 27

99
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,969
friction

100
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:59,539
you know like to make this encryption
happened transparently judy and her

101
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,240
church

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,259
my and this is

103
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,669
goes all the way back to about I was you
know

104
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,680
looking to descend back in 2001 2002

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,930
and some college sublime said hey we
have you considered

106
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,699
no deploying alcee for the 2007 stop
here to support for SMTP

107
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,199
who know that's one of the West's we
haven't looked into

108
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,569
and we did alcee for 2007 came in

109
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,689
2001 other person duration was

110
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,819
at $24.87 which came in 1998 if I
remember correctly

111
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:40,090
and eights opportunistic encryption
between two male some ice

112
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,419
eight strong truck parts you and your
show you know you will note not not

113
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,779
notice I think there's

114
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,460
you know there are no buttons to press
urs no change in that your mail client

115
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,498
nothing I you know it doesn't require
matching just are there no license to

116
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,930
the paper it's an Internet standards I
don't know competitors to dis

117
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,930
its of CNN's standard period

118
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,650
one of two things about this all see is
that also says that this is

119
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,448
opportunistic encryption it means tots

120
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,539
I want to send an email to you gel might
show up

121
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,808
do you support stop the Las the also
oversight

122
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:20,580
I have absolutely no clue what you're
talking about a done deal see requires

123
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,188
you to some the email

124
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:27,819
by plain text and you have to comply
without publicly on the Internet

125
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,629
that's the drawback of this law to light
it is in

126
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,009
are you know I started working tell me
and company and also with customers to

127
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,479
convince them to deploy

128
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,128
support for start E last on we would be

129
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,389
redeployed its I we did pretty sauced on
in the spring 2000

130
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,699
10 I was talking to a colleague of mine
a friend on a lot about as well

131
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,059
you know should be try to do a mopping
of well what is it

132
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:55,939
how well it's just so supported on Linux

133
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:59,589
so we test the tree nor 345,000 domains

134
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,289
other which up for Twitter 2001 the
region

135
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,628
I'll we did a report on the summer but
that's only in the region %uh sorry

136
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:07,490
about that

137
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,319
we found out approximately 16 percent of
all domains in all white

138
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,939
in 2010 had support for Softail us

139
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,860
but on I which so 2 percent which
supports not hear us

140
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,830
which was channel look good at all

141
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,878
we also discovered a small sample at the
Prime Minister's Office

142
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,969
Norway they had are she strolls

143
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,140
our report male appliance in place

144
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,240
and maybe you sing the default demo
stocks TLS or SSL Certificates

145
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,389
which is issued by Cisco 2620

146
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:43,959
so you know their prime minister has an
email for you and it makes our response

147
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,000
like hey and welcome to Just systems

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,810
and in you know in California and the US
and of course

149
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,920
this difficult had expired as well so

150
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,399
the biggest financial newspaper no way
really enjoyed

151
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,589
you know doing a story saying that the
Prime Minister's Office is using fake ID

152
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,060
and we also found that's up %uh
political left side

153
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,219
Socialist Party in in no way they

154
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,769
also hot stock hit us available on the
male solo

155
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,850
but yes it just took it had expired it
was a South

156
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,870
issued certificates and its most

157
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,310
shipped to the office of complications
otherwise simple affairs

158
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,638
a that's pretty good for socialist

159
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,980
up political Paul the oversight

160
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,449
and the mail server name was small been
soffit also your

161
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:37,439
right bitch i cos Guide to the galaxy
there you have it

162
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,839
we did made that we we actually did make
out some

163
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,949
nice headlines on on this one so just
keep on the forward in history to 22

164
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:49,410
earlier this spring %uh talk to your
friend of mine in

165
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,019
in also I noticed stanwyck and

166
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:56,519
we were having pizza and a sold-out I
said to him well

167
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,320
you know I really want more whose want
to move forward with forward with this

168
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,940
stock the less you know I'm home

169
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,139
I told myself back in you know like
2002-2003 that you know

170
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,100
on going on convinced entire world to
actually deploy support for this

171
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,930
Internet standard and alright come to
any kind of programming what so ever and

172
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,758
I really

173
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,300
really want a website that can do
automated testing of

174
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,880
domains in a very easy way to see if
they have sake let's support

175
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,449
I want to tell me if that's not enough
support is actually configured correctly

176
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,139
almost so he created stop the last
official

177
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,019
that is absolutely free to to use that
you just are

178
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,339
got crop plants XR I'll give it right
now

179
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,389
I it looks like this is pretty sick just
country an Amicon

180
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,889
domain name like and they say don't go
bust much trouble you know

181
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:49,750
you know not to give any specific
examples you try to call

182
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,190
following a tough to hold I R and have a
look at the results

183
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,899
on his fault a narrow it down completely
random

184
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,230
are Sokaluk such a system she I'll in

185
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,740
chairman I'll we are using a grating
school does essentially based on the

186
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,329
grading

187
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,800
a system used by Qantas nest celebs now
that really cockpit run transfer into

188
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,389
the world

189
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,190
of start TLS security big differences
between

190
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,209
you know mandatory HTTPS encryption

191
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,630
on opportunistic SMTP encryption but
still

192
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,839
we are you saying that to grade systems

193
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,769
is also interesting to see that a lot of
rentals ok I like Cisco with our report

194
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:29,970
appliance and also

195
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,089
Barracuda Networks 2.0 also been talking
to they do not support your loss

196
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:37,670
want the 1.1 or 1.2

197
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,769
they essentially give you as a sub
Russian to

198
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,819
the ocean three anti-dust Russian one
supports period

199
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,170
about good on that works have promised
me doubt they will look

200
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,660
into it and maybe sometime

201
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,360
within the end of this year they will
have to get us 1.1 1.2 support

202
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,449
so we need to calm winds aloft

203
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,930
companies still to do this properly

204
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,279
and also for cycles which supports this
also discussion

205
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,379
going on with lots of people especially
on the I

206
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,850
I tried something out my emails to
postfix you church mailing list

207
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,980
and did big discussion s

208
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,649
no matter what which Cyprus which we
support

209
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:25,350
Anne cycle sweet will be better than
plain text

210
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,649
that's what the pasta X you sheesh
people will tell you

211
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:35,290
my opinion you know it's okay with for
Tippett dusts exporting corruption using

212
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,250
asses on

213
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,660
rush into in my will that's really not
good

214
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,319
encryption anymore so I you know my
recommendation

215
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,990
I would say that we should not deploy a
sudden rush into

216
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,149
I exception us aspects of the force of
the law. support myself

217
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:54,389
us so that I you know I just you know
headed out into the world

218
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,850
Coast weather and said hey baby crib if
us chris also going out ACLU

219
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,190
but you should have a look at this I'll
be also called the

220
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,709
out top 1 million website lists from an
Excel

221
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,800
and then be scripted to run or through
all of them

222
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
on collector Schultz so we could just a
test section can

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,250
we look at the statistics on the site
aswell

224
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,470
and I really really hope it out to point
out the Google a

225
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,560
transparency report because they are now

226
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,000
have numbers on which domains at

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,490
all sending and receiving mails from
Google Mail

228
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,759
you sing start your ass and a source

229
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,089
I've seen from your fast an especially
from Chris of all %uh

230
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,149
ACLU they are really getting

231
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,889
on morning two words companies who
doesn't have stock enough support yeps

232
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,000
and I'm really really happy to see that
happening so essentially what we have

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,639
done

234
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
since 2002 2003 is tots

235
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,699
today I would say that

236
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,990
tense hundreds of millions of emails
every day

237
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,699
are now being accepted while in transit
already interrupt

238
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,849
I'm just a couple months ago most of
them with actually

239
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,350
goal unexpected and that's a massive

240
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,459
moves to works better security and
better privacy

241
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,729
now justice opportu up domestic
encryption and I'm the one who can do

242
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,730
simple man in the middle attacks can
strip away

243
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,269
the one line from to responding so what
that says yes I do support stop the last

244
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,329
and you to strip the way that one single
line you will have don't rated yet

245
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,050
auctioned

246
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,920
to do the entire I Metro using plain
text

247
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,259
which is not good so in the future

248
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,750
well we will see is essentially this its

249
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,290
I'm at the moment no it's not ATF trough
and its

250
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,579
author by Victor dick do called me and a
few ice

251
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,719
a known from the prospects universe

252
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,990
and with local issue is to use dainty
Lacson

253
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,170
use DNS sec to

254
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,170
make it are a lot more robust it's us

255
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,800
new as you can read her I mean this memo
describes don't read which is a protocol

256
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,079
for SMTP transport security between my
transfer agents

257
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,689
pay somebody in the space of the cation
name entities dainty and I say

258
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:17,879
DS recalled read the IETF draft it's
good its long

259
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,689
and it's really explanatory on this one
now the thing is

260
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,959
to deploy DNS I can to deploy all this
it's gonna take a lot of talking

261
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,378
many many years into the future bit
before this happens

262
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,930
to top level domain and always will I'll
adopt and all haven't pinned

263
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,508
the in a sec signed yet so he sexually
you can't deploy this in no way

264
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,019
yet the same applies to most countries
or around the world

265
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,509
and because I'm that's I'm also really
happy to say that we have your

266
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,560
from your fast I'm should go talk later
today on track to

resistant

268
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,519
just tough to all to I can be taxed with
the

269

stock kill us ugly well project I'm
really happy to have him here

properly and have things set up right

281
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,670
me know that although still doesn't
support salty less yachts

282
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,719
and they're also that haven't really
configure it at you know

283
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,810
us appropriate that you know appease

284
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,888
I would like to see them to its I

white house but you know there also

286
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,819
gotten yeah should be the same

287
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,829
government agencies they have some work
to do a

288
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,928
I without doubt around wells

289
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,309
I am but no the way that's especially
EFSF an ACLU all

290
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,899
putting pressure on this in you ask you
know it's its

291
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,929
I'm really happy to see that's the
happening here

292
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,620
I am I can also tell you that I'm
working with the Norwegian government

293
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,739
in the Norwegian government to sustain
our session body fall

294
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,230
about you know making the government
administration in Norway

295
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,529
be completely digital move away from
papal and sending out letters in in

296
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,520
normal mice to people

297
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,080
and I've been working with them now for
approximately two years

298
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,320
and I was hoping that they would
actually

299
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,350
say that's we recommends

300
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,668
and will prefer RC for the 2007

301
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,080
to become a standard for all government
agencies in Norway

302
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,250
everybody should use it period they
haven't made a decision yet it's

303
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,000
I i'm seriously hoping they will make
that decision

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,299
sometime during but this fall I before
Christmas

305
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:17,510
and if they do I think Norway will be
the very first government in the world

306
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,760
saying really recommends to you start
your last

307
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,520
for encrypting out shortly all-male
going in and out of

308
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,850
on in the region government body period
in

309
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,590
um first just her doc quick thing %ah

310
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,320
on okay to get to get around the
opportunities opportunistic

311
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,240
optionality a bit you can use port 587

312
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,659
which requires %uh starkey last arm

313
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:48,720
in but up their problem is you get there
are even fewer people and companies have

314
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,159
reporting outside

315
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,529
um I if you not also looking at poppin
I'm ap

316
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:59,320
in this picture you're losing a huge
amount

317
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,330
we've seen lotsa people's passwords
stolen

318
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,149
because they're ISP's email system

319
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,090
is entirely in I unencrypted a lot of
people using

320
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,100
for cable companies email or whatever

321
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,779
palm usually I would do 45 to 60 minutes

322
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,390
talk and then I will show you a diagram
of all the

323
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,260
absolutely all Internet shows provide us
pretty much that operates in all why

324
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,309
and their current status what's not in
us and also with

325
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,190
SSL up TLS and started a support for
both

326
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,179
pop and I'm out its it the numbers look
good

327
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,419
but yes and that's also one of thing I'm
talking to I know about

328
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,549
whether we should all sorry implement in
this stop the last of the info

329
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:49,820
Sykes if we'd should also die fight Paul

330
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,220
and the I'm not so awesome the sources
as well we started with SMTP

331
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,900
so to request for actually get

332
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,230
I'm that I'm yeah I mean they've taught
him a question speaking

333
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,029
yep Ocala FL process

334
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:10,549
saw I'm Chris Wood ACLU complex one
highest

335
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:14,850
size want everyone to understand how
important this work is and how

336
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,049
how much of a change we've seen in the
last six to nine months

337
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,770
and and having the start the Los the
info web site

338
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,730
has really been really really powerful
and getting that change because it's

339
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,549
something

340
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,059
it allows up those of us who do the
harassment side of things

341
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,520
hope to have a simple URL but we can
include in the email

342
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,149
I don't talk to the technical teams the
company's I talk to the lawyers

343
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:42,330
ripe threaten companies and by having a
simple you're all that I can include in

344
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,949
the email that shows the company

345
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,559
getting an axe core that's really really
pop one so

346
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,379
the website that you've done thank you's
so much for your work

347
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,600
mean this this is making passive BOC
surveillance

348
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
way more expensive and you know there
are still a number

349
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,408
really big providers the United States
were holding out Cox

350
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,480
our charter horizon AT&T

351
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,510
these are the the biggest US providers
the rest on doing it

352
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,120
and then as you said a number of
government agencies but we will

353
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,939
bully them to a hundred percent
eventually and this website is really

354
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,590
met making everything possible to thank
you for your hard work

355
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,899
who but on

356
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:29,949
okay perhaps apartments before becoming
I'll be around so we can discuss more

357
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,179
yeah okay

358
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,659
a partial mark short break and
production
