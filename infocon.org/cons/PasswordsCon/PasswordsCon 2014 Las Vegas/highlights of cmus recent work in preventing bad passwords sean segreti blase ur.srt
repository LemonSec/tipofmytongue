1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:05,600
and Britain report yep

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,809
okay so okay so

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,919
hell we have out to young jump month
that are currently PhD students

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,130
add comment email and personally am
along with

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,140
a several other people have been trying
for a long time

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,820
in a way to you know get hold of coming
amount because they have done some

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,560
outstanding work into password research
and

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,829
a couple of the paper said that have
been released earlier from CMU

9
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:36,280
also came us I would say a big office
priced

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,050
to money office in Indy crazy Patrick
community around the world

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,010
and finally I got in touch with them and
a subpoena to choke off pressed patience

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:45,300
and

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,839
I was ecstatic for Tots so

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,100
with that introduction I can just say
you know

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,489
good luck guys i'm looking for to this
one so begot

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,949
on thanks very much

17
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:03,539
air up so good afternoon I'm blazer

18
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,900
and ready ever representing our group

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,119
at at Carnegie Mellon University and
talking about continuing quest for

20
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,580
securing useful passwords

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,140
then we'd like to take questions at the
end that's okay I'm you might notice

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,790
that a

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,960
you know is Julia mention this morning
I'm normal people don't wear passwords a

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,600
parallel

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,070
yet here we are with our official
passwords highs

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,630
is our them among the most common
passwords in iraqi 0 and

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,030
five-story at Wendy's has originally
made and

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,689
a substring a password is a

29
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,589
so

30
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,000
so I not ours I

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,460
alright grayish parents I think

32
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,408
I don't have to convince many of us in
this room that when left to their own

33
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,299
devices

34
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,860
users tend to make not very good
passwords right so how the system ans de

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,640
lips

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,119
well the current state of affairs is
that for the most part system has come

37
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,200
up with a buncha

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,329
restrictions that say I hate you must do
the following:

39
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,949
and that's how I hope you get the
passwords and what results from this

40
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,949
unfortunately

41
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,589
is not the passwords its number one
users who annoyed that we have to do all

42
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,430
these things

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,790
and number to: dumb passwords that now
meet these requirements

44
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,329
I Sohar research group has for the last
few years

45
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,959
and trying to find ways to help users
create better passwords

46
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,200
we have two big goals in this project
one is that we noticed coming into the

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,920
project

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,230
that a lot of the guys I passwords was
based on

49
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,340
into a share and or are you best guesses
about what people dead

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,370
I'm so what we decide to do is approach
it mainly it with

51
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,050
controlled scientific experiments as
applying scientific method

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,660
to pass earth research number till is
you know

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,799
me knows that there's a group a lot of
groups doing really great security

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,989
working passwords

55
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,129
and snow half a group during usability
working passwords

56
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,109
and not that many groups doing things
that are really at the intersection of

57
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,480
these

58
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,859
so we went to consider but security and
usability a pass for its

59
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,150
as primary goals so we have a couple
metrics to measure password security but

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,060
our primary

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,900
method is week of disability and we got
time to go into detail on all a bit

62
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,140
up but we can assert from our past work
that disability

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,679
is a better representation a password
strength over something like entropy

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,370
so disability simply put is how many
guesses

65
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,080
I would be required given some guessing
algorithm in some input for that

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,500
dictionaries training data probabilistic
models

67
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,450
a mangling rules how many guesses would
require two yes a password

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,679
um and disability has a nice property
that its independent a passing and yet

69
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,480
still linked to crack in wartime

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,929
so you'd given a disability plot you can
I get a good idea how long something

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,430
with crack given your hardware in hash
used

72
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,049
I'm and we calculate disability

73
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,010
primarily by using the probabilistic
context-free grammar proposed by we're

74
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,620
at all

75
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,879
from for state on but in our ongoing
work we also do other

76
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,018
methods as well so where dole's PC 8g

77
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,829
I am basically works by taking in
training data and from the training did

78
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,239
learn structures and if your house cat
user it's the same thing as a mask

79
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,979
and then it did outputs guesses based on
probability of the structures

80
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,669
and the strings that sees that can be
combined to meet those structures

81
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,770
and the reasons we do this we have a
couple so first off

82
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,000
in academic literature this concert at
the state-of-the-art approach

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,470
in terms of efficiency in guessing
second we've made our own improvements

84
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,240
to it

85
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,639
I'll share some with them later third

86
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,430
other approaches like John the Ripper
and has cat require fair amount of

87
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,360
heuristics

88
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,610
so if you wanna do an optimal tackle
John or perhaps get you really have to

89
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,650
know what you're doing

90
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,770
and who's to say that we do and forth

91
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,650
we've implemented I what we call a
lookup table so we can talk league s

92
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,120
ability without having to output a
gazillion

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,820
I'll incorrect guesses before reaching
the correct guess

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,440
so here's a just billy pot like some
either about.com

95
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,490
each color represents a different
password set x-axis how many guesses

96
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,310
and y-axis is what portion of the
password set was cracked so you can look

97
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,120
at it and say

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,440
pick a point find a guest number on the
x-axis a

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,150
then go to the Y axis and see how many
were were just at that point factor in

100
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,719
your hashing algorithm have good idea
how long it would take

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,620
to crack with this given guessing over
them

102
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,110
and so for usability metrics said the
region surf these passwords we have a

103
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,300
number of them

104
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,500
on something we get through automatic
methods like go on art

105
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,139
on our experiment servers we can
automatically record attempt information

106
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,270
our timing data

107
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,490
and then other things we have to just
directly ask people through surveys our

108
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,669
interview such as

109
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,698
was your password difficult to create
difficult to remember did you write it

110
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,410
down

111
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,759
how did you write it down and we use
these metrics to try to identify traits

112
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,720
they can make the whole password
experience is better for the average

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,860
person

114
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,720
so where do we get the passwords that we
study on n short answer

115
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,000
is from a lot of different places
depending on the analysis for using

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,350
so we done some analyses using the weak
passwords that's that

117
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,830
yeah many people in this room have also
studied we also have looked at high

118
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,400
value passwords from a university I'll
be telling you about that in a moment

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,729
on but then the others like things we
want to do where we

120
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,090
want people to create passwords under
certain conditions certain requirements

121
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,679
your

122
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,960
certain circumstances and for those we
actually have to have people create

123
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,520
studies

124
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,948
and we've done but online studies in lab
studies I'm out primarily be talking

125
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:37,199
about

126
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,280
online studies up today up and so you
might wonder what what why are we doing

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,349
these like online studies now there's
all these large past three weeks with

128
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,400
real passwords

129
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,520
why are we getting these these fake
passports the problem with a lot of

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,190
these weeks

131
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,550
on is that you know there's not
information for the most part about

132
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,660
usability

133
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,819
and these leaks I mean that's one of our
primary questions

134
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,740
we also can't can't create controlled
experiments to compare different

135
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,599
techniques

136
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,729
so we can you go back and say like the
rocky week

137
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,050
yeah have people do this half the people
do this and similarly

138
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,650
we can go to a company say I we have
this crazy idea no evidence that works

139
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,659
let's try it out

140
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,880
have a third to the people your company
do this cellular

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,610
for that for the help the first step in
the is this the year use these online

142
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,500
studies in lab studies

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,289
K a lot I these online experiments I
we've used Amazon's Mechanical Turk

144
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,030
outsourcing service

145
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,138
on its upper kind of the at the short
version A

146
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,190
well protocol like this might look like
we have purchased spence

147
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,509
a yep let you do a roleplay imagining
that the primary email account

148
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,580
has asked them to change their password
I mean that you can create a password

149
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,159
and we record keystrokes and all kinds
of information about what they're doing

150
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,870
then answer survey questions about the
pastor creation experienced in the past

151
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,330
with a dish created

152
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,680
I mean we have them tight we caught a
pass for Titanic en

153
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,889
than two days later we send them an
email asking the comeback

154
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,669
and again trying to type in your
password an answer survey questions

155
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,909
about how they

156
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,039
remembered or as the case may be fail to
remember their password

157
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,080
and South real this I mechanism

158
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,318
at this point we've stayed over 30,000
protests pants I'm

159
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,780
making passwords with rich supporting
data everything from surveys to

160
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,940
keystrokes

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,520
right and sell your many if you're
probably asking the question I got

162
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,568
how legit and how real are these
passwords

163
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,550
and we asked ourselves the same question
so we did a study where be

164
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,750
among other things compared these types
of passers reflecting on my studies

165
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,080
to those in years at our university
Carnegie Mellon and as we study 25,000

166
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,560
real high value passwords

167
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,848
from the CMU sign on system single
sign-on system

168
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,700
representing all the faculty staff and
students are active at the time

169
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,140
as a contextual data as a access logs on

170
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,500
detailed demographics which are the
University clocks are quite accurate

171
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,529
I'm a surveyor spots and so going into
this project we had

172
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,779
one question we have to answer first
which is how do we access this real data

173
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,120
responsibly we also had to questions
here

174
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,630
two main questions we need to answer
first as I alluded to earlier

175
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,070
has similarities and tear passwords to
real passwords

176
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,320
and also what factors seem to correlate
to pass restrict

177
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,940
South reach of the story accessing real
they are responsible a

178
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,580
I'm so the single sign-on system MSN its
yet this password grants access

179
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,080
to that user's email account financial
information

180
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,209
I'm your financial aid for students
payroll for employees

181
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,510
on grades same thing registration

182
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,810
%uh information with their senior health
center X at Rs 0

183
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,518
we don't want to take this lightly on
and so is the result

184
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,380
yet we never saw plaintext passwords but
are coded

185
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,750
at this point I'm sure some alarm bells
are going up to his room I kept

186
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,550
surely do not mean plaintext passwords
surely you mean

187
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,339
salted and hash with the computation
expensive hashing algorithm past

188
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,709
but now we actually do in plaintext
passwords so when we started this

189
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,869
I study a couple years ago you know side

190
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,519
working with the ISO at CMU we found out
that passwords were reversibly encrypt

191
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,959
it

192
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,229
on and the system that the easiest I
mean this was

193
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,470
not a bug this was a feature because
according to all

194
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,010
they have the vendors sold in the system
at this would allow them to interface

195
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,390
with legacy systems

196
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,949
that would be able to support her
breasts and so than when

197
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,649
we had discussions with them said you
know you probably don't wanna do this

198
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:24,730
they agreed they went around shopping
for a new system and all the vendors

199
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,630
they talk to

200
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,180
said no we actually do the same thing so
that there yet they said strangest

201
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,390
transition away from this but that the
role their own system

202
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,380
um yeah and so you know so we you said
but we have all these plain text you

203
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,680
password for every user at CMU on let's
write code to analyze them

204
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,959
and I'll put all kinds via analyses the
questions we like to ask

205
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,290
I'm so what we did is we wrote code I'm

206
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,949
sent it over to the ISO personnel they
manually that a cut keiko died at

207
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm yet they got their own systems I'm

208
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,050
that attacks and solve everything from
source on

209
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,180
never connected machine to the Internet
I'm ran the code

210
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,910
printed out the output i'm toria prevent
covert channels

211
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,019
and they had my expected and
hand-delivered the output

212
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,740
a bar now says trust on paper and so we
took these

213
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,990
you know kind extraordinary steps
because we didn't want to you

214
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,560
cause security issues for users at CMU

215
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,160
at on inside out this was a lot of work
this project actually

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,640
went on for over three years contact you
know what the conversations

217
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,660
with lawyers and everything at along the
way right

218
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,029
and so we want to ask well yell if we
compared Israel CMU passwords

219
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,209
the password that we can get with much
less effort

220
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:42,089
said things like yep passwords from rock
your Yahoo all the other young big leaks

221
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,149
I'm in what we call conforming subsets
that is if we take all the passage from

222
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:46,800
these leaks

223
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,800
that would have been valid under CMU's
Patrick opposition posse

224
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,990
which requires all four character
classes dictionary check

225
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,000
an eight or more characters on separate
compare those

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,410
to the real seen your passwords and we
also compare the password that we're

227
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,810
collecting from M Turk

228
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,869
I'm to the Israel see new passwords yeah
which

229
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,950
it seems to be kinda be a low-cost
equivalent staying passwords

230
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,910
that best better matches on these real
passwords

231
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,370
we looked at a number of metrics for
comparison we look at the composition

232
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,740
structure is on other passwords

233
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,690
look at the frequency distribution at
different passwords I me to the SATs

234
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:28,709
and we also looked at yes ability yet
against I at the PCG Albert

235
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,050
and so short answers taking on metrics
into account

236
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,339
the enter password ended up closer to
real passwords

237
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,350
then he's conforming subset that weak
data and that is yet

238
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,740
they weren't perfect you know there's
there some junk in there but for the

239
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,540
kinds of questions we're asking

240
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,730
I'm they turn out to be out really
useful for research

241
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,410
and a pretty good proxy for real search

242
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,930
to give you a sense of these kinds of
things if we look at yes some

243
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,170
characteristics a password laying I'm
number digits number assembles

244
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,149
and we compare in black the real CMU
passwords

245
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,100
i'm too ingrained the empty their
passwords that you know were closest

246
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,670
to it comment opposition policy I'm and
then to

247
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,399
a whole bunch of conforming
substantively passwords and then

248
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,440
either enter password with different
composition policies

249
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,820
I'm and your it's just a couple other
than we had a whole bunch of

250
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,910
these kinds metrics I'm again across
these

251
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,990
the answer passwords most closely
resembled the composition

252
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,290
these I real CMU passwords

253
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,680
track we also looks at you have to guess
ability said this black line

254
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,790
I'm is you represents the CMU passwords

255
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,050
again I guess number on the axe access
analog scale

256
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,729
as how many guesses to take this I am
pastor tracking algorithm to get to that

257
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,630
password

258
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,949
and y-axis we have the proportion of
this Sat that was guest by that point

259
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:55,519
so that is here higher-up our worst
passwords

260
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,350
lowered our on air in the bottom right
corner are stronger passwords

261
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,050
itself we compare for instance on doctor
and strap for

262
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,990
conforming subsets we find these are
actually pretty easy to guess

263
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,300
but no that these are leaks were
actually based on

264
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,099
cracked passwords on you know that that
makes for a I hatched

265
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,649
right so you're basically there these
passwords that were easy that never

266
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,420
cracked

267
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,339
were again able to be cracked at
reasonably high rate on

268
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,750
right so we also looked at on yep rocky
UCSD and

269
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,649
ya who leaks I'm and rocky week extract
the real CMU

270
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,720
passwords closely that is for those
passwords iraqi 0

271
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,820
the small fraction that would have been
ballots in your passwords whereas the

272
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,500
others

273
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,510
night I'm not as much so it's kinda
along all these different

274
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,769
elite subset had a mixed bag sometimes
it's close

275
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,300
sometimes it's not and it's hard to know
in advance weather will be

276
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,949
so then the green lines are the two
different sets a

277
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:57,290
passwords we collected from M Turk on
one simulating the look and feel a teeny

278
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,910
site

279
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,100
and one not doing so but with the same
composition posse

280
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,990
and we found again they're not quite %uh
me up hijacking a super super closely

281
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,079
but the relatively close on and for you
know

282
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,310
that purposes were using them for you
know it's pretty much good enough

283
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,399
etc so then we also investigated how
different characteristics but

284
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,959
demographics and those are the passwords

285
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,388
correlated with password strength: and I
guess a billy

286
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,480
I'm so as you might guess you someplace
with that things like digits in special

287
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,560
characters

288
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,569
where their digits were at the end
verses where their digits were spread

289
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,050
out

290
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,019
or I stuck in the middle of the password
somewhere I miss Indy was correlated

291
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,300
does is easier to guest pass for three
digit symbols were at the apt

292
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,540
am going into the project we had assumed
that yep

293
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,170
a gender role at the University thing
like is a person s

294
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,240
back to remember staffer student I would
correlate with password strength:

295
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,630
we didn't find it to be the case there
are no significant correlations their

296
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,279
however the Department affiliation seen
you did correlate with passwords track

297
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,079
I'm so these these different these
different line 32 the represents a

298
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,319
different academic department at CMU

299
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,740
so you notice the green passwords were
the easiest to gas

300
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,259
I'm and blue navy blue passwords where
the hardest and is actually out

301
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,589
quite a bit I am difference at one point
eight times a

302
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,130
moreover cracked in a green set the
first spot a guessing game

303
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,209
I am said that the navy blue line the
strongest passwords

304
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,050
which department do you think that is
horse liberal who

305
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,670
you know in a each years

306
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,360
drugs passwords the strongest
grass-roots yeah

307
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,259
also that the blue in the strongest Pat
strongest password for the computer

308
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,000
scientists

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,570
the weakest the weakest after the Green
Line is so we're yep

310
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,870
to business school yes

311
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,829
the dozen people were putting in charge

312
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:57,138
week on the SL

313
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,550
I'm tits we basically been damn
different groups

314
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,079
together it's been what have you know
and analysis that says

315
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,589
the one russian studies major whose yup
duel with computer science

316
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,980
this is the characters for their
password so some other kinds analyses

317
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,740
got kinda been together Antalya
humanities

318
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,039
K okay so let me remind you our
overarching goal of all this which is to

319
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,689
improve the password experience for the
average user

320
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:29,460
and we started out on this track by
considering passer composition policies

321
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,620
on sis work started back in 2010-2011

322
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,219
by cokie by collecting passwords under
controlled conditions

323
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,250
so each condition that we collect it had
a different password for some policy

324
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,299
analysts it here

325
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,470
basically it's pretty simple just that a
character like check

326
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,679
com paid a comprehensive a same is a
subset a basic cable requires all four

327
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,780
character classes and a dictionary check

328
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,450
basic 16 is just an extension basic a
with 16 characters

329
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,789
the blacklist conditions there were
three easy medium and hard with

330
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,480
increasing blacklist sides

331
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,260
an addition a character like check a
dictionary just met that

332
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,299
8 and there's no such thing inside the
password that was found in the

333
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:05,950
dictionary

334
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,650
in a dictionary and dictionary it was
the exact same one in copy

335
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,429
up so we collected a whole bunch these
passwords and a cracked them

336
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,539
and as you can see is big difference in
cracking resistance with for example

337
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,990
basic 16 performing five times better
than basic a tear gas cutoff switches

338
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,559
around that want to extend to the 13

339
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,090
I'm so now we begin a process of
elimination try to find the best ones

340
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,168
on so if we take the top three by
strength which are

341
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:35,919
blacklist our comprehensive eight basic
16 and then also consider in the

342
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,640
usability

343
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,820
metrics that we collected well turns out
we can eliminate

344
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,600
act blacklist hard almost immediately
because I'm

345
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,750
it was almost impossible use in is
interesting because

346
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,730
you know if you think about it if you
make a password that it feels the

347
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,770
blacklist chest

348
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,520
check your you're kinda lost you know
what to do basically just try harder

349
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,870
I'm so a lot worker dispense had trouble
with this I'm

350
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,389
however from here we can we can take
note that basic 16 while it perform the

351
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,950
best in the long term

352
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,970
perform fairly poorly in the beginning
on with

353
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,530
it's a it's its contender comprehensive
8

354
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,160
performing much better in the beginning
and he didn't this is because you know

355
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,260
a you can't stop people from making
really bad passwords

356
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,010
such as password password baseball
baseball and and they still pass that

357
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,460
basic 16 check I'm

358
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,570
so another thing we learn from this is
that that the longer passers basic 16

359
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,678
was across the board more usable than

360
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,660
a shorter more complex password policy
as it was easier to create

361
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,559
easier to remember written down less and
our users

362
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,660
expressed more positive sentiment about
the whole experience

363
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,799
so takeaways from this is that longer
password told American terms a pass for

364
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,139
competition policy even if they're
simpler than

365
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,370
shorter password policy on however if we
can eliminate these

366
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,330
these few out liars in the beginning
that urges really bad password an easy

367
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,100
to guess

368
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,809
they may be wrong to something so we
took this and we we did another study

369
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:05,230
where

370
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,400
we explore the area around basis 16
trying to eliminate that

371
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,559
those easy to guest password right in
the very beginning at guessing

372
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,470
and we did this by taking severn longer
than usual password policies and

373
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,440
compared them to copy

374
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,280
the policies we came up with for basic
12 16 and 20 per self-explanatory

375
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,100
copy as a baseline to work for 12 into
work sixteen which basically means two

376
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,449
strings about offers separated by non up
in the middle

377
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,070
and three class 12&3 class 16 which just
means you have to have at least three

378
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,899
character classes and then passed the
lecture ok

379
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,070
now before we cracked these collective
password we had to make some

380
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,158
improvements to the PC if she approach

381
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,000
I we made three major improvements in
this part up for stuff we

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,860
we tokin eyes long strings that is a
week we

383
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,330
break long strings of a single character
class into words and we do this by

384
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,250
analyzing

385
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,650
Google's web corpus for and Gramps and
this means instead of treating the

386
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,630
terminals in a in the grammar as just
strings a comic character class now

387
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,140
they're

388
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,650
actual words the second for me we did is

389
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,020
we we now sort strings by their
probabilities

390
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,580
in the training data and this is
important because in the original

391
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,490
the CFG approach I'll all strings are
treated with uniform probability

392
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,169
ma'am and a side effect doing this is
that it greatly increased our

393
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:27,210
computation overhead in terms of time
and memory

394
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,450
on and we can mitigate this by
quantizing are probabilities to

395
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,720
increase the look up speed at a small
cost have

396
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,299
guessing accuracy so as you can see here
there's

397
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,940
quite a big difference again in in the
guessing resistance for each of these

398
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,880
policies

399
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,760
and we apply the same process of
elimination try to find a good ones

400
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,280
so if you consider the top the top five
here

401
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,389
3 cost well basic 16 and 22 word 16th
request 16

402
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,080
well we can once again eliminate basic
16 a basic 20 right off the bat because

403
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,210
they still exhibit

404
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,770
that poor resistance a guessing early
that is there's the same

405
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,360
easy to get passwords that the policy
doesn't prevent

406
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,799
and that leaves us with three
front-runners for class 12 to work

407
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,490
sixteen

408
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,850
and three class 16 I'm so now we
consider the usability of these

409
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,330
so in this chart I'm you can look at the
green boxes meaning that they were

410
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,080
better at copy and that particular
metric and the reddest

411
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,770
significantly worse on if you look at
the three across the bottom

412
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,250
which are three front-runners two were
$16.3 class 12&3 class 16

413
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,750
is clear the two-word 16:03 class 12 are
again across the board

414
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,640
better than copy in terms of usability
and better than copy

415
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,679
in terms of security on at this point we
decided to eliminate three classics team

416
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,809
from our search because

417
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:49,840
forty percent of our participants
thought that it was too difficult to

418
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,309
create

419
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:56,710
and had a significantly longer entry
time

420
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,850
so we recommend a sys admins that you
choose one of these two policies are

421
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,959
three cost well over to work sixteen

422
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,580
and it comes with a slight trade-offs
three class 12 it'll be easier to create

423
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,789
for users to be

424
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:12,260
less confused in the beginning I'm and
to work sixteen shows a little bit

425
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,000
stronger

426
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,789
i guess im resistance n and it's up to
you as the sysadmin to decide which one

427
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:17,150
is

428
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,480
is up you know right for your
environment

429
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,669
so we haven't just been studying
password composition policies

430
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,820
so for a play button up wherever
whenever other studies we let that

431
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,320
password strength: years

432
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,270
yeah these kinds of things you find all
over the web I'm and said yet what what

433
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,730
effect do they have

434
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,970
any I may also be noted the other come
in all kinds a

435
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,929
shapes and sizes and colors well which
design aspects

436
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,000
if any matter and so we did on

437
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,150
yeah made a baseline meter Armenia and

438
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,350
happen Cape aided by that deferred
visually from it

439
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,250
so we had a segmented bar one that
didn't change colors always green

440
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,330
really tiny meet a really big me there
and took away suggestions

441
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,559
took away the bar arm and we also said
well

442
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,230
but if we take away the bar and replace
it with something else something a

443
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,340
little bit sillier

444
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,289
and so we made a dancing bunny meter on
and where the stronger your password

445
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:18,470
the faster Bugs Bunny dances they answer
to and yes sir going on air

446
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,630
he really gets going yeah

447
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,720
yeah and so we also tried a bunch where
that where look just like this baseline

448
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,620
meter recreated

449
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,689
but differed in the way this Court
passwords and that the way to SCORELAND

450
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,150
was

451
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,970
in two cases much more stringently and
one we gave half to score that we

452
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,740
normally would

453
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,450
and the other one third of the score we
normally would and then to others

454
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,190
we try pushing people towards a a
particular Patrick opposition policy

455
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,480
and what we found across the is is that
meters actually do make a difference

456
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,770
both in the composition of passwords
things like

457
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,960
the lank the inclusion other Mia
different character classes where

458
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,070
they're putting them

459
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,918
I and also and this I guess ability is
security

460
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,120
I guess is getting a check attack we
found that all meters with visual

461
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,469
components and tax

462
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,600
help users create passwords up create
better passwords

463
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,469
on however size didn't matter much color
didn't matter much whether it was a bar

464
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,799
money didn't matter much as long as
there are some feedback I'm a

465
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,070
Mia help people we also found at the
stringency of the scoring algorithm

466
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,970
matters quite a lot up so that the 1i
gave half the score

467
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,750
up for dispense made much longer and in
the and

468
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,940
harder to guess passwords on and our
working hypothesis here is that

469
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,990
no one wants to be bad so if their
passwords I spectators tell I am

470
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,419
your passwords bad kept trying and tell
their at least okay

471
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,720
right I'm and but this is this has its
limits however there as the ash

472
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,460
the really stringent wanna give a third
of the score and without people just

473
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,150
gave up

474
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,210
yeah they start to try to make it better
in the meter kept telling him that they

475
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,940
were bad

476
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,000
and then there whatever I your meters
broken

477
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,950
I am great I'm a certain that's kind of
some highlights about past couple years

478
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,760
at work

479
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,390
I'm and just went a.m. really quickly 0
I give an overview of some of our

480
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,870
ongoing work

481
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,389
we have an process a project looking at
the start but he struck

482
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,480
at how people create passwords an EO
which characters adding when they're

483
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,730
deleting all this and a key timings and
things like that

484
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,700
we're doing a series of interviews about
pass for creation we're bringing people

485
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,690
into the lab

486
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,789
having them create passwords in front of
us and when they're doing the kinds of

487
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,620
things we say

488
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,649
I kept why did you put a one in an
exclamation point at the end then say

489
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,340
that that makes a secure password

490
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,270
well because people tell me that
passwords with Egyptian symbols are

491
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,730
secure passwords

492
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,970
okay and why are there so many monkeys
in your passwords yeah

493
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,100
things like that I will i doing and now
some mobile pastor creation that's ever

494
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,750
data collection I'm going

495
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,100
and we also are wrapping up a project
for looking at the sensitivity of the

496
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,459
guess

497
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,640
guess ability to the cracking outer them
a tool used

498
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,630
I'm so you know here shutouts in
particular to the dev server John the

499
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,159
Ripper

500
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,490
I ask at folks with your logic on offer
in providing tools are helping us

501
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,429
directly I'm

502
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,539
and now that particular project at so I
B after the whole group

503
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,669
thanks very much and we can take a
couple questions like 20 questions now

504
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:07,549
before lunch

505
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,840
and shine tired but happy to continue
taking questions throughout yet today

506
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,750
and tomorrow

507
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:18,750
thanks %ah

508
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,320
and a question home yes

509
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,289
your like actually

510
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,720
for your a jerk studies did you
restricts to us-cert use Google

511
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,789
I'm said depending on the study we are
doing and some we restricted to the US

512
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,649
to US only and some we did

513
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:41,340
global and examine differences since the
press population centers primarily US

514
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,949
and India

515
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,419
so does where we had people from both US
and India which actual compare the two

516
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:49,669
and everything for you %uh studies we
did that relied on your

517
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,429
English language knowledge or things
like that we were shifted to the US only

518
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:56,240
and can you come real differences
between those two sets for you to see

519
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,299
everything we did find some differences
between them and I mean some some of

520
00:27:59,299 --> 00:27:59,720
them

521
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,360
%uh there are some objective differences
and also some

522
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,620
where the security results would look
different because we're training mostly

523
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,908
I English language training data and try
to crack passwords Sep

524
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:14,000
would get any passwords yes sometimes I
like the pop duo of lying about it

525
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm might get that

526
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,940
and so the plots and at 10 to 13 guess
in some

527
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,750
do we know how many guesses attackers
make a yes

528
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,850
I'm so yes I said um we in fact I

529
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,010
yeah send your thoughts about this yes
oh yes we simulated the the PCG approach

530
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,190
and if you're using something like our
class cat Intl I'm not gonna stop after

531
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,669
10 to 13 guess is you're you're gonna
keep on going

532
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:46,940
you hit that in a matter of hours 'em by
the this is kind of assuming you're

533
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,070
looking at passwords

534
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,720
other hasher's with a slower algorithm
vanity I'm

535
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,510
on and you can just you know run a mask
attack

536
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,020
and and call it a day and and blow
through a lot of input you can make a

537
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,830
lot of guess is really really fast

538
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,230
as for why we stopped attended the 13
I'll wit

539
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,279
since user lookup table 2 to calculate
these just numbers rather than actually

540
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,620
out putting all of them

541
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,129
we ran our size on are just a sweet a
lookup table that big

542
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,409
around eight terabytes in similar more
recent work we're going at it and 14th

543
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:19,320
in the fifteen

544
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,309
but you know it's italiano it bear as
yet we all know it's it's an arms race

545
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:31,309
based on your hardware and attackers an
object that them

546
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,590
you create and password once and a new
entrant

547
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,970
thousands of times am did you consider
how

548
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,080
the users found usability

549
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,350
own how you defend as professors

550
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,149
right now so that's that's definitely a
limitation a our methodology is we

551
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,959
decided to

552
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,990
choose you know can you enter at your
five minutes after you make it and a

553
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,309
couple days after you make it

554
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:58,389
um and you conceivably ricotta yep chose
a lot to different things and you looked

555
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,130
at I am

556
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,350
you have a situation over time to typing
a password that's not something we've

557
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:02,879
looked at

558
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,740
on any of our works of art but its it's
on our radar and yeah

559
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,890
we had to make some choices on am me
those terms

560
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:18,700
and that's about it thinks Coast on

561
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,190
others
