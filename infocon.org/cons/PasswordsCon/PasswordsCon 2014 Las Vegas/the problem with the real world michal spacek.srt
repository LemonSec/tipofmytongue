big hype

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,579
I everyone my name is Michael and I'm
actually not

14
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,210
a bus for professional I don't crack
passwords I don't know much about

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,199
buzzwords

16
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,149
on more that developer I try to
implement all the stuff that you look

17
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,309
other guys are

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,949
like throwing at us and I would like to
tell you a story about

19
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,789
a you know trying to implement all the
security stuff and trying to implement

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,860
or improve password security it one of
the biggest check

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,330
e-commerce sites I am so

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,350
it's a true story we have done that and
I'll tell you what went wrong and what

23
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,408
we have learned about users and about
their behaviors

24
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,689
so Tom yeah I love these are true
stories

25
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,479
they are not really in chronological
order so it could happen in a different

26
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,189
order back in time but that doesn't
matter

27
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,110
so now the name of the dog the problem
with the real world the sexual part of

28
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,950
in unofficial part of a trilogy you know
there but there have been talks

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,350
and again last year the problem with
boss arts

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,140
and another talk was a problem with user
so i thought id okay let's make it so I

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,479
G

32
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,570
and call it the problem with the real
world am

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,869
so I yeah I'll tell you what worked

34
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,640
and or what not it might sound a bit
like complaining towards users

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,509
but some I've tried to call it a reality
check %uh

36
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,590
so I would talk about Tom side which is
called slight amount

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,790
its arm deal of the day type of sites
like Groupon it's the biggest chick side

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,060
I love this type it's actually doing the
job done

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,360
the revenue is $15 million Dollaz

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,379
in last year so it's kinda on big for
Czech Republic to republicans a

41
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,679
I did Emily on on people living there so

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,720
this company is kinda big and this
company has 150 employees

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,109
I had some database

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,910
%uh is so /url around one point and Ben

45
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,090
user accounts in the database and the
companies like one million customers

46
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,800
probably somewhat the user sections on
to customers a more icons but

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,430
that doesn't matter I am on it's running
on PHP and MySQL

48
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,849
and a why to actually protect the user
data

49
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,619
of course just because of the possible
words but that there's another reason

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,860
it's that the the the user's

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,670
have a also starred credit cards you
could the cards picture are not start at

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,420
the side

53
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,750
they are started the payment gateway but

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,000
still if someone did would steal another
user's account

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,730
they just can buy stuff using his credit
card even if the car is not actually

56
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,819
started that side

57
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,619
it start in the payment gateway is an
answer used by DAPI

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,700
on the attacker can still buy stuff
using betrayed got and

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,839
I am p.m. this company is a market
leader and did a deal

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,790
business so the company-wide also to
lead by example in a different area

61
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,970
because you know it's a some %ah
positive hiring

62
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,260
things as well if the developer ceded to
the company's doing stuff

63
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,810
and right way they might try to join as
well so

64
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,170
nom yeah I joined this company last
september

65
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,530
and I actually already left but it's not
related to distort

66
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,650
on back to it later I so yeah

67
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,430
i'd a joint as a a as a developer not as
a security guy

68
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,019
but I saw that there was a lot of stuff
done in a sub-optimal way to put it this

69
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:08,360
way

70
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,510
and size started the fixing it but some

71
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,790
other guys in the team and a young

72
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,469
it was a lot of issues so I'll 10 the
first issues

73
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,070
was that you know boss words were stored
an in and not really nice way

74
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,880
it will start as a show on unsalted now
so

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,620
yeah mmm we had to things that I am

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,600
we didn't try to crack the passwords for
the users because he said a duck it's

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,180
not our job but somebody else job
probably better as a job and doing his

78
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,530
job

79
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,888
but um %um I got some studs

80
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,009
because it was quite easy to run some
database queries I was kinda interesting

81
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,240
I remember that um the total amount of
the use this is one point and montana

82
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,410
sold the percentage of these accounts
quite low

83
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,479
but we found out that some of the user
selection is something quite

84
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,440
easy boss words and I don't mean Bossert
like possible on a bus or two

85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,910
adds that be palatial asserting the boss
words as their first name

86
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,919
and kinda I call BS but and they were
sitting in more

87
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,549
using the lower cased version of the
first name and like

88
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,789
you know the Fullers know their first
name problem adult capital first letter

89
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,120
it was done like five times less than
the

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,789
I then the password using the Lower Keys
version

91
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,930
on similar thing was for the last name
Angeles

92
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,990
mmm less times soul just five hundred
people are setting the password using

93
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,940
the

94
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,820
their last name and I'm

95
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,139
they also sometimes used their birthday

96
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,759
as a password so mmm

97
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,900
the first the first for modest as the
International for Monday month the year

98
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,280
which is what the Houston Czech Republic
and our E

99
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,630
using the separated the dot as a
separate adult on and they

100
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,430
does Mon note year it's the local
version of

101
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,889
a as the localized version update for my
two Czech Republic

102
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,419
I it's interesting I just three people
use this as a boss words

103
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,469
so on that didn't matter much

104
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,830
we also found know that there was a lot
of people using on

105
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,180
part of their email us as a boss words
up

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,470
so this stuff would bartered or it is
just an example the email address

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,660
by what we found on this that 3,000 a
nap 800 people

108
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,370
used on the forest borrowed the username
of do you know this is the boss Lord

109
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,069
and just ten people use the for the main
Bob our condo

110
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,250
a lot of people actually used the team
you know though

111
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,960
domain name but odor you know that the
early

112
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,349
and yeah be didn't run much more

113
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,500
tests because thats what they didn't
want to do

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,849
just are kinda interesting numbers from
you at least

115
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,889
so I'll or read it how we

116
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,650
to the passwords and we rehearsed and
using big rip

117
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,340
I am so that they are stored in a better
way and they debase

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,508
I'll what we've done that reef actually
has the passwords one-time

119
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,509
so that the bus or than burden stored
using

120
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,580
could this be gripped a show on for
months and manufactured in verifying the

121
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,729
user passwords

122
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,258
we had to first I should use a show on
and then

123
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,460
are than our own very high it is a big
rip

124
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,318
but the this way it's not nice

125
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,069
but at least we didn't have like xiao
long passwords in the database

126
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,490
the it is a something about a I'm when
we verify the password

127
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,639
and we you realize that picture the
password is correct we

128
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,789
rehash that using just a big trip to put
into the database so that he actually

129
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:44,500
about trying to remove the show won
their

130
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,979
because that was saddam guy and I i in
the cold it was creating a bike

131
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,190
on on inish on now unwanted

132
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,229
got complications so

133
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,409
yeah and when we know the password abuse
and addiction verified we start just

134
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,759
be conversion and we you realize that

135
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,900
on they risk and the possibility of
database breach

136
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,120
I'll be learned it the hard way I don't
mean that our databases hike but

137
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,379
we saw a lot of examples around us that
on

138
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,690
the database are being hacked so we said
that

139
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,259
okay let's make it the slightly harder
for for the guys who actually cooking

140
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,620
the passwords

141
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,720
and I'm sorry for the guys who are
trying to do that so

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,650
we I included the ashes we didn't have
the passwords

143
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,880
be included the ashes the final Ashes so
dead if somebody actually games the

144
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,219
access to database are still database

145
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,330
they first need to find the private key
as well 2xa another prior to keep the

146
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,470
the encryption key though D crypt
delicious and dense today are facing the

147
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,180
issue so they need to correct that

148
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,339
and so we included the dishes using

149
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,370
using guys and %ah

150
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,750
yeah thats are what we have now in the
database

151
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,440
thing is that we had to support and I'm

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,250
huge amount of authentication schemes
because we had you know the rehashing

153
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,680
take some time and the

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,199
any interruption as well three haitian
got the database to take a week

155
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,420
and we of we have to support the side
running

156
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,790
soul I %um the course kinda complicated

157
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,730
because we need to disappear like for a
vindication scheme some of them

158
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,740
bankrupted

159
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,250
some other much as host but yeah

160
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,920
so this is now how do a bus was lookin
the database this is actually my pastor

161
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,589
from the live database

162
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,550
I its included you see that on in the
red colored sucky idea we support

163
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,390
multiple keys so that we can do

164
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,230
Heikki securitization we support to

165
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,260
yeah with the bookies and the new civ4
the

166
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,730
are for decipher and then dnt today to

167
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,970
so this section is sa my password

168
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,800
we support move the bookies also for the

169
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,510
yet the database is actually shared
between the production database

170
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,430
I'll protection service and a and a
disservice which is not nice but

171
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,519
and is how it works I'll and

172
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
what I want it is that our you know our
local development machines

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,980
do not contain the production keys to

174
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,600
%ah the protection encryption keys
because if somebody loses the laptop

175
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,510
very sexually de ke for to offer the
decryption

176
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,670
and it happened so we wanted to have

177
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,579
different key on da letto development
machines so we had to support a key

178
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,979
rotation sold every time every morning

179
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,730
the database gets reloaded from the
protection service to the deaf in my

180
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,570
mind

181
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,959
the now the accounts are actually

182
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,768
re encoded using def a hockey

183
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,620
so that we can actually I access them
and use them

184
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,440
soul %um arm

185
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,630
we also hashed not just the passwords

186
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,800
mucosal every token was in the database

187
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,839
I because you know if somebody actually
games the extra database

188
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,839
and they see included boss was a host
password

189
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,890
and the sea you know tokens in a plain
text I mean tokens for

190
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,949
botsford visiting or on up but I'm on
and logins they can just use the state I

191
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,930
need a password sexual organ they needed

192
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,589
tokens sold weeee has posited tokens

193
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:22,589
as well so that somebody gains the
excess turn they don't actually

194
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,620
have the tokens and

195
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,800
young Tom so

196
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,680
but we found no that on there are some
issues in the cold this is just an

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
example it's not

198
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,199
the real college vice president David to
slide last month slightly more

199
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
complicated

200
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
but YUM we had a in the coat

201
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,510
this something similar to this %ah

202
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,269
there was a guy trying to work around
his like of knowledge of the tool you

203
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:51,589
are using

204
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,350
and so we introduce the SQL injection
vulnerability in turn to coat

205
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,440
and so that's why we also tried to

206
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,170
you know do with a boss addition
connection right

207
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,149
I am %um are funny thing was that
actually

208
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,180
how I found on that this was in the cold
I was just looking at the code base

209
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,649
and I saw file it was kind of a strange
name I didn't see it before

210
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:18,889
so I just open it I was like oh my
fucking god

211
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,760
and yeah I had to switch to something
else I had to fix this a lot about it

212
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,800
because I just looked at the file and I
saw that ability I wasn't just

213
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,779
you know doing any testing or just an
assessment I just saw this

214
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,410
a so in this Asus kinda strange for me

215
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,760
similar situation was that how one day
we were looking at our service he had a

216
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,889
managed service

217
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,620
you're looking at the service and those
a backup directory silicone

218
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,370
what's that so we take that and we
sought to love to go by two

219
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,290
database backups from some other service
so somebody

220
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,389
the the admin of the lord of the
Manitoba it was

221
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:57,700
doing some backups any for good to
delete the backups from our server

222
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,980
this was actually pick up from some
other projects he was managing

223
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,769
so it was databases of other users so

224
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,250
I like own okay so probably should
protect our database and users as well

225
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,010
because

226
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,920
even if we don't have any vulnerability
in the cold our database might end up

227
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,760
somewhere else

228
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,740
because somebody actually might pick it
up some elsewhere

229
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,779
and you know they might forget about it

230
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,980
so yeah thats what happened we are kinda
surprised

231
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,920
just to find that there are some backups
in on ourselves

232
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,229
on so what we have done then

233
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,019
are to protect the user's bf are removed
the possibility

234
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,019
he didn't have didn't remove support
regions meeting which has the

235
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,709
possibility to said the passwords

236
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,699
and the user profiles because what
people are doing they were actually

237
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,939
calling in

238
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,670
and now asking the supported a I forgot
my password can you just said the

239
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,040
password for this account

240
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,620
to what other and up cause the
suppositions like

241
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,029
yeah of course Hugo 1,2,3,4,5

242
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:04,500
and um like old you can't really do that

243
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,079
now so we remove the option to actually
said the boss or than the user profile

244
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,260
for the customer region

245
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,410
they very much a bidirectional they
better hope it all

246
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,899
Bob the it's really hard to verify the
user

247
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,690
if the user calling in its really user
who wants to change the password for

248
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,079
a so he said yeah let's just not do it
at all

249
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,510
so are yen we change it to the way that
should the support agents for their

250
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,490
sending just the boss orders that links
if somebody called in hey I forgot my

251
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,620
password

252
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,389
do you need the agent was like okay here
we go I just I'll just send you a link

253
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:41,510
very conscious at your own boss art so

254
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,880
add that look nice right but Tom

255
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,910
the people just didn't understand why we
are doing this

256
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,939
and Dale are not receiving the links
I'll

257
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,389
so he said maybe the links are ending up
and Anna spam folders

258
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,839
and we bald the support agents to
actually tell users they pay

259
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,560
guys look into the and to spend for
their order promotions folder in Gmail

260
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,989
and there was fine until you realize
that

261
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,410
there is a can the big check our email
provider

262
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,180
who one day decided today will
outsourced air

263
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,699
AB and to spin systems to some other
company

264
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:24,319
and I this company they were running on
budget are

265
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,139
kinda low budget and their servers

266
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:34,509
where overloaded so it took like up to
30 our structured other our emails

267
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,029
and you know the residents are expiring
created

268
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,709
a expiring in 15 minutes I believe

269
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,790
so if the user received erin is in 30
hours

270
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,939
they just couldn't said the Bossert
they're kinda locked out because they

271
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,320
forgot the password

272
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,570
they were not able to set it using our
via the customers operations

273
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,970
and Dave are not receiving the links so
arm

274
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,829
even be headed a bite listed I mean we
had our centers like listed and that to

275
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,130
a third party about

276
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,500
and they just stood and lower load so

277
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,300
we had to put an the money or something
back

278
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,209
are %um we had to put his money or
something back

279
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,250
because otherwise just people are
stopping using our website and they are

280
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,370
just stopping giving us our money owed
them money

281
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,699
so young we had to put that back now it
is not nice but

282
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:31,180
are and had to be done at least we tried
to do that

283
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,138
that we are you know look everything
every single change

284
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,540
and the user's actually notified if

285
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,790
the password exchange so if they change
the password out the user is notified

286
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,560
so they know that the bus almost changed
and they can react if somebody else to

287
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,569
the password

288
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,769
they can at least react and they know
about it and we have we have everything

289
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:51,370
ok

290
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,800
we know who was da pool who did that
which Customer Support agent did that

291
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,089
and everything so young are

292
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,120
initially there was an issue that the

293
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,490
people are also blocking the San thereof
the emails

294
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,429
the reason was that now we are sending
out email us with the same sander

295
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,189
wheeler something out mass emails like
newsletters and other spam

296
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,329
wat the same sender as such a

297
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,629
as the boss or does it links so people
like

298
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,689
okay we don't know how to unsubscribe
from newsletter so we'll just blocked

299
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:25,280
the user

300
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,339
the sender and

301
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,909
they were de vere not three single a bus
or that the emails

302
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,330
because apostle present links because
they just book

303
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,030
do you the sender completely they said
okay we are assuming some

304
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,190
use address religious book the user's on
blood the sender

305
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,140
and tubular not receive an e-mail
newsletters but they also still pursuing

306
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,390
a our whereas at Lynx bus with the
settings

307
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,809
so we learned that 0 with a corporation
the time or the

308
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:59,289
check email providers they told us they
pay you know these guys actually have

309
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:00,330
blocked you

310
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,860
and the your emails are not not ending
up in a sample there's

311
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,439
so arm marking as spam wasn't real issue
for us

312
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,390
because so the agent could tell the user
is that AP

313
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,500
just look at your spam folders

314
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,669
and but real blacklisting was an issue
for us

315
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,100
%uh so we had to set uniques on their
part of Skye me know

316
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,649
we had the same San therefore you know
it was a no replies and therefore

317
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,559
everything

318
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,820
so we have to set the UNIX and therefore
boss orders at the mouse

319
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,960
and difference and the phone use others
an actual difference and therefore

320
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,000
different ask

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,160
saw yep mmm

322
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,980
we had to yeah I just skipped few slight
sorry for that

323
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,450
now we had to enable my %uh sitting for
to put a boss or than the user profiles

324
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,789
just because people are in keeping power

325
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:59,710
Vera not receiving calls or emails and
what we found out then

326
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,880
is that a third of the tokens

327
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,220
which we are coming back to us but
actually already expired

328
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,660
I am so we found out that yet the
initial time was so

329
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,120
15 min is the expiration time we made it
tool

330
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,000
30 minutes but piece didn't we didn't
see any change it was still the same

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
still a third of the tokens are coming
back expired

332
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,850
I am soul %um we found out at

333
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,480
actually people either said their boss
or immediately when they receive the

334
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,870
link

335
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,809
or when they request a link or actually
didn't do it at all or they do it

336
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:37,668
are as late as next day are so so
difference between fifteen minutes and

337
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:38,870
thirty minutes was

338
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,299
there was none for us what we did then

339
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,668
I would guess that you might know the
shah screenshot

340
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:49,120
I'll we also moved the whole side to
https

341
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,439
because you know if people can still
boss or they can still session ID's and

342
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,070
that'd

343
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,700
so we moved the side to the HTTPS

344
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,530
we also added the us to transport
security header

345
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:07,100
and is able to solo version 3 so we are
getting really nice corder

346
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,770
and young mmm one day

347
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,730
as a different story on any idea what's
this

348
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,720
it's a boss or Tina on um we found
though that this actually was a boss or

349
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,809
two of our CEO

350
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:26,970
it's not this it was similar I just a
slightly modified it to protect her

351
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,320
by anyway it was this really simple
password

352
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,639
and how we found out mum I was still
again I was looking I was good at

353
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,929
looking at things in finding issues

354
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,760
so I was just looking at the database
and I found the table

355
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,000
I with passwords in plain text

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,650
for some reason even if we had boss was
hosting a great values and a grip

357
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,720
I am there was a issue in the cold that
actually

358
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,309
I you know was looking at the get the
time POS data

359
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,399
so that you can actually take the users
but there was an issue in there was a

360
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,610
bug in the code and it was looking also
the passwords

361
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,020
so we had I use a boss or simply
infections database

362
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,639
by the funny thing was that actually not
all the user passwords

363
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
but only possible for employees

364
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,460
HR kinda highly valuable so we had to
reset be at the resort all the passwords

365
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,950
body employees because like oh my god
that's not a good idea because you know

366
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,590
the pickups and everything

367
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,809
so you said the passwords and we didn't
reset the tokens deep in a mine in Logan

368
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:28,549
tokens

369
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,639
about I'll I read get receiving emails

370
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,929
saying that you know i i kno to reset my
password but my old boss or still works

371
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,240
it still working I can I can login using
the old password

372
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,150
I was like 0 you can't really do that so
I asked the

373
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,179
the girl what was she doing and I
realized actually she's not typing in

374
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,200
the password

375
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,610
she's actually using it but a monologue
in talking to login and she couldn't

376
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,129
differentiate between the token

377
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,900
and the boss words so I was like okay
but the you know

378
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,049
boss or than that but I'm on a good
looking is different think but for use

379
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:04,600
as they just don't understand the
difference

380
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,860
of course not all of them but something
just didn't understand the difference

381
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,520
so our YUM that some

382
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,620
some of my stories just to recap
slightly and the problems with the real

383
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,649
world our date

384
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,080
a you depend on the external parties you
and if you don't think so

385
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,210
our you are sending out boss ordered the
mouse and everything and that's a

386
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,419
third-party think

387
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:30,760
and the problems are user stages on
understand some key concepts of the

388
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,830
publications like you know but I'm on
Logan versus

389
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,600
signing in using password: and our

390
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,629
probably the biggest problem other
companies itself

391
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,960
they just don't care much about a
security now you're the reason why I

392
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,210
love the company was that

393
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,179
they said yet you are doing a nice job
here and protect and stuff and birds and

394
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:50,220
other users

395
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,870
but still owe you want to do for use or
to dedicate only 15 percent of your time

396
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,969
to the security

397
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,049
it is not like not even one day in a
week

398
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,500
so I said out gay but Tom you guys got
the real

399
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,190
a lot of issues here and I want to fix
that they said Nam but you should do

400
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,480
something better

401
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,580
something different like to know
fine-tune our newsletter so noted thanks

402
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,020
I said

403
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,389
now and it's why left %ah yeah

404
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,630
and I but if that's everything from me

405
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:24,630
soap thank you and if you have questions
feel free to ask

406
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,809
all right let's give it up for Michael
here are we got a few minutes left a

407
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,049
does anybody have any questions or if
you have questions later you can just

408
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:38,168
you know in money or tweet me like to

409
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:41,380
one question him

410
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,730
especially your customer you talked
about your customer support people

411
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,350
on being able to reset passwords are not
urge us to send out links

412
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,469
arm do what

413
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,340
what kinda decision process do they have
i mean

414
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,379
so many seitz these days have the
so-called security questions which

415
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,600
just due to their nature and the fact
that you know people don't take them

416
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,678
precisely

417
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,419
arm I'm pretty sure they're being stored
in plain text someone

418
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,220
yeah thanks for the question I have a
really simple answered they don't have

419
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,820
any

420
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,080
a you know when I joined the Davino
processes there was a lot of issues like

421
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,379
people to call in and just reset the
password

422
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,150
up for anybody salwar at least try to do
something better it's not a perfect

423
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,750
solution

424
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,970
I know that but is yet this do something
so they don't have any procedure

425
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,909
they just %ah it's up to the Customer
Support agent to verify the user

426
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:40,929
but they have no like formal procedures
to verified we don't have any

427
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:44,850
Anne um was that the security questions
it on who's that

428
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,860
because I'm you know to say the two and

429
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,110
the typical customer I'll decide ace
probably not even able to understand did

430
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,129
concept behind the security questions so

431
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,140
we don't have that or decide as a No
that a

432
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,190
so mmm yeah on don't know if I answered
your question

433
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,260
I'll on accept and now I'm not sure at
all

434
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,289
Howell how your customer support people
make a decision to

435
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,029
reset somebody's password arm yet

436
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,320
if somebody goes in there just wasn't a
bottled they just to know the password

437
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,260
for the link

438
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,570
today email address okay we've gone back
to the password reset link because it

439
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,908
sounds like you had stopped doing that
because

440
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:30,549
people were getting them very delayed
I'll

441
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:35,289
I yeah I now understand the question I

442
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,320
we didn't stop doing that we just
stopped doing that only for some

443
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,480
particle domains

444
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,510
we know you have the black little the
domains that picture these guys are not

445
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,690
receiving our emails

446
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,809
so and for these domains there is a
there is a a

447
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:51,710
these domains are allowed to set the bus
on many other for the others they just

448
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,010
need to reset the link

449
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,820
and send reset link and they are
instructed to actually

450
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,260
you know up send the resort links every
time

451
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,500
except if somebody really did tells them
that day I do indeed

452
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,179
I didn't receding I know it's not a
perfect solution but

453
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,529
wat didn't come up in like manner Koepke
account recovery is never perfect

454
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,220
solution

455
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,809
