about

57
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,200
any other topics that I'm discussing
then I do I'm a journalist

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,339
and I A come to this world as an
observer and

59
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,599
someone who's learning and so I hope
you'll bear with me as I am

60
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,910
tell you about my journey and I think
the real um

61
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,819
really what I want to do is tell you who
I am why am I here and why

62
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,019
why did I start care about passwords and
I am and privacy and how do I

63
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,140
feel like they fit together and so I
will just start a little bit like Who I

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,599
am

65
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,780
so in addition to being a normal person
and

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,340
I am actually an not that I'm I grew up
in Silicon Valley in Palo Alto

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,350
and am I learned I never statue
typewriter I was an early

68
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,060
digital native as you would say I learnt
programming in fifth grade my parents

69
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,500
are both

70
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,569
computer programmers and so I really saw
myself

71
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,069
as somebody who was going to go into the
technology industry I worked in my

72
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,760
summers

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,450
at Hewlett Packard and I was planning to

74
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,500
go into what was then the PC industry

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,739
the booming PC industry am but I loved

76
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,130
um working on my college newspaper in
journalism so I ended up from

77
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,530
deciding to be a journalist and I

78
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,789
wrote about technology so I covered

79
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,030
the dot-com boom at the wasatch n on the
dot-com bust and

80
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,409
all that nom exciting technology news

81
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,010
and in 2009 I A published a book

82
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,419
called stealing my space which was

83
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,010
about you know that long for on social
network myspace

84
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,110
cause I was right that social networking
was gonna be big

85
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,169
I was wrong the head myspace was
anything anyone cared about

86
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:54,349
I had picked the wrong social network to
write my book about her shirt written

87
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,310
about Facebook

88
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,000
but I'm out along the way a writing that
book

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,690
I A realized that the technology
industry which I had long been part and

90
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,270
written about wasn't it

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,000
different businesses in the business
have really monetizing your data

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,289
it was no longer about selling hardware
or software

93
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,990
which both the which used to be sold in
stores I'm

94
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,240
so when I came back to the wall street
journal after reading that book

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,650
II not I'm gonna focus on on

96
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,429
this new business and what is this whole
business a buying and telling data about

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,800
me

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,110
am so I started this a serious they're
called what they know

99
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,640
and I was basically just want to know
what do all these companies know that me

100
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,460
and who are they

101
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,930
selling it to him a course now I joke
that

102
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,180
if I were to do this series again I
should call but don't they know beckoned

103
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,880
this go because we've learned that they
know everything but

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,409
at the time it seemed quite them
innovative to

105
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,800
find out what they know and so I started
with I'm very basic set a

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,270
about web tracking and how that adds
value around and cookies and

107
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,099
JavaScript and I am was focusing on the
company's am

108
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:08,270
then I was looking at apt send your data
without you knowing it and

109
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,890
we read about how cool was Sam blocking
Apple's privacy controls with suffer

110
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,320
then embedded in Dad's

111
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,840
am and then we after about a year so

112
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,070
love up doing this work I realize that
the government was heavily in this

113
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,880
business so we started writing about
government surveillance

114
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,099
automatic license plate readers which
many police have installed on all their

115
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:28,930
arm

116
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,270
cars and so they take a picture every
license plate as they

117
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,060
drive-by keeper and big data basis a
anytime they want to know where you were

118
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,849
in the past

119
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:41,180
they have a picture of your car am and
we looked at facial recognition

120
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,849
technology and how police where really
excited about using that

121
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:48,430
and we ended up going and then to these
damn

122
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,310
surveillance fares which I'm sure must
have you heard about where I'm

123
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,490
company's lineup and sell theirs hacking
tools to

124
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,080
big-government am and so

125
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
after what had started as a what they
know one year maybe one story

126
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,380
ended up being three years an
investigative journalism

127
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,820
and am and yet at the same time

128
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,050
I still felt that people

129
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,200
were not totally convinced

130
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,729
that this art is pricey intrusions
matter to them

131
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,659
I'm at it party people would say well
why should I care

132
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,909
what can I do about it seems hopeless

133
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:34,349
and so I decided that I would write a
book

134
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,789
about whether there was any help
essentially why should you care and what

135
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,240
he do about it was the

136
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,949
reason I went to write this book track
that nation and so I wanted to explore

137
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,830
philosophically is there a reason you
should care what kinda bad things get

138
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,120
actually happened to me

139
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,130
with my day they're being out there and

140
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,569
if I decide that those things are bad
enough they want it do something about

141
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,419
it

142
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,900
what should I do and so I set out on
this journey

143
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,739
and then dove 2012 and I am

144
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,050
you and tried to figure out when I can
protect my privacy

145
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,080
of course the funny thing and I haven't
actually thought passwords

146
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,870
at all actually am I had really crappy
passwords I had all the same password

147
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,479
site had sent I first

148
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,318
internet account and so but I was
getting ready and I was learning about

149
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,870
crypto tools and as excited

150
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,520
and I am before I can even start my
privacy journey

151
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,049
my Twitter account was hacked an
basically

152
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,780
my Twitter account password was a 6

153
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,318
at letter word from there dictionary

154
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,760
does not happen to be the same word that
I use for almost

155
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,439
every other account embarrassingly
missus after being a tech reporter and

156
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,069
surf ok you know thinking that I knew a
little bit about technology

157
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:55,910
on but I was hacked it was the Labor Day
weekend of 2012

158
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,860
and on you know they sent out a list

159
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,010
spam on my account I A

160
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,630
realized at that point that I couldn't
really focus on privacy without

161
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,160
addressing security

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,329
that they were the same thing I needed
to have secure password need to secure

163
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,589
my data

164
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,230
before I could worry about the
government or companies taking it for me

165
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,170
I had to at least put a lock on the door
so this is what started my journey I

166
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,400
have thinking about

167
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,079
passwords so I realized that I

168
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,290
um needed to know something about the
world the passer te started reading all

169
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,370
the literature

170
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,520
am I called several people in this rumor
experts for advice

171
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,040
and I was shocked to learn that every
single thing I've been told about

172
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,449
passwords what's wrong

173
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:44,199
right so changing them every three
months was bad idea

174
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:49,520
a having to assemble in SM so symbol
police you have my office

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,060
would insist was wrong that com I A

176
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,050
you note not writing them down was wrong
and so

177
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,380
I realize that in my own world that like
I had

178
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,810
my office required all other things and
so

179
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,719
my password basically had devolved to
every time they sent out the reset

180
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,250
it would be March 2011 question mark

181
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,670
so whenever they sent it was in the
password I and then the next

182
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,699
Reese that they would send it I would
say oh june 2011

183
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:23,390
exclamation point instead and these were
absurdly

184
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,600
hackable as you on them so

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,390
I looked it but i wasnt wanna easy to
figure out what was the solution

186
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,480
am people told me about schemes I could
use in my mind

187
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
you know the if I would think if you use
my spatial memory and remember

188
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,500
objects that I could come up with like
passwords that were really long and

189
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,430
memorable

190
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,300
but every time I thought about doing one
of the things I felt exhausted

191
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,709
and when I realized with my mind was the
greatest obstacle

192
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,020
this heading passwords because I don't
know any room in my mind

193
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,439
for additional creativity related to
pass for generations

194
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,970
so I decided to move to automation

195
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,640
so I ended up um with I use 1password

196
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,819
am and and then but then I that wasn't
enough like so one password is something

197
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,520
that I use for

198
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,209
most my counts but and your password for
one pass for any a pastor from a

199
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,089
computer I need a password for

200
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,030
I'm my bank account in various things so
I also

201
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,220
am started using nice where which I'm

202
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,010
how many people in the room a perfect
for everybody okay not as many people

203
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,140
they would have thought so dice where

204
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,670
is a method love coming up

205
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,930
with long password it a dictionary

206
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,900
and all the words in it are numbered and
basically you roll the dice

207
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,420
in order to pick the words outta the
dictionary

208
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,150
and string those words together as a
password

209
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,860
and the reason year old I a sister to
the course at post an essay and even pre

210
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,010
an essay in those on a good idea it's
just random number generators on the

211
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,959
Internet

212
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,160
so you can ensure that randomness

213
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,689
by rolling dice and

214
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,490
so I had this great method everyone says
it's very

215
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,890
hard to break and its easy to remember
because you have five dictionary words

216
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,959
in a row

217
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:18,910
but once again I was lazy and so I paid
my daughter to do it

218
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,980
got to roll the dice for me so she come

219
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,250
she %uh charged me a dollar password and

220
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,450
am she says her rates are going up
though

221
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,140
happen but she she would roll the dice
for me and gives

222
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,189
give me I'm always nice password and
actually she started a business

223
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,730
om so I started using her passwords and
then a bunch of my

224
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,010
a relatives really oh I would like some
password so

225
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,050
now my daughter has nine has a.m.

226
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,930
the password business on the side and of
course the hilarious thing about it is

227
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,989
it's very hard to explain to people

228
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,140
why it's perfectly OK to bypass or

229
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,310
because they think you have to be super
secret and

230
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,989
com and that have to think about
themselves but in fact

231
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,329
as long as you add some sort of symbol
somewhere in the middle of those five

232
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,050
words

233
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,660
or whenever you want to add or am
capitalization

234
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,000
at my daughter's never going to be able
to figure it out and by the way she also

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,970
doesn't care

236
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,550
fresh cheese nut she's not trying to
hack into your cats

237
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,729
so I'm so I still feel like this might
be there

238
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,000
the plant again college tuition paid for
its my daughter's

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,250
password business am but still I have to
say even after all those effort to

240
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,970
and them out effort to which I went is
basically

241
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,310
100 times more than any normal person
would do and even then

242
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,300
am I would say I have a pretty failed
password approach which is

243
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,910
I have three different computers each
one of them has a one Password

244
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,730
file on it and I don't sink them because
I don't believe in the cloud and trusted

245
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,459
insight

246
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,660
you know have to put in Dropbox and so I
curious I'll stick

247
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,060
can I transfer Mike you know if
passwords around and it's a complete mmm

248
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,880
pain in the ass and the man has been
really annoyed because I never have my

249
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,500
passwords with us whenever

250
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,740
he wants CNN my Amazon account and i can
remember I don't know what my password

251
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,200
is kind of course I didn't make it was
generated either by dice where or by

252
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,910
this

253
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,050
one Password Generator a and

254
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,479
so you know and also want hazardous
analysis of my passers in turns out that

255
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,910
they're still kinda crappy because
there's leftover ones I haven't upgraded

256
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,850
and so you know it's really sad
situation to be in which is there like I

257
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,769
have tried really hard probably harder
than anyone else

258
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,600
and I I still have kinda probably a
B-minus

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,310
on on passwords and I have said that go
out and talk

260
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,880
about my book the one thing that gets a
gasp from the audience

261
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,720
every single time is when they asked me
how I passwords are nice a 40 characters

262
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,990
and the entire audience cast it

263
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,040
as as a possible I can't do it

264
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,469
it's too hard I

265
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,209
I am so I anyways

266
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,199
so that was the beginning at my privacy
journey on passwords and then i'mma tell

267
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,130
you a little bit

268
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,620
about all the rest have the journey
which didn't have to do with passwords

269
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,320
but

270
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,800
um i think is interesting so upgraded I
began

271
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,939
um trying to protect my privacy by the
way

272
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,279
the Edward snowed in revelations came
out and

273
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,550
you know one thing about this known in
revelations is that they basically

274
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,859
made me feel for the first time in my
life that I had been

275
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,110
under paranoid rate so I actually did
not think that the government was

276
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,630
collecting every single

277
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,740
record every phone call made and and so

278
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,089
it made me approach my journey with

279
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,790
a new sense have commitment which is
that oftentimes at conferences like this

280
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,569
people talk about very

281
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,680
these attacks which she just can't tell
if their theoretical

282
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,609
or not rate it's hard for somebody like
me need to assess

283
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,279
whether these things that you guys talk
about as oh it could be cracked in five

284
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,449
minutes actually

285
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,930
going to be cracked five minutes and the
one thing we learned from

286
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,339
all the revelations for the past year is
that everyone in the Sierra Club tax

287
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,430
appears to be being deployed great I'm
and so there is no such thing as a

288
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,630
theoretical attacked they are all being
used by somebody

289
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,350
and so then that makes the privacy
journey that much more

290
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,579
important to try to accomplish and

291
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:36,180
so at the same time I'm a mother of two
kids I'm normal

292
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,000
has percent has a and so I really didn't
want to

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,230
abandon computing or my cell phone or
any of these thing so

294
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,940
I A want all the fruits have the
technological world

295
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,899
so I basically tried to do my journey is

296
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,470
what is the best you can do to protect
your privacy with out giving up

297
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,070
you know connection to the modern world
so the first thing I did was quickly

298
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,910
using Google search

299
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,980
so Google I am has great search engine
as you are now but

300
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,750
the store you know every search that you
make

301
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,069
and and turns out that when you look at
the history a

302
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,589
your searches as I did when I looked at
mine it is an incredibly revealing

303
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,879
am map up your mind straight so my

304
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,889
searches which I looked at one when I
looked at mine they were stored

305
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:27,359
dating back to 2006 but I had turned off
the lake

306
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,290
don't store them for ever and oh by the
way even if you turn that off they just

307
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,110
store them

308
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,139
under your IP address and save your name
which is a distinction with little

309
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:35,760
difference

310
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,158
as you may now and so

311
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,310
minority matched your midsection it was
like every morning you know it's like

312
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,690
I'm cool the weather and then I would be
the leading for breakfast and then I

313
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,350
would cool you know where I was going
for my meeting

314
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,600
and what story does working on and so
and there are 3 p.m.

315
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,030
I would invariably should have some
certain Google meltdown rose going like

316
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,300
shoes I want to buy

317
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,960
or something you know and so it realized
that this was a great intimate

318
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,429
with more intimate than a diary read it
was actually should have where my mind

319
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:05,250
was going

320
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,210
all day and the idea that Google storing
it for ever

321
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,830
and they wouldn't let me have it rights
I tried to download it but I couldn't

322
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,260
get

323
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,780
they keep it and they can analyze it you
know so they can you overtimes with the

324
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,360
quantified self know how to learn from
data about yourselves but this is Dana

325
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,658
that they're learning about me and I'm
not learning about myself

326
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:28,520
and so this asymmetry means that
basically they can figure out at 3 p.m.

327
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,850
my mind goes a little crazy and exploit
that

328
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,379
in some way and I didn't want that so I
switched to Duck Duck Go

329
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,860
which is a search engine that doesn't
store any data

330
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,800
and its kinda pain because it doesn't
know anything about me so when i search

331
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,980
for

332
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,820
and kedo Natural History Museum and I
live in New York

333
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,389
give me the one in London but what I
realized is that

334
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:55,928
actually such a high price to pay for
privacy to just write new york

335
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:59,540
at then you know we've all gotten so
lazy want Google to like finish the

336
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,780
sentence porous

337
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,178
but then I would you like to pay this
price architect New York

338
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,280
I think it will kill me so I still use
duct echo

339
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,270
and I find everything that I need
something to work a little harder

340
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,750
and sometimes my colleagues make fun to
me takes me a little longer

341
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,850
but I also feel good that I'm not

342
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,120
contributing to this database a every
single thing that ever thought about

343
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,820
that will be used against me in some way
which I can't yet in vision

344
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,879
a so then after that I focused on the
social network so

345
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,540
I basically fell that in today's world I
couldn't actually quit Facebook

346
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,260
it was sorta like I wouldn't it was
almost like I felt like you'd vanish

347
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,899
from the earth

348
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,810
you can have an actual page so I just um
I didn't want to be on Facebook because

349
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,889
I feel that

350
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:47,408
exposing your social network everyone at
your friends with and that list is

351
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:48,490
basically

352
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,030
very it's impossible to make that list
entirely private so

353
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,620
that is be incredible amount of data
about you what we all think we're pretty

354
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,330
unique but in fact

355
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,639
are friends they often like the same
movies and theme music and they live in

356
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:03,600
the same town and they

357
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,199
they were our connections reveal a lot
about us and so I

358
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,560
basically decided that the best strategy
was to unfriend everybody on Facebook

359
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,879
and so I went through and unfriended
everyone which was some

360
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,050
completely painful in fact and a higher
some

361
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,470
p228 because they're he allowed see
their phase them if it makes it very

362
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,369
hard to come look at their face and then
you feel that your sadness

363
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:30,658
am so I ended up paying somebody to
click the

364
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,320
unfriend buttoned more than six hundred
times and now I just have a page

365
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,310
that says I'm not here I'm on twitter am

366
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,320
I was able to quit LinkedIn actually
because I felt like

367
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,530
actually that wasn't as important so I
left it all together I deleted my

368
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,599
LinkedIn up my brother told me that
you're never gonna get a job again bed

369
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,090
affair and we'll see fingers crossed
rape am

370
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,899
so after that I ain't decided to attack
my web browsing so I wanted to be as

371
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,369
safe as possible so

372
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:07,320
I A installed I'm HTTPS everywhere which
is sad basically encrypts your

373
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,408
connection to the web so that you

374
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,190
any particular at a place like this
where everyone is sniffing the wifi all

375
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,980
the time it's a

376
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,379
very good idea am other acceptor Nepal
wave height

377
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:20,830
in the spring has a preventive measure
am

378
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,609
and and then I installed some ad
blocking technology

379
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:27,658
am disconnector ghost rare both are good

380
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:31,820
I tried but them and then I just made a
vow to the cloud

381
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,149
so I cook took it out of the dual cloud
and put it into

382
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:39,649
SpiderOak which is an encrypted cloud
service so that everything is in cryptid

383
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:40,300
am

384
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,450
even before it leaves my machine and am

385
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,560
had to pay for that service at least two
hundred dollars a year so that is some

386
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,230
pricing and 1password also those pricey
am so

387
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,940
AI started to the bill started to mount
as I continued

388
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,129
this journey am I didn't have as much
luck

389
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:02,219
actually with all the encryption a you
know there's all this great

390
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,570
encryption programs out there but I
couldn't get anyone to use them

391
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,629
so my husband refused to do in Captain
email with me so that's a complete pain

392
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,800
why would I do that

393
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,869
I'm my kids actually sort of elected
sound seems like secret codes you know

394
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,590
so the kids kids like secret code so we

395
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,689
I convince them to use on silent taxed

396
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,750
and silent phone with me which are the
syncopated

397
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,230
perhaps that they could put on the iPad
am

398
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,450
and then and then I had to tackle
commerce which is actually really hard

399
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,980
so

400
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,919
doing commerce in any certain anonymous
Rd identified way is pretty difficult

401
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,310
but I realized that

402
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,490
in today's world what you guys almost as
revealing your pally more revealing than

403
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,540
your Google searches and so I wanted the
opportunity to

404
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,470
bring some love that outta this massive
database that will be mined by someone

405
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,510
whether to Amazon or the government

406
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,990
so I actually realize that the best way
for me to do that was to set up at

407
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,169
fake identity I would just like to point
out this was legal

408
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:07,899
so I am I got an american express card

409
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:11,928
in another name and it's just attach to
my account

410
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:16,270
so that it as if I'm responsible for all
the charges but the

411
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,310
card said Ida Tarbell nighter bell as a
journalist heroin at mine she was a

412
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,609
muckraking journalist

413
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:27,320
from the turn of the century who really
exposed all the %uh monopolistic

414
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,109
behaviour of Standard Oil which then led
to its break-up

415
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,859
and so I felt that I to wouldn't mind
being used

416
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:38,119
who in this way and in fact her
biographer actually wrote to me later

417
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,730
and said that it would have been proud
to be used as

418
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,970
at my alternate identity which was I
thought very nice

419
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,099
so I have a um American Express card
with I to travails name on it and then I

420
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,678
got her an Amazon account

421
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,109
and somebody me a friend let me use her
address and so now

422
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:57,550
I that can order all my books about
history the stassi in the history than a

423
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,840
sec a.m. the history

424
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,820
you know all of the books that I feel
like I'ma and Mia land me on the list

425
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,899
and now go tonight as account although I
would just like to point out I'm proudly

426
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:11,719
on the list anyways and this so at any
rate

427
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,960
am so those where some my very
successful strategies

428
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,159
have am mean moderately successful
strategies

429
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,409
have time to airlift myself out of the
dragnet none of them would be effective

430
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,590
if the government was actually after me
in some way

431
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,609
so and that's not my goal my goal is not
to be

432
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:33,710
um on fine double as a criminal my goal
is just that I don't feel that there's

433
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,169
any

434
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:38,030
resented that they should be collecting
data on me until they have to

435
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,780
one side become a suspect then they
should do whatever and they should not

436
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,300
american express is they who really is
ida and I'm

437
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,810
am actual hand me over in a hot second
I'm sure

438
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,040
but I just didn't feel like um being
surveilled

439
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,658
at every single time that I went to a
restaurant and then you know I know if

440
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:56,909
you've ever had this experience but

441
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,700
you to russia ending in email the next
day like thanks for coming I never gave

442
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,310
you my email address rate so

443
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,629
there's just too many of those weird
moments where

444
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:10,760
their collecting data and using in ways
that you don't think are going to happen

445
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,990
on in the end though there were two
areas rose totally unsuccessful so

446
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,440
one was on this phone so these things
are super convenient I love my phone

447
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,550
and I have it with me all the time but
it is basically

448
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,500
impossible to fake to prevent
surveillance to the phone

449
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,030
and the reason is because I can't
install privacy suffer on it that

450
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,760
monitors all the connections

451
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,419
that's making said the black box and so
we know there was a recent revelation

452
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:38,109
about some

453
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:42,129
hit in features and Apple that were true
it could transmit data without your

454
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:42,780
knowledge

455
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,030
and there are many feet things in here
that transmit data without your

456
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,300
knowledge gaps can be sending
information

457
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,178
you know the cell phone companies both
Verizon and AT&T have businesses

458
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,500
where they sell their customer's
location information aggregated form

459
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,540
I'm so there's there's really not any
controls I could put on it

460
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,889
I experimented with a few things I could
to encrypt adapts

461
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:08,250
but those are only for other people who
use um the same encrypt it up

462
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,109
so there was no blanket privatise Africa
put on the whole thing

463
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:16,418
so I ended up having to am the first
aimed at getting either A Phone second

464
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:18,310
have at least another name

465
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:23,099
um but it you know it turns out that I
deny very similar lives you know we got

466
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,000
the same places in me

467
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,030
stay at the same home and so a I
realized very quickly that it was going

468
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,790
to be pretty easy to link

469
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,030
the tail and so then ended up with a
very sad solution and just sticking in

470
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,800
there

471
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,030
and a back to ferret cage when I didn't
wanna be tracked

472
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,790
and and that's basically im bad lined
with

473
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,750
metal that prevent any transmissions and
and

474
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,990
and I really did that only to
demonstrate the fact that this is a

475
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,869
device that we have moved our computing
from a

476
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:56,570
p at computer that actually can be
fairly modified to something that's very

477
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,240
on modifiable and that prevent that
limits our ability

478
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,500
to prevent surveillance and the other
thing that I failed that was getting my

479
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,669
name out all that data brokers that are
out there so

480
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:12,230
I put together a list have 212 data
brokers and this is just

481
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,510
want I could figure out existed major
people who make

482
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,649
basically buy and sell mailing lists
have your name address yearly your likes

483
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:23,239
and dislikes basically they buy data
from each other so one of them has your

484
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,500
you know who's a hunter who is a hunting
license another one has magazine

485
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,490
subscriptions in a trade in

486
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,580
build up the robust profiles a view that
they sell to anyone

487
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,790
they sell them to law enforcement they
sell them to big companies they sell

488
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,408
them

489
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:39,450
I'm to individual to you know if you've
ever search for your name

490
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,810
online you'll see that by your data and
by information about so-and-so for 95

491
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,270
cents

492
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,200
I am so all those guys they have no

493
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,210
there's no law requiring them to let
your move your data so

494
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,190
up the 212 that I identified only 92 you
offered opt-outs

495
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,450
and so I opted out of the ones I could
but that means action the bad actors

496
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,460
now have my data so in some ways
actually in world you know I

497
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,540
forwarded the bad actors as they have
now data that's more scarce

498
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,589
to more valuable and also I wanted to
see my data it will I was desperate to

499
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:13,839
see what they had on me

500
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,849
but I was only able to receive my files
from thirteen up

501
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:22,010
and so this again is a cat just a
failure of transparency across the board

502
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,408
this

503
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:27,649
industry is not accountable to anyone
and the data is used in many many ways

504
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,729
am the report I read did receive form
wildly

505
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,839
varying in quality so some of them were
incredibly accurate and some were wildly

506
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,060
inaccurate

507
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,740
and it just occurred to me that if
nothing else

508
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,669
I'm a lack of transparency is a shield
for incompetent straight said they can't

509
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,070
sell this data

510
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,859
and nobody knows that it's totally
crappy if at least if we had all

511
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:55,050
access to it weaker damn weekend reward
the people who have

512
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,480
better data quality so in the end of my
journey

513
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,470
II counted up what I had spent

514
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,080
and actually it spent to new house in
five hundred hollers

515
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,320
in one year trying to protect my top
privacy which

516
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,810
is too much and so I came away with this
feeling that you know I really think

517
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,330
if nothing else wanted to rate you
should be having is is this really

518
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,199
something we want to be a luxury

519
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,609
that only the rich can afford or is this
something that we need to

520
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:27,480
try to build and some protections for
everyone

521
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,220
and I think a bit as auto safety hear
cars are dangerous but getting them

522
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,760
every single day

523
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,080
and one reason is because they have safe
based find safety standards rate they

524
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,839
have to meet certain minimum and then
you can buy your way up the chain you

525
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,690
can get the Volvo if you really want the
full safety

526
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,080
but at least we all know that they have
to meet this minimum and if they don't

527
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,379
we can see them are they gonna have to
go test by in congress and pay out

528
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:54,270
millions to

529
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,649
victims and say they're really sorry and
that's just not true and

530
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,729
the Dana world I am you know you joined
Facebook under one set up

531
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,389
privacy policy and then they change it
three months later and there's nothing

532
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,550
you can do

533
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,530
and so you there's no baseline make a
change it tomorrow that says like your

534
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,300
son a later date in north korea

535
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,760
and I bet just okay he's old when you do

536
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,280
so we don't have any baseline in this
world and so then it makes it harder

537
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,129
also for people to sell

538
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:26,439
services up above it because everyone is
treated as a suspect

539
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,050
and there's no way to prove that
companies are trustworthy in this

540
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,089
business

541
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:34,190
and so with that I guess am unaware time
is but I'd like to

542
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,550
open it for questions I me happy to you
talk tomorrow have a lot of time I talk

543
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,369
really fast

544
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:43,359
to an anyone yes

545
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,089
well I think I have Michael can handle
okay

546
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:53,389
ok ahead

547
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:57,089
on huh

548
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:01,149
I

549
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:04,979
are why spent time

550
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,280
time I mean I spent 12-18 months

551
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,889
yeah I mean tyson 2500 money and the
knife but I spent like a

552
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,389
I mean it's been a year doing this
project now I was writing the book some

553
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:17,800
portion of that but I mean I

554
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,820
committed legal a you know babyy six
months of

555
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,379
my man-hours to it so that's a lot

556
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:33,139
did american express require I did to
have a social security number

557
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:37,689
because you can get a card now unless
you provide that I know they did and

558
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,010
they asked me if I have a social
security number and I said no

559
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,290
and they said okay both on the card out
and the funny thing is that

560
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,099
american express I asked them later
about their policies

561
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:54,149
and I have never been able to get a
straight answer from them

562
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:58,418
I think that they essentially basically
do offer this service because

563
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:02,230
parents get says cards for the kids are
they want to be responsible for their

564
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,500
nannies charges or whatever there must
be

565
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,490
that seems as though this is something
they offer as long as you're willing to

566
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,300
take responsibility for the other named
account

567
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,220
they apparently don't seem to have as
but they'd also don't want to advertise

568
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,099
its ok

569
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,220
58 sorta it's a murky

570
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,300
situation american express asked me to
speak I went spoke in front like 150 top

571
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,109
american express executives

572
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,830
and I asked them about this policy and
they didn't answer

573
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,869
I

574
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:35,699
3 a.m. know they did not throw a net
over me in turning to the Fed's what I

575
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,089
also thought might happen

576
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:40,810
yet I waste I'm

577
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:44,849
the got visa and then eventually
MasterCard's for his parents the Czech

578
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:45,480
Republic

579
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,109
no social security numbers yeah I know
I'm you can do this with other cards to

580
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:50,530
I'm sorta unfairly

581
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,158
singling out american express but I
actually learned this technique by the

582
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,080
way from a

583
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,970
well-known kept AGA for John Kalisz who
said to me

584
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,440
because I said I'm having a struggling
with this issue or how to come up

585
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,520
how did you commerce without always
giving my identity and

586
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,700
out any whipped heard them some cards
with other names but

587
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,849
I was like I had to do that but and

588
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,089
he told me and that I got this idea so

589
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:20,970
arm I'll talk to you later about sinking
your one pass for data but

590
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,659
without going to drop box but I am up

591
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:30,270
you you know in your book

592
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,280
20 K was beside are

593
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,750
the president the ACLU talking about
stuff like this

594
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,599
recently said something like the last I
heard

595
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,020
Facebook and Google can't throw you in
jail

596
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,770
or arm or put you on the no fly list so
she makes a distinction

597
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,639
between governmental surveillance and

598
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:57,020
non-governmental surveillance Wow

599
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,429
in your book you kind of take a
different approach and I'm

600
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:03,669
and I kinda liked it yet you're why

601
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,869
yeah absolutely so I started this
journey actually focusing on corporate

602
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:11,190
surveillance as I came to it I think in
a way there's actually very different

603
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,629
most

604
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:15,040
privacy and could start with the
government and understandably because

605
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,599
the government as you said can throw you
in jail

606
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,070
but one I i think there's a couple
reasons that I think it's important to

607
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,810
focus on

608
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,839
both one is that the two are so
incredibly intertwined

609
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:30,409
what do we see from the senate
revelations we saw the government going

610
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,710
to these companies

611
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,550
and saying give me this data I have a
secret court order

612
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,859
and then we also say by the way them
going and breaking into the data center

613
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:40,399
so like

614
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,649
they get to the front door are they
going to the back door so

615
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,679
part iv: this issue is that once

616
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,980
it in the hands a corporation the
government's going to do

617
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,500
what it can to get that data but
secondarily there's also

618
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,119
real harm the comes just from the
corporations themselves

619
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,910
so some of the things that am my
investigative team at the wall street

620
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,240
journal wrote about was how

621
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,479
data how these companies use your data
against you sound tell you a few

622
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,190
examples

623
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,290
so um we write about Capital One so
Capital One has 0

624
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,690
thing on their website when you comin
the immediately

625
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,839
check your computer your cookies your IP
address whatever data they can get

626
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,089
from the automat you know that
automatically transmitted and make an

627
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:25,680
instant assessment your income and your
ability to pay

628
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,710
and then they show you the card that
they think is best for you

629
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,500
so we analyzed computer traffic that
went back and forth and it literally

630
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,740
said in there

631
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,319
HTTP traffic it said low-income you know
low education and that's how they had

632
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,960
designated these people and then they
would show them kinda

633
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,910
were scarred than the people who they
designated as high income

634
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,759
so this is basically steering now you
could still apply for any card you want

635
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,349
but you are

636
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:55,500
steered towards one card am we also burn
about staples which is staples has

637
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,560
actually taken a step further to
everybody

638
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,339
I am who goes to staples in this is true
to this day I believe and gets a

639
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:03,140
different price

640
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,290
on office supplies based on Darren
assessment aware hewlett

641
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,000
so they look at your IP address and make
an assessment and where

642
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,230
which zipcode urine and then certain two
coats get higher prices in certain lower

643
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,000
based on whether they're close to a
competitor's store

644
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,190
so it make sense from an economic
perspective because

645
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,630
I'm if you live near an Office Max or
office Depot theoretically you're

646
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,630
comparing prices and you might

647
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,550
choose to go to the stores but also just
happens that people who live near this

648
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,460
competitors stores are wider and hurt
more high-income

649
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,609
so essentially people are getting low
the worst prices have been higher prices

650
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:43,670
are minorities and low-income people and
so we have the scope

651
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,369
love redlining can change right we never
had the ability to on me.

652
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:52,329
redlining on a massive scale and we're
just starting

653
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:56,000
to see how the state will be used by
corporations and I'm

654
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,380
just as worried about that as I am

655
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,160
about the government because some of
these companies are bigger

656
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,399
then governments right Google for
instance when the European Union told

657
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,079
them

658
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,700
but there'd privacy policy change
violated the European data protection

659
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,250
laws

660
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,910
google said so what right didn't even
have to comply

661
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,920
now if you're on the ground and your
Boeing you're making

662
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,700
cleans in europe you actually to comply
with the laws Becker but

663
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,450
always comes transcend the bill is for
enforcement

664
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,859
and so they're bigger and government in
some ways and so we

665
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,650
I think need to pay attention to both
sides have it and then I will give

666
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,790
one last thing which is that they feed
on each other so one thing

667
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,800
that people don't realize is how much
the data fees on each other so when you

668
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,000
register to vote

669
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,080
you go to your 10 government and they
require information from you

670
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,310
and then many of those government state
government actually sell those data

671
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,250
to data brokers and then those data
brokers sell a back to the government

672
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,450
enter in these built up reports so

673
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,470
they all feed on each other for all urs
tinner

674
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,589
11 there's one here II two questions
actually

675
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,640
other persons in relation to data broker

676
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,850
opt out survey rhyme attempted opt-outs
I'd

677
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,500
no wonder if you ever tried safe
sheppard as a service to

678
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,370
do that remove tracking in Aruba for you
I had to actually did not use a shepherd

679
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,690
but I actually used to

680
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,320
different companies that promised to do

681
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,170
um to remove your data from data brokers
if you name them into I'm happy to name

682
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,760
them there

683
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,470
in my book one is called delete me from
a rhyme and one

684
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,560
was called I'm mail stop shield from
catalog Choice

685
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,240
and they both failed

686
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,799
um they no one would know they had
failed

687
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,080
other so they said they knocked me out
all these places

688
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,900
but because I'm an investigative
journalist I called all those places and

689
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,330
said whether really up to that

690
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,880
and it turned out that in both cases 50
percent

691
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,990
them they had not turning out and so I
actually had to go to them and say

692
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,120
am any refund and one of them shut down
their business

693
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm messed up shield at I think its

694
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,380
not I need to be heard business to be in
because the data brokers

695
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,200
can make any excuse for not processing
up to so

696
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,370
I'm not sure I would blame the companies
themselves

697
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,750
they probably did send it although the
date worker said it didn't get it wasn't

698
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,180
some trade or whatever

699
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,779
but in the end um the state workers are
so

700
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,570
incentivized to do anything to make it
not go through

701
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,270
but I learn to be skeptical that
separates

702
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,970
follow-up is in relation to your you
really assure I did yes

703
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,600
is a is Jennifer Valentino another one

704
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,060
no determine how do you as my colleague
at the wall street journal I did you

705
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:56,060
look up to you

706
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,140
oh my god owed Jennifer cella by
WordPress account

707
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,460
me in the all day is huh that's very
funny I'm

708
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,780
no actual change that thank you for
letting me I

709
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,830
it easily found years

710
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:17,830
is it

711
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,170
rate okasha feel bad for 10 afraid out
I've

712
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,530
cliff may expose her privacy discuss you
help me okay

713
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,410
yes I found your comment being about
going to the government and registering

714
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,129
to vote

715
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,000
and having an information go into these
other systems very interesting

716
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,250
and there was a report by WNYC a couple
months back where

717
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,970
anybody going to New York housing court
whether they won lost whether they were

718
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,270
brought there

719
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,740
you know for your their own grievances
are by the landlord

720
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,629
matter who showed up on his docket
numbers: people were paid by national

721
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,460
firms to set the clerk's office

722
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,060
and go to the index and right
everybody's name down and these names

723
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,810
appear on a blacklist that used by many
landlords

724
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,220
in New York City but also apparently
throughout the rest the country

725
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,490
um and that's a process where you're
supposed to be able to you

726
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,930
approach your government and get help
from people who are you know maybe

727
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,879
taking advantage you whether you're the
landlord and the tenant

728
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,450
I clearly it's a symmetrically balanced
in this situation get a banned word

729
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,140
so I wonder so many yourself who is
concerned with that kind of data

730
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,660
week you know affecting your life and
not leaving it where would you even

731
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,170
begin to

732
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,890
if you needed a good house in court how
would you even begin to address

733
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,259
something like this great

734
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,200
hums you know back if you you need it
you like how would you protect yourself

735
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,460
is amused

736
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,370
trying to decipher you're trying to cut
down on that data trail

737
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,580
I give you found very clever solutions
to these problems so far

738
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,990
as you've been given a talk I'm
wondering how how far can ago

739
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,339
yeah I can't go that far really I mean
there's not a problem is that um

740
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,080
challenging the government Cup count me
in town in court requires you to use

741
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,460
your real name and that is something
that

742
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,410
you know courts have been struggling
with I'm for a long time because there

743
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,930
was always the Serta

744
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:13,330
obscurity a just by the virtue is hard
to go to court and look up stuff but as

745
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,420
things have become

746
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,660
easier to look up and also at the have
become businesses

747
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,649
around going and getting early access to
data

748
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,290
am you have the East really unfortunate
struggles

749
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,120
where you know somebody like me who's a
journalist who's really in favor a free

750
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,560
speech and transparency might be tempted
argue

751
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,700
against right public I'm

752
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,680
exposure to those names and yet I don't
think that's right solution I actually

753
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,220
don't think that crap clamping down and
making

754
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,430
those records secret is right solution I
think that

755
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,740
making a criminal to have a blacklist is

756
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,399
the solution great I know and people say
to me like okay you live in is a mere

757
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,520
utopian dream land but I'm just saying
that this

758
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,430
the fact it is that's what the but I'd
that's where I think you have to

759
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,470
draw the line and I think that you know
we have to think that's where my staples

760
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,120
example comes in which is we haven't
thought

761
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,279
enough about data usage and we're gonna
draw the lines on that

762
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,880
restricting it last question

763
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,310
pretot thinking um you alluded to not be
able to envision

764
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,610
how your name might be used on lister
has some other work that you do later

765
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,660
might be used in I suspect that you
probably can envision some other ways in

766
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,180
which

767
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,370
your research on could land you in hot
water but

768
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,319
more than that um in this climate in
here a lot in the post known

769
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,440
our world about how you know on

770
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,300
government is clamping down on
journalists and even even before that

771
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,180
really you know whenever

772
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,350
the weekend at the OJ was tapping arm
journalists on capitol hill

773
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,470
armed has in your personal experience
has that world changed is the world

774
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,069
journalism different today than it was
prior to Snowdon and if so

775
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,640
in what ways and is it is it is it a bad
thing

776
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,100
coming for um freedom speech and for the
press

777
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,529
on what your personal thought on that
app I it do you think it's bad

778
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,640
mean some you know what I say a of NS
that

779
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,830
I talked a lot about it says he really
are skeptical

780
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,620
should I care about privacy the
documents they don't care about staples

781
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,299
it ok if they're not convinced they
won't be on the no fly list

782
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,360
but the thing that I it say to them and
I was a

783
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,800
to you guys is that the thing people
should care about

784
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,820
is freedom of the press because we

785
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,400
are the watchdogs democracy and if we
can't do our jobs

786
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,240
then there's no one watching anymore and
the truth is we're getting perilously

787
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,859
close to that moment

788
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,110
because there's no way to have a
conversation with the source

789
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,230
in which you can assure them that they
will remain anonymous

790
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,350
now if you think back to mark felt

791
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,770
deep threat right that was a secret that
was capped

792
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:49,040
for thirty years okay efforts no doubt
himself after three

793
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,750
days because they were already police at
his house and away

794
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,480
right and he knew he would be caught and
in fact

795
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,670
I'm not sure that I can commence a
source that we I would ever be able to

796
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,690
keep a 30-year secret I don't have any
commitment to keep a three-day secret

797
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,010
so then you know world the people who
are willing to move to Russia

798
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,160
but like that's not a lot of people

799
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,690
so it's a terrible time for journalists
and I have tried

800
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,540
a million different ways to you get
sources to use encryption and do

801
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,660
you know but none of these tools are
easy to use and also all them can be

802
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,460
broken

803
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,110
and we know that the and I say when it's
fine to you they would and in fact

804
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,850
even worse than the NSA is the fact that
every single employer

805
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,940
no matter how drinking Inc has the right
to you

806
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,420
break all their employees could you know
communications and so

807
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,240
it's very hard to convince anyone to
leak in its been a terrible

808
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,500
on spent terrible time for Charles II
the Senate bill might also where the

809
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,780
canary in the coalmine

810
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,010
you know where the beginning and I don't
wanna see the end of that I want it to

811
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:52,420
stop that we have time for one more

812
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,000
we're not we're done it think im hm
