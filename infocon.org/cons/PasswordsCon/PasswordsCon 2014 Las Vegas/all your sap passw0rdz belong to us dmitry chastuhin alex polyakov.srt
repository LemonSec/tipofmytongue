00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,040
and on this light in the neck lateral a
publisher's encryption keys

147

missus or something like that I'll I'll
because I would get you

150
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:52,029
all this key and chill for descriptions
if you wanna

151
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,110
and cost little

152

beauty history tables this is also no
idea about

158
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,420
a as a bee user passports

159
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,160
is tables s appease store all
information about user

Mon dont name passport s at the Trop

161
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,379
so if an attacker can resist tables she
will get a lot of interesting

information

163

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,660
to you of rubles called from AP

166
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,740
yet GH II first

167
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,569
a fight with that upholding I don't
recommend to use

168
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:59,149
artist s use olive tossed hrs of
passports

169
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,589
and do not use do not see a different
case in CT

170
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,939
that's what the this has very easy to
fruit

171
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,959
other of them based on that

172
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,229
Shae one I'll Hayden by the way

173
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,730
you'll still can use it as a performer

174
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,350
bring them don't

175
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,500
few prevention

176
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,670
notes how to protect

177
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,740
is a test not so interesting go next

178
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,889
a bus for from RFC request

179
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,230
RFC it is the one function

180
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,290
call are have seen it for communication

181
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,449
a different need for cognition

182
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:46,899
between different SAP system SAP and non
SAP system and of course

183
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,079
for executing some users request so this
bill SB

184
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,849
usurp see Chris very often this whole

185
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,439
a ritzy request looks as you can see

186
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:02,579
I hope to see a

187
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,870
all data just meet without encryption

188
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,679
you can see username function name but
you will not see his apostles

189
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,550
because only use a passport was included
by default

190
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,109
a and yes I set

191
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,730
if an attack a real intercepts the
receipt requested

192
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,309
Logan data he'll be happy because he got
on

193
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:29,889
the look and parts or but after the
understand the possibly

194
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,379
not clear text because also just and
keep it

195
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:37,329
and after to experiment we found as a

196
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,349
a game so reels for encryption

197
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,439
and against tech Tiki so

198
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,769
that's why it's issue intercept a

199
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,819
arson requested a include possible so
you can easily the crib some

200
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,050
for secure system just use

201
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,969
are and SNC

202
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,199
the next class certification me she'll
be

203
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,500
described it to use SB usual
administrator

204
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,550
a special administrator it is a remote
tool for controlling

205
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,750
day 2 engine issues a

206
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,639
in SAP system this tool use a proper

207
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,600
d4 protocol and by default all day to
trust me

208
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,649
in cleartext except passports this whole

209
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,400
a protocol looks like

210
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,990
a because is on mister to

211
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,400
is that job application we can easily
the compile them

212
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,220
and the stent which include shins used a
and again thanks all their

213
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,240
us you can see all possible or

214
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,390
Charles so troops try to check so they
do

215
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,390
a a and once again the key is hot caught
it

216
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,350
and all there some 0 his old mister
turns a

217
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,200
the same

218
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,010
and go to the sever site

219
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,830
a ok journalistic stopped fifty outlaw

220
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,250
security storage

221
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,010
what is it I secure to store it is

222
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,770
this is placed a reached job the kitchen
scherer

223
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,460
use for storing tissue deformation like
a

224
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,320
database users name and it it is
possible

225
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,850
database connection information and
administrator user

226
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,050
for that and admits that the user name

227
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,069
and passport of a.s.a.p

228
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,770
user on the operating system

229
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,360
security storage place on the filesystem

230
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,490
a in file sex store bought properties a
slut you can see

231
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,840
the default hoff to this file so all

232
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,850
looks on on this file you can see the
world

233
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,510
worth like a host passport et cetera but
the value of this

234
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,610
thinks is in critical a

235
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,940
hours such souls foreign trip to fun
captions

236
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,660
as a bee UAL's tripod Esfahani okay

237
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,780
not all probably we need to keep for to
keep show

238
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:24,060
this top a there's a my problem of job
security storage

239
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,140
the key file is like it is the same
directory

240
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,069
our thing keep the data in file sex talk
talkie that's why and

241
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,530
if attacker can read and keep that
phosphors

242
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,520
and if Tiger can read a foundation pit

243
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,829
data he also is a weekend read the key
for to keep tolls atop

244
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,460
if you look deeper on this key file

245
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,560
we'll see it consists of two parts: rush
information

246
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,729
and and preferred key phrase mission
information

247
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,220
depending all version there tribal

248
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,510
de ski maybe change for example if
version

249
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,810
and of defiles up of seven point

250
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,880
0 this mean she equal key phrase

251
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,390
blast that's a deal SAP the next one

252
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,000
is encrypt it she prays by default

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,920
are it is initial possible or reach that
mister to assess

254
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,699
setup during a a sufficient installation

255
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,250
orphans phrase equal to the database
boss for

256
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,190
or and s at the administrator possible
account possible

257
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,380
for encrypting the key phrase so relate
to

258
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,110
restate the key is used to getting a

259
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,520
that's why if an attacker a

260
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,840
only got the sex product key file

261
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,280
with a group to praise the the can also
get

262
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,439
access intra-city because the help

263
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:05,360
then shop oscalus okay now have zinc
could possible or from 6.0 abruptness

264
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,929
files and we have a the cupid key from

265
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,630
file 6.0 sixth ordered key

266
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,740
at now we can try to keep data from
sixth or

267
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,470
secure distorts and successfully do it

268
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,350
that set on

269
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,599
Data Sync you could buy their tripod s
haha written

270
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,719
in CBC more jews into secret cave ish is
derived from a possible please

271
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,980
it's a she hash operating the key is the
key

272
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,830
Press from 6.0 turkey class SAT

273
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,120
as assault is 0 that's all

274
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,239
very easy we all saw wrote a tool which
decrypts

275
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,700
all this stuff from as a pizza
obligation secured a storage

276
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,470
successfully use the on

277
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,740
are a Sharpie pen test its assets are
easily

278
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,300
to follow %uh a little bitty we shall
all storied any file from the server

279
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600
read this to who filed too cute bus
force

280
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,790
and pull which affects to database and

281
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:16,370
who the compromise as a PA system also
supposed to go to store spark a half

282
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,050
miles or

283
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,710
name like a gf grade both properties

284
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,950
and store other interesting information
like a pass for

285
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,320
from assert the operating system user
name that a baseball source

286
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,010
some his name's and passport from a

287
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,950
SAP little bit about prevention

288
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,250
installs is knowles at calls for six

289
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,100
route except as a critical files the
next one thinks

290
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,600
I looking trespass as a beacon right

291
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,669
lot of locks an administrator can

292
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,840
define which looks and the verbose to
level of this locks

293
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,830
on if attacker carrot locks for example
love ya

294
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,270
as a PM shift for example she confound
many interesting

295
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,930
thinks in lock files for my son but she
still information about the user's

296
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,010
permission

297
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,950
if such information up but had mistaken

298
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,480
but administrator a a set can't
configure

299
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,510
logging up

300
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,220
a by the way is that the systems

301
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,260
I just a few places where Los

302
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,570
store a

303
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,700
does not depend on the desirous
administrator

304
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,890
for example up lock files

305
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,790
from as the be used a his directory

306
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,990
this is this do to restore the files
which

307
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,490
used during espy's collision processes
and

308
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,350
is this folder a technical fault
managers think look files

309
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,230
let's see on this files their typical ok
files from his dick during

310
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,460
as you can see the passport is replaced

311
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,650
okay goes electoral yeah

312
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,710
looks better attacked her farts a
cleartext username

313
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,130
and pa sports in look files but be
honest

314
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,300
a distress and are not happen so often

315
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,440
so da next this is

316
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,920
morial station wish list she very often

317
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,350
in as a the locks up passport is a group
that

318
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,399
getting guess what type of encryption is
used

319
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,980
right again XO round against the keys
headquarter and others all to help but

320
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,480
to keep door

321
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,440
of possible for all home SRP looks files

322
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,890
a lot of critical user names and lot of
are

323
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,130
bustles be confined on this looks

324
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,650
was a sad story with some out a curated

325
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,420
config files you can aren't a

326
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,930
a lot of untreated locks passport and
looks

327
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,240
I goes in next

328
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,820
the SP models a a soul G a Saudi is that
central information repository for

329
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,320
SAP system landscape a it contains
information about

330
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,060
technical system landscapes business
system products

331
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,450
a to rock so of course the SEL didn't
have

332
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,380
at Copic file it names is assault the
best .co G

333
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,970
and its store information about user
name user possible hostname and

334
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,930
for 280 and all this stuff is equiped by

335
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,080
desecrating is early versions

336
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,040
of facility his older brother some on
and you personally use

337
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,490
a tripod SO HARD by default for
encryption

338
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,480
as abuse default have got a key a part
of this key you

339
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,840
consensus light but if

340
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,429
but user can or but

341
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,380
mister can change the default she

342
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,760
but if she change the default key

343
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,960
secure be for randomly generated and
real being

344
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
safe us asleep this

345
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,889
dot key gives you talkin and place

346
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,070
near as a thank you to deter and again
we can read the file you can keep the

347
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,570
data

348
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,760
a reads a key view and keep that key

349
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,290
so this was a key is not a problem a

350
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,670
assert is the latest version of sold the
and as of late misuses

351
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,250
tribal dispute how to cut its key little
bit about prevention

352
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,260
okay goals a

353
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,650
place where AB East text or sensitive
information

354
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,960
ABAP security storage the security
stores

355
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,700
is company and of SRP application server

356
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,040
it allows sandpaper storage

357
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,790
all since you today to the certification
required well looking into

358
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,159
other system like a exceeded the nation
exchange principle in

359
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,730
exchange infrastructure to Supaul sup
contact

360
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,010
et cetera and all his data store

361
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,210
is included in as at the table are sick
top

362
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,870
a hard to get access into a database

363
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,479
a lot of ways exist if an attacker can
execute operating system comment on

364
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,860
precipice ever that mean his chest
opportunity to connect to database

365
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,290
is out and it credentials and after that

366
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,780
she is a liquor read table sucked up

367
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,410
house /a /p

368
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,679
a creep that his data in security stores

369
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,630
first all SP great a this structure

370
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,870
in different Vishal depressed I

371
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,250
structure a a

372
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,740
the says data also included some
additional information like a

373
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,620
saúde use this number and some magic
values

374
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,340
reach will be used later this how

375
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,560
this structure looks starts with random
numbers

376
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,010
after that pale alt and after this on
CNN just check sums

377
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,920
and SAT foreign trip so the

378
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,260
chapel this whole Creighton uses a

379
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,650
the this you the freemen meh thought the
for

380
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,880
22 four bytes keys

381
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,390
a is supplied from you the

382
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,700
free desecration in the sequence and
creep creep creep

383
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,750
with the free different keys okay

384
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,820
a the frisky will be buy it for a while

385
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,950
28 the 2nd Q bias from 92

386
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,929
16 and therefore by but

387
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:07,230
from 17 224 and to round up the troops
since

388
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,530
first-round thats must a

389
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,560
while was a step by step in creep on it

390
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,200
hot of our data rate is around a breath
expert Lord

391
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,370
but lost lamb at the Trop a

392
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,770
q4 first-round encryption key rate

393
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,820
then ironically and best salsa default
key you reach

394
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,159
sort we've md5 hash all

395
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,800
saúde of the system and installation
number

396
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,080
about as a default key I will tell

397
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,720
a bit later soft as a first-round we got

398
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,150
this picture as a bigger Potro Day to
all reading keep it

399
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,179
but popped all zzzz

400
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,800
misuse for generating first G still
unclear text

401
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,950
that's why with a second round of
encryption

402
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,090
ask GS abuse default key value

403
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,379
and as a result after a second-round
we'll get encrypt the data

404
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,810
and all this day to place all a.s.a.p
table

405
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,580
sick top what about a default key

406
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,980
if you simply did via type on this
YouTube

407
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,160
to but the key for his inclusion

408
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,280
is hardcore that source that this is
some store

409
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,550
and Cupid he and before first-round to
creep this key

410
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,210
you think another hardcore titty mmm
this how we can

411
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,330
you'll get default you value after that
we can to keep the second round of

412
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,629
untreated

413
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,810
a of encryption and as a result we get
information please allow us

414
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,190
generate a second key and to keep
first-round

415
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,990
and we get clear text data from

416
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,770
ABAP security storage

417
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,370
the protect and prevention is very
easily

418
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,320
you need just change the default keep
but in my practice nobody

419
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,070
love it okay let's go to another
interesting table

420
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,600
DB column table as you know is that it
has a connection with a different

421
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,500
database and Mistretta can't manage this
connection

422
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,090
via the transaction DBC all and we'll
get information up

423
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,360
from database some kinda of

424
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,770
artistic all database condition
information

425
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,010
misused in PB so transaction I'll is

426
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,140
sorting people is the table the beast

427
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,630
the become a lets you know the stable

428
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,130
that's how beast you pick on table looks

429
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,040
information about connection username
and possible cost

430
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,520
and others liked you can see example
often encrypt data

431
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,900
saw for keeps and used this heightened a

432
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,060
after encryption as a result is encoded
using

433
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,300
base 64 Creighton a

434
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,100
the key issues for encryption again is
headquartered

435
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,310
on you can see all on the slide

436
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,389
a

437
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,280
and and this a she's equal on different
as a PA system

438
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,810
that's why we can easily use it all the
Pentecost

439
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,520
with bellowed also encrypt static salt
helping

440
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,300
and the about prevention

441
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,830
as a last as a few models recital
describe it

442
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,280
it it is one of the new SAP product in
memory database

443
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,450
SAP HANA I don't have enough time

444
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,590
for reviewing the system just go to bus
40 shows

445
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,899
a lot of interesting things a how to
store

446
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,120
in is deepest door

447
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,540
a a it SUV's our store

448
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,080
a it is kinda all SAP ABAP secure
distorts

449
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,370
the publication of this torch is on the
screen

450
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,260
a all information place in file

451
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,050
SF is to be towed it asking

452
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,450
a BP secure storage Hana used law

453
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,970
toppled s how her into and what
interesting how to use

454
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,470
a for kitchens the same diff of quality

455
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,970
%uh what kind of information we can
found into storage

456
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,590
except the possible worlds as a set s
behind in

457
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,879
it is a in memory database that's why
out to cast your permission from

458
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,440
db file from file system

459
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,590
you can still this information buzz away
I

460
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,340
Hannah drop some data

461
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,939
in 20 power system backups and safe
points

462
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,700
after power fail

463
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,600
database can a come their start like

464
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,030
entities based database and to toss to
it last

465
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,620
consistent state from safe points

466
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,709
that's why I Hannah provide

467
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,120
data all im a group and we shall out to
administrator

468
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,929
thanked and creeped no volume using

469
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,620
I it's a heightened and four decryption
William

470
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Hannah use persistent corruption anarchy
and

471
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,280
this main things where the key is a
store

472
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,620
right Anna in file

473
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,689
as a ser is to be dot that and

474
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,730
this how attacker can really get to the
root key

475
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,460
and bypass Olympics in also

476
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,500
some internal she plays the the ustasha

477
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,730
saying some internals it that requests

478
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,630
yeah

479
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,160
to means okay little bit about
prevention

480
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,960
on the slide and finally I want to say
it

481
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,090
don't have enough time to step all
