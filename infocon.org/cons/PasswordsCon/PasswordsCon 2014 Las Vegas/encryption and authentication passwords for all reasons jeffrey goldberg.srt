00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,719
here you really don't know what you're
asking your year

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
reactor

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,759
the city like blackmail watching yes yes
many times

5
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:21,869
you know or here

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,310

mom

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,479
working

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,739
been

27
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:11,939
mines now your

28
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,870
hands you'll

29
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,060
yeah well

30
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,510
been okay it looks like

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,370
time to begin I Jeffrey Goldberg arm

32
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,750
I work for agile bitch the makers upon
password

33
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,709
bombing I'm gonna say I'm a lot

34
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,630
and I

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,820
right talk has a title there has switch
for all reasons authentication password

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,070
to not the same up but I'm

37
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,320
as encryption passwords and this is
something that I actually

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,019
assume that almost everybody here
already knows

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,720
but I see so many mistakes made about it

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,040
that I'm going to just

41
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
just assumed every sliding here has to
keep watch

42
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,209
I am you know so so it it's I

43
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,670
I'm hammering home familiar concepts

44
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,780
okay some good actually begin with the
story I'll

45
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,970
in our

46
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,640
a few years back Chelsea Manning

47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,250
I'll meet huge amount of information to
WikiLeaks

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,930
I am and then WikiLeaks had it

49
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,790
I am and here I'm gonna talk
specifically about the diplomatic cables

50
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,959
I'll are

51
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,690
WikiLeaks kinda does its own little

52
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,440
editorial process hosts a few I am

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,440
on bits and pieces claiming his
insurance they post a huge

54
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,220
up PGP encrypted file

55
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,040
and I they're not able to

56
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,040
some journalist persuades them that wiki
leaks isn't in a position to do kind of

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,959
the journalistic

58
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,080
editing and revealing your feelings and
%uh

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,160
I I'll

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,250
gives the encryption password to

61
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,399
journalist at The Guardian I david levy

62
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,120
and then the Guardian and some other
papers from that

63
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,280
star publishing some more these things
again all selected

64
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,580
I'll and redacted and during this time

65
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,909
copies are that interested file are
still circulating around

66
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,910
I'll ferret torrents of its

67
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,260
and in February

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,000
I 2011 I

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,150
David Lee and Nick Cooper published a
book describing his

70
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,539
interactions with %ah should which
WikiLeaks

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,870
and I says a sound shrunk down on a
scrapbook paper

72
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,400
I a collection of history since 1966 to
the present day

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,929
hey ash that's the past where he said

74
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,300
but you have to add one extra

75
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,180
word when you type it in you have to put
in the word diplomatic

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,860
before the where history you and

77
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,120
it actually truck are almost half a year
for at least people

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,210
publicly we don't know

79
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,500
what was going on privately for people
connect to connect

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,760
the password that was revealed in that
book

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,400
with this pgp file that it's been kind
of circulating around

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,940
I'm but at the end of August I

83
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,030
this was publicly put together I'll

84
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,099
all of that data which neither the
guardian or wiki leaks and certainly not

85
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,200
the US government

86
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,259
out wanted made public

87
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,050
I'll and we have this sort of %ah

88
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,199
excerpts from I

89
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,430
exchanges going back and forced I'll
wiki leaks

90
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,300
posted that it was betrayed by I the
Guardian

91
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,639
I'll a Guardian journalist has

92
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,030
in a victory me isley undetected active
gross negligence or malice and in

93
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,770
violation of a sign security agreement
with the Guardian's editor in chief

94
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,990
disclosed hops secret decryption
passwords to the entire

95
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,580
unredacted WikiLeaks Cablegate arc I

96
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,258
we've already spoken to the State
Department and commenced

97
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,629
tree litigation action we will use the
formal statement and eat

98
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:49,610
Duke or so we can presume that WikiLeaks
was not

99
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,360
happy about the holes unredacted

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,960
complete I the trip shin and publication
are back

101
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,150
I the Guardian

102
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,270
I I'm in an interview with try

103
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,710
Kim Zetter wires I'll said

104
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,258
I'll we note that although

105
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:16,550
the book did reveal the past rates it
did not reveal the location of the file

106
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,300
and that the Sun had told the paper she
that it was a

107
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,080
Jan past which would expire and be
deleted

108
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,310
in a matter Bowers it was a meaningless

109
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,620
piece to be information except any
except for the person's

110
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,379
who created the database now

111
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,830
this well

112
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,300
let me just say I'll Matt plays Roach

113
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,050
a really nice really short

114
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,180
I'll post about this whole thing and in
a sense

115
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,300
my talk is suggesting expanding I but
Matt blaze it said those years ago

116
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,349
everything else aside the recent wiki
leaks Guardian fiasco nicely

117
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,690
demonstrates an important crypto logical
principal

118
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,969
the security properties I've she is used
for authentication

119
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,120
are not a and

120
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,789
those used for D trip Shin are quite get
rich

121
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,419
and

122
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,180
out the emphasis is he is and

123
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,580
arm and then he concludes this

124
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,800
wish it might be tempting for us

125
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,039
as cryptography research and security
engineers to snicker

126
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,529
at both wiki leaks and a guardian for
the sloppy practices

127
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,529
that allowed this high-stakes mishap

128
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,990
to have happened in the first place
sheesh but we should also be search

129
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,420
the confusion between the semantics

130
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,319
about sent a cation and confidentiality
she happens

131
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,370
because these are in fact subtle

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,410
concepts that are poorly understood

133
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,620
that are is poorly understood as they
are intertwined

134
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,339
she even among those who might be
laughing the hardest

135
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,250
cell

136
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,380
arm I'll

137
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,170
the anorexics

138
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,579
appointing this talk is that
authentication is not the same as

139
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,339
encryption

140
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,810
she passwords used for 1/2 different
security properties then passed which

141
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,138
used sure the

142
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,389
other different search attacks different
sources relevant offenses

143
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:36,250
I different behaviors most people

144
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,339
and you can't blame them do not see the
difference at all

145
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,120
and a lot of people even in this

146
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,769
you know even in this room see you know
the difference when

147
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,529
asked about it but still when they start
thinking about what you

148
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,600
what you do with passwords I may not
always be making the distinctions

149
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,410
when it's most useful and confusion
leads to exploitable

150
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,240
error as we saw in in that cable gates

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,279
case um before I go on is everybody
clear

152
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,389
how back Cablegate case is an instance
of confusion between an authentication

153
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,829
and encryption password

154
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,349
okay I'm

155
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,550
not Casey gonna get lots of kittens
except kittens is

156
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,640
my dog Molly who's not really very
bright

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
I'll okay and of

158
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,510
everything I say here is very rough
characterization I'm not attempting to

159
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,839
provide definitions

160
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
have anything last year I was really
become a formal definitions

161
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,930
lots amassed did my slides la tech

162
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,089
I'll I'll this year I promise no match

163
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,390
anyway I'm so very roughly speaking
authentication is the process in which

164
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,149
approver demonstrates to a verifier

165
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:03,339
that the trooper is who or what they
claim to be and so

166
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm I'll i'm penelope

167
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,550
let me get my stuff

168
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,829
I'll vincent's Bear fire what's your
password

169
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,850
my password is X Y Z Z Y is

170
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,040
I anybody else year old enough to
recognize that

171
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,510
EA II correct I'm letting you in and
then there's a room locked away where

172
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,189
Vincent

173
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,050
controlled access to the room and let's
Penelope

174
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,229
into are precious to us and

175
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,850
here we go encryption uses a key

176
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,170
derives from password in this discussion

177
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,329
obviously talking about passwords and
transforms meaningful

178
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,589
data plain text yeah I into stuff that's

179
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,680
indistinguishable from random and 0

180
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,900
that whilst Chile I hate transitions
like that ice playing around with

181
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,350
something

182
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,470
didn't eliminate the decrease Shane

183
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,029
iight news is the key to transform the
data

184
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,420
the cipher text back into plain text and
then it got

185
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,890
H

186
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,090
pictures pics I molly is

187
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,410
more connected to this picture that now
I'm than in the other ones

188
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,350
I in encryption you've got a password

189
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,510
she derivation function produces a key
arm

190
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,640
and the key is used for the detection

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,060
or encryption operation which transforms
data from Penelope East

192
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,489
pressure stuffs to

193
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,640
a tard so I am

194
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I figure that i'm gonna be remembered
for having trap slotched

195
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,010
UK and

196
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,390
so in each case is a password

197
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,080
but its actually doing very different
its and so in encryption password is

198
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
password

199
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,410
used to encryption an authentication
password is the password used for

200
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,469
authentication I and

201
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,670
that should be pretty clear now from a
user's point of view

202
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,180
authentication they

203
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,910
enter the correct password and then they
do stuff that they wouldn't have been

204
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,839
able to do otherwise with some data

205
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,050
now let's see what this is like each
with encryption

206
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,099
CD user enter the correct password

207
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,820
and then does stuff with some data or
whatever that they wouldn't

208
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,950
otherwise I have been able to do so we
can't really blame

209
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,170
users for not knowing the difference
between

210
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,510
an encryption password and a nurse
education passing

211
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,370
david levy probably had never used an
encryption password

212
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,290
prior to that pgp file so how was he

213
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,630
to know to treat that has spurred she
differently

214
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,780
then he treated any retreat any other
password that hat

215
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,060
he was told was gonna go away and

216
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,089
I are metaphors

217
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,810
we talked for infection she and
unlocking don't actually

218
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,739
work really well true encryption I'm in

219
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,590
meets basic %eh proves to the lock

220
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,000
that it's the right Keech I

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,730
and when it unlock something it
transforms this state if the lock

222
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,720
so that access is granted to some
resources I

223
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,820
in encryption the key is used

224
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,210
I to transform the actual data and
unlocking

225
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,740
is the actual transforming but these are
really good metaphors

226
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,790
are decent metaphors when it comes to
authentication

227
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,870
the he and meet space

228
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,090
troops to proves to the lock fits right
he

229
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,540
sheehy in authentication

230
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,910
it proves to the Bear fire that it's the
right

231
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,819
secrets and unlocking is transforming
this state of the law

232
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,930
in meet space and unlocking or logging
in

233
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,189
I with an authentication system

234
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,710
is transforming the state up to their
fire

235
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,850
so that access will be granted to some
resources

236
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,110
now here

237
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,440
are some differences in how these things
behavior now

238
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,690
everything I say here is needs to be
taken with

239
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,190
knowledge that there are lots of
exceptions and fine points

240
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,380
on all up these are really rough
characterizations trick typical

241
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,020
or possibly exaggerated cases because in
fact most systems

242
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,740
how involve some hybrid between
authentication and encryption and it can

243
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,000
be done in different ways

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,470
I'll a password change with an
authentication system

245
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,880
behaves as you expect the old password

246
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,960
is useless after

247
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,840
arm after you change a password I am

248
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,660
this is not always the case with
encryption

249
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,300
I'll likewise

250
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,019
arm you can blue boat somebody's access

251
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:32,300
arm often by change the past which
pretty much in instances the same thing

252
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,139
we finna them to cation system I'll

253
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:41,470
rethink reaction I again it doesn't work
I'll

254
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,800
that same way I'll you can

255
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,459
have a password reset mechanism with an
authentication system

256
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,510
you can tell your been since

257
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,889
that okay we're now going to allow it
different passwords from now a pic

258
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,839
arm you there's no password reset

259
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,850
mechanism for encryption

260
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,980
okay I am forward secrecy let me just

261
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,069
leave that too late it's a passion 120

262
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,250
lot about that later I how depends on
how much time I leave myself

263
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,329
I'll ok but just going back to this

264
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,790
arm

265
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,770
how many people have pgp

266
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,740
or SSH he password she parties

267
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,810
okay wenis how many view

268
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,770
have every have changed those passwords

269
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,490
since you first created them mom

270
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,980
okay think those have you to change
those passwords and she first created

271
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,270
them

272
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,460
arm

273
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,030
are you aware

274
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,560
that their chest encrypting she

275
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,190
that that incensed the old passwords is
still good against the Alt key files

276
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,190
so if somebody gotta she filed a long
time ago

277
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,250
not gorgeous word right here

278
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,960
years he long now I'm not remember but
you keep

279
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,890
average mom

280
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,740
the the passphrase for your SSH private
key

281
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,419
I can

282
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:33,270
were

283
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,990
kidney generates a key jaggers and

284
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,809
you act the old you via acquire back out
your

285
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,240
you'll in yet

286
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,100
writers white your destination exactly
relied red

287
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,480
okay hearted check up on that's a i'm ok
I'm

288
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,210
I'm confused about that example okay but
with PGP

289
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,880
I'll when you change your past raise

290
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,340
your pgp private she you are not
changing that

291
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,209
sheets that he is

292
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,340
the key that was there when it was
generated and so

293
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,689
I am no be I'll

294
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,880
buyer word waiting yes it does

295
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,980
your your Res your year your has access

296
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,350
your all your had require

297
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,139
regenerate are while year were yo

298
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,230
row okay so so there's a key revocation
mechanism in the past which H

299
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,299
okay okay

300
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,440
I does so much for my example

301
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,669
sure I am that's fine your

302
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:54,100
your euro your

303
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,600
the now know it's if somebody captures
you she file

304
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,459
suppose you set up a chief I'll

305
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,940
with a weak password marr

306
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,240
your good

307
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,750
0 only I'll get then do forward secrecy
in the SSH

308
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,809
protocol is a different question and not

309
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,690
she I any and I'm not talking about that
you know

310
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,679
my you on your among your mom

311
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,760
your yumm

312
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,690
that's probably the simplest way of
putting it nice should have put it that

313
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,299
way

314
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,220
your on seen

315
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,820
or yes is this year's 10 reading

316
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,360
were user Eugene lines were

317
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,580
right by tonight so so unless you go
through revocation process

318
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,159
are but okay I

319
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,929
you we've got wires are somebody year
ago

320
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,390
you private G you

321
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,700
he spoke right night 660 so the SSH
protocol doesn't insure

322
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,419
always cheats

323
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:18,320
ok I am now

324
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,928
when it comes the are there ways it
going to round passwords as we all know

325
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,490
army you know and I high-powered

326
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,710
agencies prefer to go around encryption
and through which

327
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:39,190
I and if you're going to round passwords

328
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,210
are if we'd go back shoe that

329
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,879
share I've authentication we've got this
ru

330
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,059
without now a piece precious stuff in it
she

331
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,570
I you could think about that potentially
is let's say

332
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,249
her bank capped I she

333
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:02,049
may very well authorized bank to do
things in that movie

334
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:05,519
so there are other doors into that bloom

335
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,869
other than the one that Vincent carts E

336
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:14,340
on this is often one of the reasons why
want to use an authentication systems

337
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,830
that

338
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,330
trypsin system because it does allow I'm

339
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,739
I think it's too actually nippy late
today to I'll

340
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:25,070
but again they're going to round the
verifier

341
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,450
I am now

342
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,450
I you could do this with encryption

343
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,570
by happened he is a past race escrow

344
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,250
somehow think to in a sense have a way
of going around

345
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,510
I'm going around that process but

346
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,850
that applies as well to authentication

347
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:52,090
so that way I love about weakness in an
encryption system

348
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,289
also flies as a potential weakness in
our

349
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,580
in understand cation system I'll

350
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,770
you can simply try to break that their
fire

351
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,539
as opposed to actually I capturing the
password

352
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,110
and you can try to break the encryption
I'll

353
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,168
typically one is harder than the other

354
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:18,950
I and then both at the systems when you
got data sitting on a client you can go

355
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,090
around the encryption around the
authentication

356
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,158
by all the usual ways and five

357
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:32,159
I've simply grabbing the data on the
client memory dumps but after

358
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,080
authentication

359
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,470
you can have your Vincent

360
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,990
arm engage in some kind of throttle you
know say

361
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,060
okay if you if I get too many requests
from Penelope

362
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,159
within a few seconds I'm just gonna stop
listening to anything

363
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,930
she has to say I'll this is not

364
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,240
an option for an encryption system the

365
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,520
best analog in encryption is to use

366
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,090
arm is to use a costly key derivation

367
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,149
PBK tf2 I'll likewise

368
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,140
something like multi-factor
authentication

369
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,630
is available for authentication systems
it doesn't make any sense at all for an

370
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,950
encryption system whether

371
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,130
is no authentication

372
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,609
if if you got no authentication

373
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:30,019
you don't even have one factor but you
do have

374
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,549
one factor sparsely users concerned and
the

375
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:38,080
analog should that would be she's
splitting out where

376
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,199
I'll I where the key that's derived from
the password might have to be

377
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,690
exhorted with a key that comes from some
other source may be a hardware device

378
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,159
arm things like one-time passwords

379
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,269
I you know passage the change

380
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:59,299
with clock which counter I am

381
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,658
federal often used as second factors
multi-factor authentication

382
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,150
I'm

383
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,410
I don't know says any analog to that or

384
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,220
encryption systems your

385
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,930
orange your or was

386
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,200
was your well

387
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,570
in for you its and your years

388
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,649
the 0 okay

389
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,320
you can throttle something if you have

390
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,129
tamper-proof hardware

391
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:38,269
yes our yes you can't you keep you can
throttle lock out

392
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,399
I'm tamper-proof hardware but

393
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,268
I so were yards but we we we were

394
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:49,070
big but you can't do it if you just have
an intricate file because they don't

395
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,619
have to go through your software

396
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:54,990
you

397
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,240
your Jan okay

398
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,490
um judge now

399
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,710
because these behave differently both in
terms of attacks and defenses

400
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,830
but also because they behave differently
in terms of use our expectations

401
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,519
I'll you know there was a talk earlier
about

402
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,869
she could be changing passwords and

403
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,590
you know our guard changed past which
once a year you may not

404
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,629
you wanting to do that for encryption
passwords

405
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,678
in less you revoking she's in the
process

406
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,460
I'll so

407
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,820
all I this size left completely open

408
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,100
are almost completely open I'm educate
uses about the distinction

409
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,929
I don't think that's

410
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,930
gonna be easy are likely

411
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,670
arm I've tried to make encryption
behaved more like authentication to try

412
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:59,050
to get it to behave in the way that
users will expect remain counter these

413
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,820
kinds a passer rating systems

414
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,879
on and that's kind of part of designing
tools to discourage

415
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,980
mistakes like we saw with the wish

416
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,430
Cablegate and one of the things

417
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:18,700
arm are in this day in the second point
but making encryption behave more like a

418
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,530
fence cation

419
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,730
she is exactly like what you described

420
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,170
where when you change your password sure
your past range to your PG PG

421
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,380
it starts to automate or semi-automated

422
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,910
I she revocation I'm process

423
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,440
and I that I that then gets some %uh

424
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,490
the hines of semantics people expect I'm

425
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,050
from I from authentic Asian

426
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,090
and but mostly exposed

427
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,360
these I'm another thing is in one
Password

428
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,240
we're looking at away to apply for which
secrecy

429
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm with H master password change

430
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,500
but we don't have that at the moment and

431
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,380
that does not fit with I use our
expectations

432
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,720
so we consider this a problem from a
problem

433
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,250
where you your

434
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,620
you are allowed yeah naked

435
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,639
safeguards wherever you go location
because occasion

436
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't have data whereas encryption

437
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,130
I've actually go the you but every
considered

438
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,200
everything about it short ok what about
you

439
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,260
you're not wrong with years so

440
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,290
year the iraqi I actually physically
have

441
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,440
but don't have unit cell so that's why
right

442
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,980
years or white nation what it actually
is

443
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,140
is a grid but so

444
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,710
differences the with right yeah I'm II

445
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,430
don't have the actual dater medications

446
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,750
like what you're talking about or runs
the door where

447
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,590
whatever got because although doers
replicating

448
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,020
based data words while yet I can just
keep

449
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,090
recovery creating a and then running
workforce rumors pack

450
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,280
think that's why these fail true right

451
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,040
right so that's why things like
throttling lockout are and

452
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,610
normally ballot that's why things like
troubling lockout are normally battle

453
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,189
recorded

454
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,190
or

455
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,669
I encrypt data I'd like to note their
questions or comments from

456
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:35,940
anyone else you from

457
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,010
orange youths you

458
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,200
how was your I'll you never your and
that nurture

459
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,350
is you used homes Ravi you never ever

460
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,860
removing all you maize grain

461
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,770
so was your you need remembered years
she denounced

462
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,120
is even more pressure Younes you

463
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,539
housing and Hong

464
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:07,289
you group bode well yes that's what we
need to communicate to people

465
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:10,309
but how are we going to communicate that

466
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,450
shoe to people I mean it judge

467
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,150
you know I don't know what the actual
conversation between Lee and assigns was

468
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,400
but it sounded to me like neither was
particularly

469
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,380
clear on the concept yes worldly wise
Bernard

470
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,710
years were gauge right by you

471
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,120
you right right so he

472
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,809
I i mean are in later statements he said
that

473
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:40,899
that he thought he was gonna take the
file down

474
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,400
but that's still not really it

475
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm cited your everything

476
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,210
I think renewing about exam

477
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,909
for forget your in

478
00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:00,020
is occasion but or you just tell see
this and any

479
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,090
you membership programs

480
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,330
does order on and/or

481
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,658
doesn't book over

482
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,400
another his ok that good UV

483
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,780
your ok global venue

484
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,789
and during raids or the

485
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:23,950
great UK yeah

486
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,490
yes so that's a distinction that people
have some experience Nexus ok said the

487
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,510
suggestion was

488
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,549
base your education of the fact that

489
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,510
one kinda password can be be set and the
other is a few

490
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,390
lose it it's gone forever and and that's
a distinction

491
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,450
more people are familiar with so you can
use that to help

492
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,190
heated to help guide I

493
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,220
thats um you had a question out sorry I
can't go on

494
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,210
you sure

495
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm was that I can your question or not

496
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,390
now what okay I am

497
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,789
mmm yards

498
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:09,010
in is yell

499
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,679
absolutely you yes right

500
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,950
and that correlates with this
distinction that I'm trying to make

501
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,390
but again and there could have been a
key escrow kinder system which would

502
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,880
have allowed some kind

503
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,970
how to reach so it's not that
distinction so they may need

504
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,929
are do our differences are really hard
and fast you can always designing

505
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:36,059
systems that are kinda exceptions to
everything

506
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,158
point that I said but still there is
this essential distinction

507
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,250
and it was good or

508
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:50,039
great prospects mile I i mean i i wasnt
recommending escrow services I was just

509
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,269
I he s persistence I was just pointing
out you know you know I was just

510
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:55,190
pointing out

511
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,379
that it's not always the case

512
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:02,139
that's I that the distinction between

513
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:07,379
encryption past which and authentication
password she matches

514
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:10,639
up with what happens if you forget your
password

515
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:14,570
typically at Dutch but just saying

516
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,689
third going to be cases where that

517
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,509
isn't going to be I'm fully diagnostic

518
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:25,049
oMG in said

519
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,269
wrong you

520
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:32,730
you some Louis

521
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,739
in

522
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:38,779
GE are arm

523
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:44,059
had you know it could be felt that way
in which case it gets more like

524
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,070
like that authentication about

525
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,789
physical yeah the IronKey I'll

526
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:54,210
but in one respect are

527
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,809
you know as we saw if arm

528
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:02,109
if changing your password for your SSH
keys a PGP keys actually

529
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:05,908
leads to key revocation then

530
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:10,000
that gets you some love the way there
that is one way

531
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,500
she'd get encryption password just gene
to behave a little bit like

532
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,129
authentication past which you

533
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:21,250
good

534
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,469
that higher number is where yours are
you alter

535
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:29,408
had they don't know East your

536
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:33,000
but hell knowing I'll you know your your

537
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,109
year ironsides asks

538
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:39,230
sorrow fast eights

539
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,190
only where I'll you change your password
they are never promised

540
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,309
as our using exact yells

541
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:50,730
that you get there your yes

542
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,569
year you you have trust that one party
is

543
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,960
not are ones

544
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,520
bright hard 100

545
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,089
cast the net your is he okay but

546
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,578
ok yeah it can be done in such a way
where you don't have to

547
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,940
you know that is I'm if you're using

548
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,119
the right kinda protocols to that effect
cater

549
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,549
with a never have the option to state

550
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:23,829
to to wat che see your plaintext
password

551
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:27,700
she then you can use the same password
for authentication

552
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,710
and encryption search for yeah I mean I
assume I'll

553
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,109
you know and and we know that they're
actually planning system should do

554
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:38,410
behave this way we Group Inc like are

555
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,500
your you his

556
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,599
writer for birds
