I didn't bring my baseball box that's s

and oscars I'll pressure

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,099
he probably out brawl steps are I think
that's how you

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,109
site we will use deal with various and
by God's

15
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,460
hers thanks pare tired as he mentioned I
was here

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,050
last year to speak about passed through
I actually spoke about security

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:57,820
questions

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,109
and the password searching car some what
happens on

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,149
looking at some password database dobbs
that included security questions what

20
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,549
happened when people up to write her own
in

21
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,750
how to Sterling a pretty terrible thing
up by

22
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,450
first passer experience a las vegas was
actually in nineteen ninety 6

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,820
I was adept con 4 and

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,798
that was very early in my career I was
still learning a lot about information

25
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,479
security

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,829
and I decided on the desk on network
which was

27
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:28,919
mostly people bringing hubs and cables
and stringy things together

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,960
but I want to log in and check my email
while I was there

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,899
and I decided telnet the way to do this
there

30
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:41,469
I this is before the wall of sheep and
this is like I said I didn't have heard

31
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,520
quite the best grass pose what that
meant I do the toner

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,390
exposure password but here is my pink I
think it high-tech the wrong password

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,799
and

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,670
whites and then take my right password
and and won't get to the point where

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,960
they

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,270
they tried that once all be good I

37
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,950
as you might guess with them in about a
week's time

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,750
subtle uploaded Mike Helton what we at

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,130
cost much damage but that was an
important lesson for me in passwords and

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,910
password exposure to risk in

41
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,510
I something we're already talking a bit
more details about the day specifically

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,480
with Pastor expressions way to manage
that I'll

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
master very basic level especially if
you don't mind or

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,670
upcoming low where

45
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,280
may not be may not be super loud bizarre
what well

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,760
whatever will see better

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,280
I'll call

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,610
I'll just but the show and I'm not
recall any way specifically so you have

49
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,890
to worry about being embarrassed but

50
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,059
who here already has up what they
consider early

51
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,520
said opinion on password expiration
weather's good weather is bad weather

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,910
issues

53
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,570
all despite the recent past were head

54
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,299
alright so we're talking about that now
on see it by

55
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,480
expectations figures and vice versa good

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,660
so we pretty much all all-star kinda
basics here

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,070
go into specifically some studies on
passwords and password

58
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,880
I'll history but week-and-a-half

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,980
us starting kinda to topple we can
probably all agree

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,049
which is where if you have passwords
compromise and he's the change

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,550
password expiration kinda pushes into
the areas

62
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,770
up next two steps below which is look at
work on her social problem or

63
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,840
controversial which is

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,460
if you suspect could've been like you
know

65
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,790
think that something looks strange on
your calendar log in

66
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,170
or you I see some other sides that's
what the time change your password

67
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,000
probably not terribly controversial I'm
than 51

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,230
you know which has been you've used it
long enough it's then out there in the

69
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,010
world you

70
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,620
telemedicine from Def Con %uh you don't
know for sure that's been compromised a

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,520
chance but

72
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,740
up it's just that chance has there's an
app that chance

73
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,959
specialist that should be up a reason to
change in

74
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,510
I'm and thats again probably what your
we're here to talk about the day

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,179
sparking the more controversial those of
course there's one more

76
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,770
it's not on here which is Sep after what
you change it which case are looking at

77
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,860
a product architect

78
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,690
are or so how will you guys can see that
but I kinda try to outline

79
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,100
over the timer password up it differs
from password password system system

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,000
you coming up this time line %uh
exposure this time I to risk

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,070
that changes when it talks I wouldn't
know just by going through the regular

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,950
use to each user's gonna have

83
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,969
specific to their so I've got you know
the top example here which is

84
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,080
on this day I think July 1st user
selects a password

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,880
the right down the passer so they can
remember and then login for the first

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,539
time in the past

87
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:54,539
the next day same things were covered up
here but they logon password

88
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:59,360
day 3 a mistype their password there not
really paying attention just typing and

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,229
next on techno music box

90
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,169
you have this Leipheimer are different
exposures that can happen

91
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:09,849
that may or may not haha after the
compromise but definitely increase the

92
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,229
likelihood of that happening

93
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,580
I'm a course other passwords

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,090
I've got systems their for summer this
on where you go

95
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,380
any locking that are only have a couple
months early me suspicious activity user

96
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,430
not going coming from somewhere that's
an untrusted network not

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,880
writing a password our share it with
anybody so there's there's differences

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,840
when it comes to you

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,960
the passwords and regrets we face a lot
of times when it comes to pass

100
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,690
perspiration

101
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,290
will talk about we focus a lot of Pastor
crackles that threaten

102
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,620
at have tried to basically show here
passer packet of course

103
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,620
going to have to worry about I'm not
just for the easy ones to measure them

104
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,130
so there the question is if someone
knows

105
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,630
the concepts precious along got are over
overtime at

106
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,310
I'll and someone advice battered fries

107
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,860
person that are they can change your
password there's been a couple studies

108
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,120
on this once I guess

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,910
side versus I think this one of our
sponsors here they did a study last

110
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,150
got two years ago where they actually to
survey people

111
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,210
they asked him hey you were in a
situation where

112
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,130
I system you're using probably on the
Internet have been hacked

113
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,170
how long do you wait before changing
your password and so they survey what

114
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,820
people

115
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,060
know what their response work

116
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,669
like all good surveys notes have taken
with a grain of salt

117
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,180
going there sometimes think they're
going to do something that they really

118
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,660
wouldn't do it comes down to it

119
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,820
um but we also have data are were

120
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,879
how it really plays out

121
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,460
earlier this year university delaware I
as a response to partly

122
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,099
issue because they had supportable
servers decided that they would email

123
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:46,669
their

124
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,799
their students and staff say please
change primary network password I'll

125
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,020
after two weeks episode in the email
they had several thousand students and

126
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,109
staff to comply

127
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,610
out as you can see here they had about
57 percent up those are the student body

128
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,189
and staff

129
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,279
I'll out that had changed the passwords

130
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,180
and you know I would the pin it on you

131
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,480
you know the situation I might be about
my among that group either after that it

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,940
go out

133
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,810
all after at are clean came out last
there is something up

134
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,150
rest I'll but it does show can

135
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,120
sometimes people when polled do certain
thanks for what a

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,320
from a or anything here they're not
always going Quattro

137
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,560
on and finally Deba pics

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,110
reach the happen earlier this year where
they recruited

139
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,810
on hashed were however you wanna
interpret that

140
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,950
I'll security password database was was
reached

141
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,300
again customer or forced to change their
password they were

142
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,500
email at the registered email account
ass to change their password

143
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,630
I'll this is a little bit this is a
little bit

144
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,719
maybe CEO speak when it comes to what
this really means but essentially their

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
CES at CES about

146
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,460
nine weeks after the reach that 85
percent of their

147
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,039
buyers worst possible per for buyers
representing eighty-five percent of

148
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,380
their

149
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,070
volume up purchases had changed her
password so it's essentially the people

150
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,090
there are the most

151
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,940
making of purses people like me that
hardly ever get on e-bay

152
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,610
not a member so you kind of have a feel
for yes sometimes people

153
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,180
are gonna cooperate %uh specialists a
big hole that they

154
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,600
or password I'm compromiser is gonna
risk but

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,409
it's not a perfect solution just where

156
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,439
well okay three talk a little bit then
about the

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,250
the time what's how long and some

158
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,580
different Texas in areas do you have to
change your password

159
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,110
happen notice that there's a breach and
know that you need to change your

160
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,750
password

161
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,540
so you're a few those Obama the
anarchist

162
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,410
finest news source had an Lawrence that
with the Syrian electronic army last

163
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:54,900
year

164
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,500
where

165
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,940
a couple they're poised to pick up to a
phishing attack so

166
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,399
first day see electronic army people
sent out emails to several

167
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,230
I Stoppers to go to this website

168
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,630
and then once I got the website their
profit for the group allow credentials

169
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,450
only one person according to young
runway later when rose up which is how

170
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,450
we have this information

171
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,740
up but only one person responded that
because that

172
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,940
they are we getting that person's
account from the internal emails through

173
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,120
collapse the rebels

174
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,769
out or phishing emails look a little bit
more convincing came from your trusted

175
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,450
source

176
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,980
thought they were able to get further
hom

177
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,670
account compromise Never dates on here
not exactly sure 0

178
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,050
they didn't specifically they lot about
this it specifically

179
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,979
label what have been was but B&B
suggestion seems to be there was within

180
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,620
a very short time frame so maybe that
they may be the next day

181
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,220
up again somewhat still basically got
social media accounts because they had

182
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,910
access to the people's accounts from
there

183
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,360
and then even after the and his staff
had realize that there was a compromise

184
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,770
going on said out emails to people
saying

185
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,050
reset your password yes yea actually

186
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,310
forced to copy that message to send that
everybody but I T

187
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,069
and said yes reset your pass to go to
this link to do it and that was

188
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,910
a lot further continued access to the
social media capital

189
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,719
so it's a very short with a couple days
time frame up

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,470
there seems fairly on top up are getting
the credentials using the credentials

191
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,070
ask within the attack hmmm I'm another
example

192
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,339
is a couple years ago in 2012 South
Carolina are

193
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,410
right you

194
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,880
I'll was hit with an attack many written
up helped write some detail on that

195
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,360
again it started with a phishing attack
you

196
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,640
60 ways

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,490
credentials that they got about phishing
attack least one set they're able to use

198
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,430
to get into the internal network then

199
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,219
start looking around at work but it took
them around fifteen days according to

200
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,710
laws

201
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,410
records making many have access to up
with another couple days a storm or

202
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,219
passwords

203
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,230
and I'm follow up on day 20 they stole

204
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,209
probably be Active Directory password
database and then also following up

205
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,579
about that or stall

206
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,580
up and this is an important distinction
to kiss it and sometimes when you hear

207
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,110
about

208
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,440
of people protesting password expiration
they say well doesn't make sense to

209
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,500
hack password expiration because this is
a good and they're installed after all

210
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,640
it's not always possible

211
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,819
and that's that's a very valid point
some cases other cases

212
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,120
with no back course install

213
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,610
living there continued access is going
to have some valium

214
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,020
filing that worst-case scenario up this
was

215
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,460
a few years ago back me up is a list
technology

216
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,740
or the directors weather center where
how

217
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,250
password I guess in some sort news
article hacker was showing off that he

218
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,580
had these elite skills

219
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,640
and so he showed how you can log in to
this person's past up

220
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,240
disperses University Cal fairly the
reporter follow-up

221
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,340
the director and for it or yours

222
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,220
actors on hold on to it maybe lottery an
email

223
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,250
didn't go into details on on what was
actually happening in that time frame

224
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,460
but there was an active

225
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,570
no sport actor in that time other washy
color change your password

226
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,060
so different scenarios we try

227
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,459
many cases to try to you deal with all
those

228
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,210
using password: expirations as a primary
lines censor what I lost a pop bottles

229
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,440
and enjoy two goals which are published
with

230
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,700
with password cracking are skimp after
expiration

231
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,340
the first is that we want this to her
before the compromise happens

232
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,890
ideally now it's not always possible I'm
certainly passer det

233
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,290
worst passer expressions also step
almost spot

234
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,329
plants you wanna make sure detectors no
longer have access the passwords

235
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,740
I'm the secondary goal is also very
important

236
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,780
really going until a bit more detail
today on is you don't want new pastor to

237
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,750
be. so someone to the old one

238
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,820
but you really happen gain anything with
forcing people to change it that's a

239
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
little bit harder

240
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,900
especially to tour and force for bob

241
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,040
obscure is that going I'm as you guys
probably know most of these are

242
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,750
course through policies %uh within the
software

243
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,780
I'll news it's Sep or a certain time so
my days six months

244
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,839
there's occasionally very rarely alcee
systems at saying have a limited number

245
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,430
uses maybe a hundred loggins before you
change your password

246
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,479
something like that him there's also two
ways to implement it from a

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,640
how do you get people expired after
change their passwords you can either

248
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,350
give them

249
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,670
I what's called a grace login so like
Windows Active Directory

250
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,760
I ask expires I can still log in with
that password

251
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,460
sports immediately changed that's got a
grace login standpoint

252
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,970
I'm that tends to preserve usability
more because people are getting

253
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,060
pletely locked out they have that
opportunity to

254
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,680
lockable set the password of course that
also that there was a reason you wanted

255
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,380
them

256
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,140
did not log in with that password
anymore you kinda extended that streak

257
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,880
navigated asked you a couple with I'll

258
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,300
but of course the downside of the other
approach with lot not clear if they have

259
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,410
changed the password but

260
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,439
point you have to communicate that
upfront very well and you also have

261
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,740
people better not to do it and you could
have helped more help desk or

262
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,710
course of service up calls related to
them

263
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,900
typically because you entered is pastor
expression or some other

264
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,100
controls had to go along with them
password history is one of those

265
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,660
got how certain string

266
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,270
your forcing users I could make her
password when you pass at the same time

267
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,520
the system can do some checking between
those two

268
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,880
without storing the old one in history
somewhere haha but generally

269
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,020
your were serious about making sure
people are using passwords which we got

270
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,990
what would you

271
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,380
I'll you are going to be storing those
pastors

272
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,580
either usually hash I'll within your

273
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,900
account YouTube a summer and then when
they change their passwords your check

274
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,319
against

275
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,940
all your passion and passion what they
chose checkin gets all those other

276
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,060
previous results

277
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,130
to see you get there if they are indeed
using official

278
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,270
parties for sometimes will be eaten you
know

279
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,270
four times that has people will say
everywhere prevent the primary season

280
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,689
passes for year

281
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,440
yarn that we don't really care I it
really depends on

282
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,090
implementation made a pass rages another
while those you think

283
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,980
doesn't make a lot of sense onto you
realize that once password expiration

284
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,540
was introduced in past histories came
into play

285
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,599
now a few people probably not very many
ha looking for ways to get around that

286
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,120
and what they were doing was

287
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,130
sensually your password history was 10
passwords they will change a pass for

288
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,840
ten times to get back to what they had

289
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,520
head and push everything out the
password history stack and get back to

290
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,480
their original password

291
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,430
i guess i whether that was just the
technologically knowledgeable crowd was

292
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,800
doing I don't think that a lot of people
were but so this

293
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,010
such lists as you can said a day have to
wait a day before

294
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,450
person can change your password and
again some people criticize that from a

295
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,910
security standpoint same

296
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,990
I'll more something did happen in that
time frame it on change my password

297
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,510
on the day up they kept locks allow to
Cal

298
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,330
problem are very likely scenario but it
could happen i'm following the change

299
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,450
notifications

300
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,050
this is the idea behind this

301
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,120
is to give users a chance to New

302
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,850
say I'm gonna change my password resting
in with me within this window with his

303
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,800
notification

304
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,810
so first two weeks of the week they're
going to have the opportunity to say

305
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,579
you know why don't we talk more in
person thing to change my password a

306
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,820
particular but today

307
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,680
and all the other way want to worry
about especially when you have yeah

308
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,660
account lockout

309
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,850
the reach the passer expiration date
this becomes very important and missed

310
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,470
%uh the nest witnessed password measure
doctors will talk about here are a few

311
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,970
minutes

312
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,700
also really strongly recommends this but
the idea that people some people have

313
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,230
recommended

314
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,590
have suggested that this notification
his people time to like him

315
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,900
start this creative process coming up
with new pass routes are not sure really

316
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,770
takes that

317
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,449
airing it means that with something you
start think about it had a ball over for

318
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,290
a long time

319
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,680
very much happens within a few minutes
orange what republicans

320
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,730
change so where do some the guidelines

321
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,630
up what are some other popular sources
are

322
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,650
its I'll say we should & Poor's

323
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,770
password exploration and wall wasn't the
first it was

324
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,230
want to better document one certainly
became one of the earliest ones

325
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,480
which was the US Department the
defense's a password management guide

326
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,110
which is

327
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,899
the Green Line Green Book rainbow
serious I'll

328
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,500
they essentially established first all
guests should change password

329
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,980
or they are covered by before the
probability compromise

330
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,100
and they also have established the idea
up working

331
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,909
out a maximum lifetime and they actually
say

332
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,460
hey one here is probably sufficient most
cases for us to think you know

333
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,090
paid thirty days or so ninety days
whatever it seems like that's a big

334
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,659
change

335
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,380
up but also the time course 1985 service
came out

336
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,020
has a very different bacterial out back
to look at the appendix whether

337
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,920
calculating

338
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,640
how strong the password should be at how
long like touching me

339
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,500
they're making calculations based on the
number possibilities course it'll still

340
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,450
something you today

341
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,980
if you have your password a case lower
case numbers and symbols

342
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,530
I'm having probabilities you have to
guess before you get to that

343
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,050
complete set but they were doing it
figurine 8300 bartel 1205 moto

344
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,240
which gives you about 8.50 14

345
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,380
yes is permitted very different from the
$10 billion

346
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,740
yes as per second we can get now paper
after a timeout after cracking post

347
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,370
online

348
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,699
after yes you know how r hospitals past
tomorrow

349
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,290
so that established the baseline up but

350
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,670
we've had other organizations that apart
picked up on the idea password aging in

351
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,450
Denver on their own two sons on

352
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,510
on how should be done all I don't wanna
exhaustively or these were gonna touch

353
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,450
on some highlights

354
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,580
up somewhat more popular what's I
Windows 2000 what isn't.

355
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,649
or had password expiration date but
there was nobody thought you said

356
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,290
essentially what got me one

357
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,810
when you enable that policy up to 1000
the same way it was off by default by

358
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,060
default it for two days once you turn it
on

359
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,200
unless you choose to change it and they
had a little bit if fractured

360
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,230
I'll it back on in you way that they
suggested what what was

361
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,880
just time for that you know what source
you looked out

362
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,490
I'll worker papers and of course the
default scored two

363
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,550
other said you know hey you good with 19
here

364
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,570
high-security 183 Lal some 670 so

365
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,000
wasn't I i'm so I'm sure since then
they've kinda mom

366
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,840
got a little bit better about

367
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,980
data ice but

368
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,370
that was a big question especially
organizations and corporate apartments

369
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,659
looting password expiration

370
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,460
made it very easy he gets up on work
with some Bros items

371
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,570
couple others the PCI Council for people
who deal with

372
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,250
a bank cards major brands I'll

373
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,140
not the users themselves so I am a lot
by lot details

374
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,870
are I I'll change my password a ninety
days the people

375
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,949
man's are supposed to and in certain
cases depend on what type

376
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,380
I'll structure they fit into the PCI
standards

377
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,120
sands also had a nurse critical security
controls

378
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,590
the artist I'll yup a since they are

379
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,330
they say at least 90 days but the to say
something down at the bottom

380
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,919
which connects what we saw with the
other the

381
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,160
up green but passable I love watching
you should still

382
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,700
customize this baseball

383
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,720
your specific organizations violence
ninety-day should be we start with if

384
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,850
you have the manpower

385
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,030
knowledge to special say hey we don't
ninety days two of her

386
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,950
not often up obvious about it has a mile
from errands to be

387
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,880
in compliance with this control him

388
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,410
hello which is a healthcare regulation
United States on deal with records among

389
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,770
update exchanges ob in the actual

390
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,520
law but nothing about sorry about
password but i mean ruling

391
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,590
what the guidance documents the our
health and human services

392
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,909
gold him

393
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,910
hack muscles him

394
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,970
screw them they can kinda see a

395
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,150
nothing specific they don't say ninety
days we'll see her eight days but they

396
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,030
do say that should happen on a periodic
basis

397
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,639
I'll that's something they're expecting
those organizations that her

398
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,640
required to comply with a bud to to
emporium

399
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:43,020
problem

400
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,370
him

401
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,530
right OS kinda but no yet a

402
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,430
Apple you're up there with their
organization that focuses on what

403
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,640
application security

404
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,270
I'll they do have a document which is

405
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,530
intended for developers and the people
were are

406
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,670
assessing web applications primarily
body and application work

407
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,450
that they should have it up up
capability with any

408
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,950
proctor software to verify the password
passwords conspire

409
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,670
research about Hao out there are against
Pacific

410
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,110
they all say that has to be ninety days
but they do say that that functionality

411
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,550
should be

412
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,129
available on application to be here's
the website which is a week he so

413
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,430
anybody can really go at it

414
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,640
but says you know of course broad
agreement that this is important

415
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,720
I'll he disagreed that you want to go
change in my tum

416
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,570
advice easy organization which but

417
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,139
deals with banking regulation United
States and they have it. examiners have

418
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,390
a

419
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,409
which is then used by their sisters
you'll see

420
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,970
state regulators in people like that but
you can kinda see to it that kinda gone

421
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,770
through these arrange them so they get
from

422
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,030
very specific guidance to you Cardinals
well you should do this but it's not

423
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,870
necessarily

424
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,909
specific on how you should lol

425
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,620
up they just basically say he should
implement a schedule to change a lot on

426
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,350
AIM

427
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,129
set schedule im

428
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,210
this stuff document they mentioned
earlier

429
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,960
I'll the standard they basically said on
how trashy organizations to manage

430
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
passwords

431
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,840
and in the day to have a very good
ballast

432
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,300
approach this which is that you need to
decide whether that's

433
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,300
important for you but they also have say
something is very important I

434
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,590
that I don't see a lot of organizations
i've assessed done work with

435
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,330
which is having separate password
policies depending on what type of

436
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,960
application you're trying to implement
that policy applied only seeing

437
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,190
as Wong Harper information security
policies

438
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,160
ninety-day says 180 days of it doesn't
say hey for the system that you hardly

439
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,960
ever log into which is always over

440
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,930
HTTPS little you know it's an internal
system will test this policy is

441
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,820
different from

442
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,820
I your primary domain login or something
like that course

443
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,820
a the ISO 17 some 99 the old policy

444
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,460
they stop the BS 7799 on I have this in

445
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,550
miller won your sure you sweetness the
current

446
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,550
up all CSG the language is changeable
Obama

447
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,129
first two sections it really apply it to
pass respiration

448
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,850
one is that the upper section which is
that they say you should be told

449
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,669
change passwords at regular intervals
and the other one is the

450
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,750
the password management system should
enforce proper changes

451
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,970
if we look at the upgraded version that
replacement version possible to

452
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,300
for small they removed the language up
from

453
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,090
section the previously told users they
should be changed the passwords

454
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,780
regularly

455
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,960
and they also added the words as needed
at the into that system so to me thats

456
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,830
lighting up the language a little bit
make it a little bit more susceptible

457
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,300
lot to implement not

458
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,210
course organizations Templar password
aging if they want to comply with

459
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,840
the standard him there several others

460
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,360
up you know the IRS has one for port
sells them for state agencies

461
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,570
process taxes there's one for energy
regulation

462
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,879
Bob anybody from me with couple

463
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,040
you use it I know what it called at
specific guidance on what passwords

464
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,490
expiration should be I didn't get a copy
of that be the only other one that

465
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,430
people from getting for socks on its
things I'm not sure that has specific

466
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,430
guidance on it but

467
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,440
I was not just the standards that were
kind of buying into the idea password

468
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,170
expiration but there was a paper

469
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,410
%uh they also spend use asserts cured
behaviors back in 2004 which surveyed

470
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,590
grad students and such in I T and asking
them to rate different behaviors

471
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,419
everything from

472
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,730
installing Trojan on my on my computer
to

473
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,390
obsolete Michael lot of time on a
walkway from our

474
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,840
up but when I looked when they have a
with a stable didn't change a password

475
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,280
for two years just

476
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,420
not that was all the context they got a
personal them so that was my

477
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,380
misstating of the other 20 percent
either didn't agree yet rated

478
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,150
you know not a mistake her or something
else so it's kind of interesting how

479
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,870
%uh you know we and I'm gonna go to a
bit more how we could have had different

480
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,760
perspectives on

481
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,850
whether this is a good control what this
is about actual them

482
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,790
one on the challenges we have

483
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,180
with Pastor exploration what's wrong
with other things with an information

484
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,060
security

485
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,500
is that we don't have a really the data
we need to make some good decisions

486
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,350
about

487
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,040
on how effective this is control ideally
we want to know

488
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,990
how often has this pastor policy forced
a pass for change which they need to

489
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,840
prevent an attack from happening

490
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,889
or limit the amount of time that an
attacker

491
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,820
had access to to get into the system so
we look at this from a pin diagram

492
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,649
perspective I'll

493
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,020
the time where the pastor ballot

494
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,220
personal time for attacker at all in the
password but

495
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,840
also has the motive access skills if you
look at the SCRAM all

496
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,659
to to actually use that password what we

497
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,350
probably hope is that there's very
little overlap with that

498
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,740
that those pastor expirations working
great a password to gain cycled out fast

499
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,280
enough that we're not having much damage

500
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,190
reality is probably more like this but
we don't know for sure I mean we don't

501
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,710
have data that says

502
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,700
we have no way to judge the
effectiveness of control so it's

503
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,310
its anecdotes guessing it's looking at
what little data we have

504
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,409
you know this success a phishing attack
some things I'm to try to mix

505
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,230
make sense whether this is how Coronado

506
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,820
so what is the average person people
working in his policies to protect

507
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,240
think about changing passwords kinda
funny how to split

508
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,280
I'll one study from Jean rain

509
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,139
said that basically 38 percent would
rather do some household chore

510
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,090
scrub the toilets no claim up with our
that come up with a new user name and

511
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,830
password

512
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,100
common and just lost password but its
was

513
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,780
sorry I'm sure that that some share up

514
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,710
the other 38 per set think that if they
don't see a website

515
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,200
with password expiration that's a sign
that this website is not a secured

516
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,850
as the other website seem kinda got two
ends of the spectrum here the people

517
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,730
look at that as a as a ballot security
mechanism think they hope to see it

518
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,630
and people that would really not like to
change their passwords as long as

519
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,390
possible

520
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,760
I really liked this is so

521
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,350
something I found last year I thought
was a great example I love it he

522
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,699
way open nature or social me here where
you

523
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,900
Allstream thought so when I
confessionals about

524
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,070
their different security practices but
on a crowded

525
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,340
reflects how some people and then likely
majority people

526
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,649
have dealt with some types password
expiration which is not to take it as

527
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,730
even though they think it's hey we've
got to change passwords prolly purpose

528
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,530
key reason

529
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,500
they're not looking at that second goal
of making sure the past with and

530
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,180
choosing

531
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,490
is different enough from there a
password Obama

532
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,870
so I captured several those people

533
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,929
reflections are their own weighing going
about changing passwords what their

534
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,000
thoughts well

535
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,430
well

536
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,550
carrying or pilots in

537
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,620
that's true they they may have they

538
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,429
they may buy into it is not what
actually experience that for

539
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,340
that work themselves that notice here
the to the CEO issue will come back to

540
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,360
that you're a little while

541
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,419
so I kind of you over the years I've
seen a few things here and there about

542
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,100
people

543
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,260
headed protesting password exploration
and what their thoughts were on it

544
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,410
I want to cut it back tracked through
the years you back to the

545
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,910
last 20-30 years up up modern

546
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,870
you know implementations the passwords
and look at when people start objecting

547
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,040
to pass for expression that shouldn't
take me

548
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,129
very long starting back beginning up

549
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,200
even before the or I'm going okay I'll

550
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,610
and Unix System Operator copper systems
three-book

551
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,060
um for granted Robert more senior

552
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,399
were already cut it picking at at least
the implementation of

553
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,580
the password expiration mechanism had on
the system's

554
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,110
and there were some very specific
complains about the way the UNIX was

555
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,540
among those not so much

556
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,990
on applicable to every implementation
but the deficit concerns about just how

557
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,560
you score was a whole

558
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:37,010
I'm for cholera problem Sandia National
Labs also kinda I'll

559
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,660
from the anti-virus community I'll had

560
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,540
summer thoughts 1997 where he looked at
I'll

561
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,300
there wasn't much value being provided
by these past their expiration policies

562
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,050
that we were

563
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,919
we were implementing them we were put in
place but there wasn't much kayapo

564
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,150
her do it now kept looking

565
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,710
follow us different support ob I'm not
gonna go through each one of these

566
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,630
little on this year the same sentiments

567
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,020
either pass for the problem password
expiration was was happy to frequently

568
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,430
it was causing in convincing used quite
what they were getting frustrated with

569
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,710
while providing very little value people
were choosing

570
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:18,160
easily guest password is a replacement
people writing down their passwords

571
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,170
problem see if there's any specific

572
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,340
I think gene Spafford is probably one of
the first

573
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,990
great detail

574
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,990
I'll

575
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,670
have a step in your order problem after
expiration but if it was very

576
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,180
interesting

577
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,240
that's was Gartner Gartner here

578
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,780
course very big business some parts the
business community as far as their

579
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,870
their knowledge and wisdom but they had
written back in 2005 there a las que

580
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,330
practices were different from

581
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,330
more effective more valuable and what
passed for Asian back I think they

582
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,379
to make a statement somewhat to the
effect up there's a point nine

583
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,040
probability that

584
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,190
password aging not on providing out
that's what we believe that's

585
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,830
had sought basis in reality um that was
saying all of them

586
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,949
about sale some more resources here
coming up into a tour to the more recent

587
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,780
years

588
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,620
but despite all this a lot of it lot of
what they were saying with interlocking

589
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:13,959
who are

590
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,520
was bought some cases where they were
anecdotes I'm seeing people write down

591
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,920
we just think many numbers are

592
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,230
and drive seen this on I I don't believe
this which was great

593
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,780
on but it wasn't leaving till 2010
wearing

594
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,570
%uh some at some researchers at the
University North Carolina

595
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,409
were actually able to get a hold of data
and that looked at

596
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,450
what real choices were people making it

597
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,040
wrist it looking at past their
expiration look at that the passage

598
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,490
choices

599
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,170
they've had in the past this was
actually really interesting um

600
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,380
chance state they looked at just able to
cast their environment so probably most

601
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,250
likely students

602
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,440
at this university up that have passed
for history table I think that

603
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,180
pass because you do get up to fifteen
for some accounts a majority to pass was

604
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,800
a hax

605
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,000
the accounts they had access to only had
more 26

606
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,390
passwords stored but that still a pretty
good deal right is a look into

607
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,000
at the University of change password
every three months and they did have

608
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,880
some basic password complexity

609
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,110
i'm forced for people change their
passwords

610
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,240
so what are they fight they the personal
had a crack passwords which stop

611
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,500
that some that does have some

612
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,930
caveats to it because they're only
allies in the past to take a crap

613
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,960
course the more stronger passwords might
skew the results in a more positive way

614
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
they were able to analyze as many of
those but they did a fairly good job

615
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,939
cracking work we have I'll then they
took those menus transformer

616
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,020
they still basically regular expressions
%uh

617
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,510
to say okay we have a better passer
third wheel

618
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,350
password login password x-mas on
Facebook last resort support

619
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,080
how are things related can we do

620
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,250
I can create these transforms doing
simple things like

621
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,630
substituting a 1-for-2 and find a new
password value

622
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,670
and they found that are coming up with
all sorts around

623
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,910
what it's looking less at 5:30
transforms

624
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,810
everything from substitute numbers in
certain things deletes the translations

625
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,960
much what you see a lot of password
cracking filters these days I'm that

626
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,880
forty-one percent of the new passwords
that they had access to computer working

627
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,190
%uh fairly easily like I said 550 guests

628
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,400
says a millions and millions a different
cracking temps

629
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,010
just knowing what your password was and
maybe a more practical

630
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,470
missiles taste what are they said this
about three seconds you know

631
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,159
while crocodile sect worker cal but you
doing online

632
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,210
guessing hoster guessing have someone's
previously kept

633
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,470
Pieris previous password by his most
popular substitution switchable you all

634
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,000
were

635
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,810
number increment game number and
committing there'll

636
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,170
still get seventy percent up passwords
I'm crossing housing

637
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,470
so that was pretty important the part 1
the problems this paper

638
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,899
or 10 my my personal problems paper was

639
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,350
I you have what the Greek symbols into
had lots of tables observed a day had

640
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:06,920
lotsa

641
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,210
I'll information which was not easily
digestible by the

642
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,710
by the average I T practitioner so while
they did have some reason things like

643
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,270
this

644
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,860
radical actual paper was your way label

645
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,710
yeah hearst so who that the my one
critique the paper but was graded

646
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,089
Facebook sure

647
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,009
so I have a little bit dated reputable
sure out some also passwords that I

648
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,010
work that went to different environments
on

649
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,750
I unfortunately haven't got quite the
part I have as much detail as what they

650
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,339
had a plea

651
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:40,440
the US the case study but I'm working
towards %uh going

652
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,329
I'm there's one environment where I was
able to go back three times

653
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:47,630
over a three-year period actually on the
same month every year

654
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,680
struck the pastors crack the passwords I
sing about this being an Active

655
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,020
Directory environment was

656
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,280
up the headland hashes enable and
Tijuana

657
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,560
you can such a crappy ninety-nine
percent herbs haberson passers

658
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,950
I don't have a choice 15 characters a
longer you don't get those the premature

659
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,919
thing else you gonna get

660
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,920
so I wasn't a crack short with you

661
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,650
greater access to

662
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:16,119
there the pass which prepares there was
any passer expression at all

663
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,060
people were some sleep lot you past long
what your

664
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,549
how they run into a problem require
password change and the men believe it

665
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,720
or not the formidable blink

666
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,549
was three which that we live but I'll

667
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:34,410
about what their policy on so over the
three-year period looking at Cal State

668
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,129
were there for all three years

669
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:40,340
I try to look at how often people change
their password some critics

670
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,500
cut some some pictures here route 83 me
I E 183 percent

671
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,690
I'll can change a password I think it
was seventy-seven percent over the

672
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,300
three-year period for other 1000 some

673
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,119
a counselor they're all three years so

674
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,340
you are not terribly surprising people
aren't changing passwords must have a

675
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,210
reason to

676
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,849
all I did look at hotels they had at
least two different passwords and

677
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,970
courses are snapshots a tired-looking
the past year history

678
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,779
I was only able to tell they had your
password from previous time the name

679
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,990
change to 10 times

680
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,660
and that years period but horse that's
fairly likely

681
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,180
also kassebaum history for passwords
there was one for something as basic as

682
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,220
you voluntarily or for some reason how
to change the password

683
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,290
I'm this is also crashing I'll

684
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,210
the difference between the UNC study
this was for those people to change

685
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,280
their passwords

686
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,710
it may have been more difficult for them
to you shoots up in summer the pre is

687
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,210
pastor depend on the reason for the
password change

688
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,880
if they had for proper possible together
course that with one reason for changing

689
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,530
that would have been the way for them to

690
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,500
Bob go back then and you something
similar haas et

691
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,560
are but a later time and change the
third time I'll

692
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,020
so there might have been more that's
something I wish seen scars

693
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,720
how people all impact that house I'll
come back for

694
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,759
zulu but amenities tengo here this is

695
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,660
a slightly different into the spectrum
where is an organization where that

696
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,200
change password every 30 days

697
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,770
obverse similar in that they didn't have
a password complexity turned on

698
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,359
they did have a longer minimum length
six characters on but otherwise

699
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,759
inaccurate eurocrats all house

700
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,900
I'll that that they have but I didn't
get

701
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,299
how about 10 million up several samples
over time to compare a question

702
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:36,740
so we start looking at how to peddling

703
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,770
compares I got all three years as you
look here but effectively there

704
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,900
third some r2.0 I'm you can see a couple
inch

705
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,450
testing things first ball that wall the
minimum length

706
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,359
I'll he was three characters majority
people still tended to choose even

707
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,470
though they weren't being required to
buy software

708
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,700
in the ditches longer passwords cool

709
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,160
home with tango

710
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,620
twenty percent of the user's chose that
minimal up six characters

711
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,500
and then it was up to close to forty
percent what and about 35 percent

712
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,140
and before chocolate drop down I'm once
you get nine characters

713
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,980
doing it to that tends to say that if
someone's gonna happen committing to you

714
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,290
regular passer changes in our up with
some nice long Jersey

715
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,759
password you can say okay what's what's
the minimum I have to produce here

716
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,260
let's get that done and go from there

717
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,050
but it is interesting you'd have thought
%uh was notable

718
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,820
not really specific after expiration but
that these people

719
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,770
who didn't have that same pressure they
could have chosen 34 character passwords

720
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,890
there's still time did not choose hello

721
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,549
6&7 character aping most popular im

722
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,930
on password mask

723
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,839
comparison if you're familiar game with
Pastor cracking this is

724
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,170
essentially just a way of simple fine
saying okay

725
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,910
you know that's sexually me care about
whether to dictionary word name or

726
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,690
something but

727
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,560
let's just focus on the format it first
and so these masks rutler

728
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,920
represent all letters I specific letter
or specific number

729
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,040
how that passes or so this is all lower
case letters

730
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,740
this is 3% lower case letters all but
three numbers so also

731
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,790
or sea to sea from the thirty-year zulu

732
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,940
on the 30-year tengo the differences in
the masks and then this also tells what

733
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,430
percent of the total passwords

734
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,190
those were so the first big difference
you know

735
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,210
is it course people or use a lot more
just just

736
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,060
letters lowercase letters well as you
look burma and when you look at tango

737
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,270
selling out letters are being appended
on 75 percent those pastors

738
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,320
it's using the vertical format of
something letters plus

739
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,820
one number plus two numbers ob why don't
have a lot of details on it

740
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,400
IQ containing from just look at the data
up there was a lot of those that were

741
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,850
words followed by members

742
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,759
in so one hand it's good that

743
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,790
some he's probably were dictionary are
RR dictionary words

744
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:13,490
but we're not necessarily by as much
much else what we are actually looking

745
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:13,919
at

746
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,430
I'll yes you have that number of the end
but members themselves

747
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,669
are predictable to this is a little bit
busy as far as a bar graph

748
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,880
goes but you can kinda see this is all
three years as ILU

749
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,200
or just when your tango this is up the
numbers

750
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,509
those for use in those environments what
the preference was for certain specific

751
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,170
numbers

752
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,040
so who most popular number 10

753
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,110
zulu

754
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,580
was popular number one XR Louis

755
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:47,650
wanna all %uh 0 is tango you can also go
to see how r

756
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:53,120
for example a month that I took the
tango sample was in July

757
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,520
so seven

758
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,530
has a very high

759
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,430
um popularity for as the year

760
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,089
also very popular so even choices like
that

761
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,140
her attacker I'll especially if they're

762
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,420
this is a place at thirty days it's very
easy to guess

763
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,600
numbers probably get social with the
current month for it with the past month

764
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,259
have been on

765
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,290
what point new password expiration their
I'll

766
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,720
what's not what I really random as you
can see in the other environment

767
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,890
their chance to look at more home

768
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,129
problem a little bit more question as to
what slumping

769
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,960
home him

770
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,000
so I wanna feel more day don't know how
to use them I'm not following through

771
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,310
with

772
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:44,310
my Marissa I'll I'll which are the more
secure which will be secure those two

773
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,310
environment site

774
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,279
you know I can set up a that's my
suspicion is that there's not mean a lot

775
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,690
of my pastor expiration

776
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,590
I did like this quote from Gartner up
back in 2010

777
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,480
other papers about

778
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,640
that risk a what's motivating having
passed Exploration Place

779
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,589
ads this is the nicest version

780
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,850
and this is the rap version also from
Gartner this is from their BP

781
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,190
other security practice I'll but there's
a lovely place

782
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,560
auditors which I think to extend spare
because they're the ones that are

783
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,900
they're having to enforce the standards
that are on the books or the standards

784
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,540
that we were in our policies

785
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,700
but the reality is you know they can
only take so much to blame

786
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,430
on we have responsibly ask yet he scary
people to

787
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,529
of make sure that were not

788
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,410
sole risk averse were saying what we try
to pass for x-rays for

789
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,560
to pass for exploration on someone could
get this person's password and use it

790
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,150
for

791
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,410
six months user per year ob home

792
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,620
we have to be willing to accept some
that risk wouldn't make sense

793
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:55,089
not in every case it's also very easy if
you've inherited if you work internal IT

794
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,150
you've inherited policies or practices
hang on

795
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,490
ten years ago or fifteen years ago or
just a lot though stay on the books the

796
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,350
way that they are today

797
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,100
unless there's something pain point is
now a motivation to go try to fight

798
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,680
those battles

799
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,759
you can change going to be our community
is going through I

800
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,230
extra articles and comments like yours
like that as a as an issue every time

801
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,080
home and try to fight those battles why
do you think is interesting and what

802
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:19,830
some of those

803
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,830
some the objections like up but who are
also

804
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,319
his paper that won the area's passer
excretion can make sense isn't shared

805
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,660
password environments where

806
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,759
you have five people with these service
passive they have to share for some

807
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,300
reason may not be a great practice

808
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,500
but they have to do it having passed for
expression that place because diffuse

809
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,170
responsibility among those people

810
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,910
can actually have some benefits
especially in smaller environments where

811
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,040
they don't have a real

812
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,200
reach its ok doubt say do a risk
assessment

813
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,589
house restoration having that turned on
purses nothing

814
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,670
can help to put some pants so

815
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:00,340
again it's it's nice I pat dry cases get
rid a passer inspiration it's worth

816
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,920
make sure it's been used in the right
situations double

817
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,160
that makes sense so has there been a
shift to me like I said there's more

818
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,230
attention being given the past for
inspiration for people who are in our

819
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,060
writing are and a this is I don't a
great passer expirations great

820
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,170
on the certainly been a member
organizations here sample

821
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,430
your what's interesting is sometimes
password expiration

822
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,460
all season tied to other half for policy
changes

823
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,710
such as in case at Northern Illinois
University where they said

824
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,500
way to increase operational passwords
were also increase in a while

825
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,890
up stand for change their password
policy earlier this year saying

826
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,520
also increase in a blink but you'll not
have to use many complex characters

827
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,210
so people packed tightly into that also
thought universe is ever easy

828
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,560
to witness this happen because they
typically have published policies for

829
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,759
accessible on the Internet sometimes
they have bolton's there soon after

830
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,040
their

831
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,830
students and teachers hard but it is
interesting to see the even

832
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,290
US defense finance and Accounting
Service I'll

833
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,210
announced they're also increasing
liberation how long possible

834
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,410
forum if you're over the whole issue
story

835
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,670
obvious you had a I did a pass for to
Oklahoma State University had a

836
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,250
ninety after expiration I do why but
I'll

837
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,410
they were a lot of hatred for special
Twitter what kinda funny was this guy

838
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,870
pop criminal or

839
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:27,009
support partner had agreed something
some number years ago to put his name

840
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,920
on the past year expiration notice is
that we're held out to the students and

841
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,690
teachers so

842
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,210
he apparently was getting a a good deal
of pain weather was

843
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,350
serious or not I'll and this was earlier
January this year

844
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,150
just last month OSU announced that they
are changed her password expiration

845
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,640
from 90 to 180 days so which leads me to
believe that

846
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,629
even though again it's not necessarily

847
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,970
maturing of exploration make it to your
whatever

848
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,490
that given attention just bringing to
the forefront so why do we have this

849
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,160
policy

850
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,890
it doesn't make sense to have rested his
case because he was getting

851
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,240
taking a potential on that that
sometimes can stimulate

852
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,859
discussions about chain after Paul's so
what are your alternatives if you decide

853
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,460
okay

854
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,880
Bruce I'm ready to loosen up or password
expiration it all together

855
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,460
what my gonna tell alters your right to
my boss when I tell other people

856
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,310
when it comes to I'll what are
alternatives are

857
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,580
what else are we doing to try to stop
pass a compromise from

858
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,230
having big problems are course the
easiest what is the only force

859
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,520
changes when compromise the suspected 40
change password policy

860
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,290
go from seven characters a character's
people are gonna

861
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,120
before still got muster you actually
stimulated passage

862
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,609
up to one of the more popular ones i
think is this targeting a lot more

863
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,690
tension

864
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,700
is he intrusion prevention coupled with
behavioral profiling you use Norton

865
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,339
products in the market for years

866
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,170
they've seen a lot more idea about what
a patent this year the summer companies

867
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,870
out there parking is right now we're

868
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,250
especially for online services way you
move your mouse over

869
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,490
way you cook your application wat u
reaction stimuli

870
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:11,859
fairly within the normal navigational
the application

871
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,520
can be used profile you as a user
specially course coupled with

872
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,590
are you coming rusher joined China when
you gonna come from

873
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,120
%uh somewhere else those types of things
can King

874
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,400
I I'm complement the password and as

875
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,980
we have identified you on this is always
a good one to better feedback to users

876
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,160
you say your last blog post here or a

877
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,120
you ok pass rules changed these things
can help users in an intelligent way

878
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,319
give us feedback on whether something is
happening that should be happening

879
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,860
because someone's got my password

880
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,080
course this is easier said than done

881
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,140
but if you have a situation where you're
saying it was a wee wee

882
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,040
go change past every 30 days sixty days
because we just can't stand pass through

883
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,500
compromise happening gotta try to
prevent all cases

884
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,020
you funny looking for something more fun
factor like I said these are settled on

885
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,170
some systems make that very difficult to
implement them

886
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,340
I'll but it is certainly something that
you should be consider

887
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,510
whole out

888
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,270
I was gonna say to this and I'll

889
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,370
if you want to write a justification for
changing your password policy

890
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:23,049
Texas A&M I'm had 1i think a couple
years ago that's out there is a PDF

891
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,420
with the road up very well is low these
references makes

892
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,130
scales I don't have a link to it here
but if you let me know I'll certainly

893
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,260
send you a link to

894
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,280
PDF give you a starting place right
right right justification they actually

895
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,000
went up

896
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,590
password like that some other stuff too
password expiration was on par

897
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,080
home so areas where I'd like to see
research

898
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,650
I need a course because I'm always
interested in getting more data in some

899
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,030
the information traffic better

900
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,370
and smart decisions I'll like I said

901
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:55,460
we still house fairly limited offer what
the impacts or

902
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,650
I'll

903
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,690
can you educate you like catching my
past 60 days for one system

904
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,480
by pastors have nothing to riches reach
up there you'll die spur type system so

905
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,410
it's fairly easy

906
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,629
many public random hacer people random
passwords

907
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,990
up to use every time I have chains not
too difficult for me

908
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,939
rice noodles does that something is out
cold all users are you up who is

909
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,970
something that's going to be really
helping out certain

910
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,169
small portion appears base is there

911
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,970
an optimal time I get Sep 30 days
probably way to you all

912
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,779
what about a year make people change the
pastor here are they gonna move away

913
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,690
from that making predictable choices

914
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,030
little passerby related to the name
password we only have 280

915
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,600
object like a conventional what are the
impacts the worst

916
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,009
this is my

917
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,020
niece Niger I did for her

918
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,520
%uh recently was hard for her to change
her password and

919
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:54,119
here that's it

920

um I guess I hope but any I

921
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,840
tennis kinda but took a survey beginning
about

922
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,070
opinions of passage anybody's opinion
change the password expiration

923
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,840
new evidence you can use who at my
that's really my hope for the change

924
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,470
your mind or not

925
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,970
least you have some more information but
feel free to contact me I hope that

926
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,118
about the slides appear out as well as
links summer

927
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,640
sources I have with another is a lot
like cover too sparse

928
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,060
other differ who resources in here I'm
but

929
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,680
many questions for

930
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:34,160
sore him

931
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,359
hop are right yes

932
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:43,990
so where they were actually standing for
those strings

933
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,939
like and downs hit 10

934
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,340
okay hope higher

935
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,020
right to fly got his answer you Rd

936
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,100
yes I'll in

937
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,640
you're not that I've seen in the closest
thing that as a guest who hold tell you

938
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,549
if he'll try to log in with your old
password hey you change this ninety days

939
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,210
ago so they're keeping records about

940
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,460
and we'll do some basic alerting but
that's not really I D S type things

941
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,590
I don't think i've seen or her thank bay
this doing not local

942
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:20,050
up testing I think it vs Chennai to
trial here

943
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,240
her lack

944
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,689
the back to her

945
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,960
you know measure

946
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,790
is or here how all

947
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:39,020
all are shows

948
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,750
you yo or

949
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,330
well I you know I'm always by update
it's usually easier

950
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,400
out what I have seen states not really
specifically related that

951
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,560
is the black person a certain passwords
by organizations the course that they

952
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,049
up specially out what Sanchez online
games are certain to do that we're

953
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,359
home arena ArenaNet and up

954
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,350
I think a.m.

955
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,130
I kept the other game in with they're
they're basically saying listen we've

956
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:08,520
had

957
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,080
these million passwords that are
possibly China fight against our couches

958
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,369
can is anymore

959
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:17,400
often but yet not specifically to yet
that level with your

960
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,180
yeah I think side like him

961
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,770
him

962
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,550
she here bastards compile

963
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,920
odd there's a big difference between
changing authentication passwords and

964
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,420
encryption passwords

965
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:42,150
I am where in a sense you got one type a
password decryption passwords

966
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,760
did you should very rarely change she
and so

967
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,060
we sending people a signal

968
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,480
when we're telling them to change
passwords and then

969
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,690
we come across a case where

970
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,550
if people extend that advice

971
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,950
to those other passwords for actually
doing themselves a very big disservice

972
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,750
%um

973
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:12,060
gym are there any mother Negrete

974
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:17,130
worst-case I'll worst practices stories
that you have %uh password changes

975
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,990
mean when that kind occurs to me that I
should be clear a member is

976
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:26,140
assay that was checking to make sure
that your password was different enough

977
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,400
from one of your other ones which can
have indicated that it must be storing

978
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,320
you're all passwords in the clear right
yeah I

979
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,340
a and that's actually traffic where

980
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,360
im someone is you know I see a lot since
the part where you probably do i chart

981
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,690
capture screenshots

982
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,670
adjusting I all know what made you
change your password after being

983
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,970
database login or something

984
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:53,299
on seems like I did see one recently
where it was something like go

985
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,350
some was complaining that their password
was being compared to a previous

986
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:00,549
password and it was there wasn't a this
is the exact same thing at this is very

987
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,150
close

988
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:04,910
and that's my subsystem the course
argument with her personal impression 10

989
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:09,259
nothing at all well I could happen but
on the specific company the namer

990
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:14,200
product or something like that yep sale

991
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,589
are also so that a wreck stalking well
here love more about

992
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,880
him him

993
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,600
there's a website to dedicate it to

994
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,000
and recent Amy every sites which stall
speed express what is good

995
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,750
and ex-offenders like that come and if
you go there you see

996
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,590
hundreds or stories

997
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,010
right is very common textiles is a good
place to look it seems

998
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,950
either abort a site you find as even on
the plaintext passwords or

999
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:46,040
go see on the site you use house I

1000
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,400
sup cool but

1001
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,690
I'm him fundamental

1002
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,280
on he mentioned using dice where mmm

1003
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,700
and which read it to generate a master
password for

1004
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,290
1password and then refused at sense them

1005
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,540
to generate passwords richer very
happened quite strong

1006
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,020
him air quotes %um when

1007
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,380
where required to change passwords the

1008
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:21,390
are it strikes me as odd that it should
be up to us to decide if it's

1009
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,850
current enough for stronger or it

1010
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:28,069
its we're singing that risk and

1011
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:31,820
so that's one part of the question and
the other part is

1012
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,740
our financial institution I just
reminded him has never

1013
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,870
ever recorded us to change our passwords
out

1014
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:43,930
we have different Larkins yes very
interesting you'll see

1015
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:47,480
that's a that's a common thing all see
people complain about like pillsbury

1016
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,470
Ghatkopar stalker password my bank that
has or

1017
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:54,540
they're just very large inconsistencies
in how that supplement given

1018
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,940
week the cake tastes all too them

1019
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:05,930
thing a.m.

1020
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:09,040
yeah but here first point about password

1021
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,750
hearst pastor girls personal them

1022
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,800
are that's a very interesting think
think about like what are the very few

1023
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,920
security controls the

1024
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,460
people say a wall I had to come up with
it so therefore its body with your

1025
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,730
sister party to me

1026
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,940
I should have more control over I should
I choose I want to be like they wanna

1027
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,410
I and so in some systems I think that
certain excess special

1028
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:32,560
lower security stuff but I wasn't
monitors him

1029
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,830
one pass for generated him

1030
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,049
the site's not happy with contain
certain characters or

1031
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,790
him right there

1032
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:49,970
him right yup gem

1033
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:54,950
I've got just pure speculation about
what's going on with

1034
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:58,410
the week password requirements for banks

1035
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:03,190
I'm and I'd love for somebody to
actually have solid

1036
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,540
researching evidence on this arm

1037
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,579
I suspect that day

1038
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,959
are the day are encouraging week

1039
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:19,899
passwords because they want though their
passwords to be unique

1040
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,509
and not written down our stored in an
excel file

1041
00:58:23,509 --> 00:58:28,869
and that they believe that their hair
she is it never going to be compromised

1042
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:33,999
right so that so that they've put their
defense is to make sure that

1043
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:37,459
their hair shoes or whatever they're
using

1044
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:41,269
will never be exposed and so then

1045
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:44,848
they're actually lowering their password
requirements on people

1046
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:49,549
so that people will pick unique things
remember thinking once a comment on your

1047
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:53,538
here's statement them

1048
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:58,289
I hope so not that I've ever worked in
information security in a bank

1049
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:01,659
me through it I'm not a lawyer blah blah
blah

1050
00:59:01,659 --> 00:59:05,349
two things one compatibility with the

1051
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:08,630
back and heavy ir

1052
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:12,289
that some banks have had for years the
second thing

1053
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,319
customer comes first we need to make it
easy for them

1054
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:19,079
they need to be able to get into their
bank account we don't care if it's a

1055
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,140
best practice or not

1056
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,730
yeah i IIIi passionate

1057
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,710
also knows lying some systems require
reversal on crips NC have that as well

1058
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:34,220
and as far as where same but week
systems are you live on certain number

1059
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,939
passwords

1060
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,090
shirt number passes or this and that
stay so it definitely would not be that

1061
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:39,570
it would

1062
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,950
you know there's because you know you
wanna have increase a case base as much

1063
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,629
as possible

1064
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,000
you so when you leave the business unit

1065
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
making the decision which is usually
probably the head of marketing

1066
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,750
her business development what do you
think they're gonna decision ergonomic

1067
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:58,100
im yeah I think its some cases to

1068
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,400
they're just not there's not know that
the people that write the bank and

1069
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,220
software are

1070
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,328
in pressure the customer that issue for
all

1071

probably about six or seven different

1072
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:11,640
core banking

1073
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,839

infrastructure protection software

1074
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:15,700
vendors

1075
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,410
