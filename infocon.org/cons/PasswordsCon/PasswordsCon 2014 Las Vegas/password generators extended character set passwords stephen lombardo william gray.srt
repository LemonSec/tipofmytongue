1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,330
just told them and that you actually do
that no

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,220
get your own part is recalling backhoe
your how your risk okay

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,339
yeah it's month to do that yeah and
onion

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,440
bakery we call yourself by I hope a
hotel muscle

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,630
elected diet so of God yeah really drunk

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,169
yeah the great yeah i i'd like

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,090
I just feel like I i do where did he
share II so I have a number I'm

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,750
live in New York Madoka passwords I'm

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,370
I

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,500
0 Craig yeah of course that city's
desecrated ca

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,050
and I I go

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,968
alright alright thank you and thank you
sorry I wasn't trying to be a

13
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,230
rude remaining thank you but my name is
Billy Graham

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,569
I within the working day workers at
attic and I work on not strip the

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,359
password manager and I help out and seek
a safer

16
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,640
the open-source and kept a database that
is built on seek what

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,690
so last year I met pair at passwords 13
any hats and strong suggestions

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,060
over rather demands about how password
generator should work specifically pine

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,320
so it today I'm looking forward to
continuing that discussion

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,240
assert nearly every day we run into some
away post

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,829
like this authorization authority that a
wanted to create a new account

22
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,658
use your real name set a password to
that so we know what you write

23
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,329
I so what what kinda password you choose
our own

24
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,559
where the user password manager or the
same has hurt all the time just a moment

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,259
me know a mental investment here should
be random should

26
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,539
be saved and save for later I should
make up something new

27
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,789
use the same old thing and if you're
like so this year

28
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,739
iron of the many bus you might actually
wonder if you're even capable coming up

29
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,539
you know with a good truly random
password yourself I am so in that moment

30
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:57,469
you're trying to guess how your choice
disc rain will affect your future

31
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,500
on a beer job maybe something more
serious defects other people and i know

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,509
im trying to be funny but

33
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,409
you know this is kinda serious actually
you're setting a password on a an SSH

34
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,129
key or

35
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,729
report I mean your LinkedIn account
probably not too serious but pay

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,890
a some people who have linkedin so

37
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,328
you know they're always these
instructions on the screen no

38
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:16,890
news-review

39
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,160
usually hidden into you hit submit that
I tell you forget you forgot to use a

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,470
a special character in the special
character that you need to include is

41
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,579
one have maybe 45 special characters
they've been near a did not call the

42
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,680
ones that are available to you

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,840
and I we suspect that these limitations
actually have more to do with protecting

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,180
regular expression validation

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,829
then actually anything you pick
particular importance but

46
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,989
some there are often aren't that many
characters for us to choose from

47
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,579
I really we've got here and I'm we got
upper and lower case letters are no part

48
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,620
and punctuation in the basic Latin stat

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,260
the lower and you know Coach so there's
no name yet no Cydia known well

50
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,250
allowed why do we make these
requirements

51
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,310
I mostly we want to encourage people to
use random passwords work a little

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,349
better passwords

53
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,450
because they don't we don't on

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,869
with it we know that people don't use
good passwords me know sometimes we

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,280
don't use could pass rates we've seen
the research wish

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,599
in here at the conference the so maybe
you know maybe it's not working

57
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
a but I would like to call these common
restrictions

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,689
they constitute a policy that people now
default to so

59
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:28,578
we heard yesterday during julia Ann wins
excellent keynote she uses a five word

60
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,310
Password

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,010
for high HP on but then she capitalized
sweater and throws an exclamation point

62
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,828
because she has to

63
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,110
and my friends you know think that this
is the way to make their password safety

64
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,849
you know when I talk to Michael what
kinda password should I use you know

65
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,929
I use encyclopedia but a capital I
didn't didn't just 3 for any

66
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,230
put one on the end that's good right I N

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,858
so at you know as most you know these
text passwords to be really easy to

68
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,510
crack because the policy forces people
to patterns

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,640
patterns they can remember patterns that
we can guess and break with ASCAP

70
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,480
pretty easily and top that some sites to
protect your password very well at all

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,358
alright I microsoft recently recommended
in a research paper

72
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,329
people been discussing that we begin to
use easy to we begin to use

73
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,390
easy to remember throwaway passwords up
repeatedly for sites

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,810
we visit where our own security
requirements are perhaps a lower

75
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,890
where where we think the risk it being
stored in secure we and eventually

76
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,120
exposes a

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,960
is pretty good and I i think they have a
point but I'm not sure how to take that

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,419
they

79
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,479
I am and then other folks believe that a
that they

80
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,530
there you know the xkcd comic I

81
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,780
known as password strength that's that's
you have for them that's the end all

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,090
like that the end to the discussion

83
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,849
you take some random words just sticking
together you get it on a bench p

84
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,659
you know we we're gaining strength
against the password cracker for every

85
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,919
single character adding

86
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,070
I'm sorry this is very base well but I
just don't leave anybody behind you

87
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,590
so cracked or spatters table I am

88
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,250
I wonder how many people actually
employed a strategy I mean besides Julia

89
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,430
did anybody here actually use them if
you don't mind saying to use this

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,030
strategy

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,179
yet and emails yep who

92
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,580
interesting II don't I'm a hump little
easy

93
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,250
I but each extra letter does

94
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,190
work it does mean a lot for now and I
want but I wonder how long

95
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,060
it will matter it will always get I'm

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,440
Warren don't you i words beauty

97
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,610
to mind when we r yet

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,900
yeah that's good fantastic

99
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,190
army last one unity

100
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,729
I see discussions with him had been

101
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,490
just making and up

102
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,020
yet me yeah good

103
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,109
caller yeah I'm

104
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,500
yeah char

105
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,810
in

106
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,090
were just too which is experiencing
technical difficulties please bear with

107
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,929
us

108
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,430
cracked or spatters are did you guys see
the pad

109
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,030
anybody here went to passwords 13 last
year besides jet

110
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,250
and your did you guys catch that

111
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,660
I forget the name at the top there was a
house cat talk in which they were

112
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,400
specifically pursuing

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,758
past races I'm you know paid using their
pattern matching attacks to go after

114
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,460
that

115
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,799
on you know times can proceed because

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,330
but i wanna talk about that's what I
wanna talk bout so I so if we're a for

117
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,628
picking even for picking the word random
you know it there

118
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,990
there will come a point at which these
guys are going to get good at breaking

119
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,090
four randomly chosen words in the
English Dictionary in

120
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,030
basic Latin characters the

121
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,020
our understanding would have what is
difficult to is also a rapidly changing

122
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,219
so while you

123
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,340
well we may get it a lot more entropy
for every single character re add

124
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,109
yeah it feels like a a slight hearing
how you sliding I know it's

125
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,379
maybe a losing battle see I am

126
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,310
and then yeah like juliet many people
end up kind if she warning that the

127
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,919
technique so you capitalize a letter you
throw an exclamation point

128
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,318
or you can grand prize the strings a pic
fully randomize 'em

129
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,190
still picking which the dictionary but
again you happen to the past you can't

130
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,280
remember

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,659
or maybe you don't remember where that
was the always in the 3G change maybe

132
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,669
was a sea change days in 30's

133
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,508
AZ's hum so

134
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,830
we're not much better off than we were
before when it comes to the pattern

135
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,680
matching attacks

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,300
in the latter case and so I think that
means it's time

137
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,930
you know maybe in the xkcd comic they're
suggesting that you want something that

138
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,180
is

139
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,879
easy to remember in fact there's a
limitation at the bottom of it that I

140
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,580
wish I'd included in the screen

141
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,479
cap is something like for twenty years
we've been you know

142
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,210
teaching people to make passwords their
hard for them to remember

143
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,650
you know and that was the lamentation
and not you know what I don't want to

144
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,229
remember

145
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,930
them you know I want to get his keys I
want them to be truly random I don't

146
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,520
want to know

147
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,810
on except maybe in the case of logging
into top

148
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,020
and so there's always exceptions to
rules red

149
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,659
and so it

150
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,500
attackers are getting better and better
cracking ashes we've got a limited

151
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,139
character set to choose from for each
gain entry in each character added

152
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,189
so while adding another character your
password will always increase the work

153
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,979
factor required maybe we can do better
maybe we can expand the possible said

154
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,958
for each character the typical ASCII
said we were just looking at before is

155
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,828
just the lower end if you know code for
anybody

156
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,228
it doesn't know Unicorn is a massive
cellco points for the characters we

157
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,089
regular use

158
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,170
be referred to as ASCII but usually were
typing our computers

159
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,740
we're actually working with utf8 in web
browsers on Mac OS 10 needed for use as

160
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,780
UT F-sixteen

161
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,699
I am I've heard here in there that using
these type the characters

162
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,109
I from the restive unit code isn't going
to help

163
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,370
they won't prevent has cash from crack
your password I suppose that's true if

164
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,959
you're

165
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,390
using patterns but if we're talking
about truly random passwords

166
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,150
I think it's kinda ish ridiculous
suggestion that expanding the set

167
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,130
available password characters we choose
from

168
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,230
to create a password wouldn't give us
more entropy

169
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,730
I wouldn't give us just harder to crack
password so we decided to take a look at

170
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,890
some things here

171
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,050
the Q the complexity a for at set of
pins

172
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,770
039 you ever numeral set up ten there
how does that compare to our Latin set

173
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,569
which is about 95 to 100 characters

174
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,860
we can see that within

175
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,459
up it's six or seven can visit eight
characters bad eight or nine characters

176
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,619
with the more complex at we're getting
better

177
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,809
a more complexity than we do with 15 in
the inset

178
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:55,040
we know that but what about the 250,000
I characters new code it's actually

179
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,900
pretty much astronomical

180
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,089
within five characters we've definitely
done

181
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,860
the complex work 15 in the basic Latin
set

182
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,600
and now that sounds a dry I'm trying to
find the right way to put it

183
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,720
but we think it's time to try it out

184
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,980
so we built you know in a few days just
a password generator that distorts

185
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,420
cranking these things out leap because
we wanted to know what it would look

186
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,400
like

187
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,819
%uh actually selecting from the full
unicode said is a

188
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:26,199
is sort of a daunting pop proposition
their over a million code points I think

189
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,339
something like 1.14 million Co points in
Unicode

190
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,730
but they're not all utilized summer
actually the

191
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,799
immutable reserved a someone you know
where

192
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,089
the car spaces we're going to add
characters later so there are a lot of

193
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,170
points need a code set where there's
just

194
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,299
nothing just a fast-paced see you can't
just traverse you can't you know

195
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:50,490
go integer by integer up the set of
characters to pecan to select them out

196
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,309
so what we did here as we squeeze
elected out 55,000 characters from

197
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,929
various how its new code and that sort
of requires

198
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:03,760
well sort of paging through it looking
out for gaps

199
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,110
but so this isn't hard to do putting
this together

200
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,309
on

201
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,600
I think got yes oh yeah forgot I had the
sensor

202
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,010
this is simple piano okay her oh yeah
the URL

203
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,189
yeah I or give it out later but

204
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,750
passer blasters to sample out there were
gonna put I get habash and I basically

205
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,110
wanted to you

206
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,339
we wanted to see if people could use
this and start you know saving these

207
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,520
passwords me and making you see them

208
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,010
I'll but the that the next question

209
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,669
his arm is how useful is this

210
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:45,449
we serve a 25 popular web sites from
Model X a top 100 and personal favorites

211
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:47,939
and I would have liked if surveyed a
whole lot more maybe this is one of

212
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,490
those jobs Mechanical Turk

213
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,209
but I signing up repeatedly for accounts
and then going to the setup process over

214
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,510
and over and over again

215
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,319
takes a lot more time they might imagine
but we suspect to me these web sites

216
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,010
would not

217
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,370
accept these passwords and web sites
like Yahoo LinkedIn me

218
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,890
we we kinda figured this wouldn't work
maybe I but we're not sure yet to see

219
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,829
right

220
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:13,640
um we also and this was maybe a little
bit Navy thought that maybe if we force

221
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,490
these passwords to have

222
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,720
one basic Latin numeral one lower case
character one uppercase character when

223
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,640
medicare actor

224
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,709
if we included those basic requirements
that your bank america login wants to

225
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,329
have

226
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,640
the Navy would let you get away with
these unico characters

227
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,860
I am so the results are that

228
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,790
they did work in many other sites but

229
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,569
my notion was a little bit naive so 14
the 25 accepted them

230
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:46,250
that was a plot higher-than-expected um
but the odd thing was that

231
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,720
all those who were rejecting the unico
characters were rejecting even though

232
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,049
you met their requirements in terms of
having an uppercase a estar

233
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:56,699
whatever arm and

234
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,520
this was very surprising those accepting
unico it had almost no restrictions so

235
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,660
for instance reddit dot com

236
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,699
has password policy if one character you
just have to have what a password

237
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,349
I tried to put in 0 didn't work out but
nope nope that's right but

238
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,140
yet they will accept anything doesn't
matter and that that seem to be the case

239
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,630
across the board for every single say we
surveyed

240
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,770
anybody that let us use Unicode
characters didn't

241
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,790
care at all whether there is no upper
case and lower case new number and

242
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,280
Medicare didn't have any kind
restrictions at all

243
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,720
harm to I miss insides

244
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,750
awesome awesome this is Carl

245
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,130
it anyway that is basically how it
turned out we think this is gonna work

246
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,740
um but we think we have we actually have
to start using we have to actually

247
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
provide

248
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,880
pass for generators that provide these
categories provide the option for people

249
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,360
I think if you

250
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,610
give people the option and I think they
will start using it I'm sure chaos and

251
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,970
clammy is going into

252
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,839
and I would like to you know talk about
what you're saying before in terms your

253
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,240
experiences with people and their master
password

254
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,410
iron but I think if people start using
these things they start going to sites

255
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,640
where they can then a lot of states are
allowing them

256
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,240
they're gonna get used to it they're
going to like it and then your bank to

257
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,020
bank oven

258
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,020
when they go to Bank of America dot com
and it doesn't work

259
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,270
they're gonna email people email right

260
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,510
here you have customers people email
their prolific

261
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,520
they get upset boy boy can they really

262
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,270
write letters and so I think what we end
up doing here by providing people these

263
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,660
passwords

264
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,410
is that they're going to just drive and
web site creators crazy and got his

265
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,370
start allowing

266
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,910
allowing them to do it ironing

267
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,620
this is it I'm sure it's a little weird
for people have passwords like this

268
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,049
%uh something you can't even type
yourself you have to copy and pasted

269
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,150
on the idea that might sketch people out
a little bit I

270
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,720
but I think a password manager sketch
people out you know they put all their

271
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,880
passwords in there

272
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,260
they already don't remember them they're
already random and they're worried that

273
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,410
you know maybe Sunday if they lose their
pastors that was the keys to

274
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,500
everything in their online life but I
don't remember anybody's phone number

275
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,439
anymore

276
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:13,669
either so I'm in and now

277
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:18,100
him and with that I I guess I kinda want
one too open up for discussion

278
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,500
on any questions

279
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,510
thoughts is this a good idea bad idea
right there

280
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,270
you were able to do create your house on

281
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,679
you actually your review to find any

282
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,319
388 but did not will be like it

283
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,959
oh yeah I checked every time no that was
not a problem actually

284
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,140
there were some inconsistencies in the
validations have these web sites so

285
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,240
for instance read it required at least 2
characters your password you signed up

286
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,400
but after that only one was required

287
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,470
other web sites but do you know required
minimum

288
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,189
up six in the on the logging and the
creation screen

289
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,319
but then the reset process for was time
I

290
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:07,319
rate and had so I will try to get a bit
what's up man

291
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:14,419
of of Lord

292
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,760
who yeah UK

293
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,770
are good now

294
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,329
yeah of here

295
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:30,510
word all yep

296
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,679
here known Wed

297
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:40,059
all well I have a really nice password
managers construct and you can

298
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:43,299
yeah but no picture it's a good point

299
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:50,299
these are password you're not going to
be able to type in pretty much ever

300
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,069
year here

301
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:07,149
in ahead there you go

302
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,120
you know when did win is interesting
what is that like it's a Latin car said

303
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,448
that defaults to you but

304
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,780
I i think we're at a time we can
encourage this at least for web use

305
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,329
because

306
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,459
where you're seeing utf8 all over the
place not a sport this very well

307
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,860
on just you had a question I was going
to

308
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:29,740
savings yep remembering what you said
before

309
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,990
one went to your master password

310
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,410
%um except you Jia a

311
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,340
huge day just even when people who
choose

312
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,740
board humour someone with German
keyboard

313
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,679
raises US keyboard and then a movies
reviews keyboard

314
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,730
founded or whatever reason

315
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,809
none I'm who doing laps to yeah

316
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,520
those are those that this is the master
password with your typing in yourselves

317
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,900
right

318
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,910
yeah and

319
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,450
thing be has where he's

320
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,809
innings you were he cites

321
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,350
all or whether it actually just getting
SAT

322
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,870
probably tried I she try oh that's an
interesting point maybe what ends up in

323
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,260
there

324
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,580
is garbage yeah but it's your garbage

325
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,939
yeah her

326
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,370
this Darby great using the same browser

327
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,439
in the same at trigger point why don't
think we have to worry about that too

328
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,149
badly with when it comes to web forms in
utf8

329
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:36,309
but I but when it but when it does come
to like hardware

330
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,899
compatibility on your local Mac sure
absolutely

331
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:43,649
up what's up just be though

332
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:46,979
browser but it the

333
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,059
website we're saying back

334
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:53,500
say I see propose dressers by

335
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,409
okay play all there you know if there
minding their characters like that that

336
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,860
they've got a bigger problem than this

337
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,719
enough for static the password should be
hashed right

338
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,759
yeah sand and a hash hash is actually a
bit shorter than forces a

339
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,950
data protection on the data at rest in a

340
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,169
still here said

341
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,690
back in because yeah his changes so much

342
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,769
up as far as Easter haitians does

343
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,460
here they changed something which
changes

344
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,820
way be yet gerald

345
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,529
right yeah Martin they might break all
the data they have stored in there

346
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:37,500
either fellow German citizen to use and
what's in the text a steward

347
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,889
a I will come back to you management at
you know gets more people in here with

348
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,168
some

349
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:46,500
Lord government

350
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,360
it but all Bank of America change

351
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,549
website alone you know I'll

352
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,789
I that you know I I really wish we had
someone here from there

353
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:01,549
to ask nappies I would ask a few other
things yeah

354
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,168
they don't seem pretty don't seem
particularly competent at anything

355
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,169
other than getting your money I am much
which is that said I guess maybe that

356
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,600
speaks for them

357
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,879
wiest Mariners does out with his

358
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,740
here I don't know but I do want actually
answer question

359
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,429
which is that %uh it looks like on their
website the when you look at the senate

360
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,129
care what once you type in S

361
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,990
a password that has special characters
in a box I'll tell you these are the

362
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,870
ones we accept

363
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,149
and it's a very limited set it says 0
through 9 a2z

364
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:36,889
capital letter capital Z and then there
but you can have a hyphen

365
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:40,178
in underscore and I think a carrot

366
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,919
and that's about it something like I
don't quite remember off the top my head

367
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,970
but the characters

368
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,200
looks suspiciously like control
characters regular expression so

369
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,269
I have this sinking feeling that
somewhere on their back and is a perl

370
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,690
script that is like out if your password

371
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,799
you know and my kids using a regular
expressions instead ever you know

372
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,830
scanning a string properly with

373
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,139
I'm you if you had a comment

374
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:08,809
yeah you says you're talking about
automatically generated yes

375
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,168
nobody's in after you Jess

376
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,759
d geez you upper and lower case letters

377
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,909
getting months length on

378
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:23,919
be mmm you've got 120 its truth

379
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,730
so I kinda

380
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,269
who are hussein of buses you

381
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,590
I agree I mean thing is I just want to
make it even more

382
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,590
I want more you know for for

383
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,360
411 or twenty-eight takes three
characters I want even higher entropy

384
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,340
and it's right there it's in there is
waiting for us i mean i i think

385
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,269
I think this lovely graph through more
from now for they can accept very clear

386
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,730
you know I think it's worth doing if
they if we can keep you know the

387
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,960
the support and technical issues low
enough but I think that you're right it

388
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,070
definitely means you know

389
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,259
probably limiting this to the web

390
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,970
I just say me sure not to go this way

391
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,059
and say generating these things

392
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,549
generation longer yep hey it's it's

393
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,658
is that it's not wrong you not run

394
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,320
up before all men just want sex anybody
