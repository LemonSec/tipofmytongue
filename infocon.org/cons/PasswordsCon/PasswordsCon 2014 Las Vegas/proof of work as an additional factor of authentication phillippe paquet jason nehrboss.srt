1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,399
I'll design teak unfortunately

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,740
the microphone was plugged in but

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,990
only into the camera and i actually into
the mixing board so afraid this is

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,570
well all the only we got for the first
14 minutes or so

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,720
so shipboard 14 minutes you don't see
the slides and

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,720
the presentation should continue from
there was sound thank you

7
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:01,259
listings

8
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,469
us is you're asking login as we were
outmanned

9
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:10,169
me that offer quest sure I asked for
additional

10
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:13,949
I'll work a Cup sport

11
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,829
his router house which covers a

12
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:22,199
site yet up trying to increase the trust
or confidence

13
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,289
0 with were factors 0

14
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,819
brand slurs I'll you mean

15
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:33,139
recall I'll salts for

16
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,319
hum the good news is that

17
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:41,519
it's all pretty much good news um or
bring up that the nonce generation may

18
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,829
be a bottleneck because it's something
that we have to do every time on all

19
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:45,709
clients

20
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,888
irregardless problem a very thing

21
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,069
and I mentioned it because we don't want
to %uh skip bball not

22
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:57,449
by try and improve performance by going
down

23
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,789
on the randomization the nonce um

24
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:04,929
the good news is approved work
verification is a fairly quick

25
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:08,429
on what you get it back it easy to
compute the answer in verifying

26
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:12,669
um it also gives us about portunity to
check the proof of work before

27
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:13,489
considering

28
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:17,029
other authentication factors on the back
end so if

29
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,789
you tried to login and you can provide
proof of work

30
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:25,409
maybe I won't bother going to you an
elder per needy your other

31
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,489
database back-end to verify any other

32
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:32,329
credentials arm and maybe locking out
account if you're not even gonna bother

33
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,098
to fill out the prof work

34
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:39,439
so mad the proof work difficulty
according to load

35
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,529
um I bring it up again cuz its

36
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,869
um sometimes the servers have especially
busy ones have problems with flash mobs

37
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:52,419
where lots are valid users come in all
at once because you're

38
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,059
a you know in the news or something and

39
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,929
this gives you the opportunity to pushed
back a lot of

40
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:05,358
valid clients and let them trickle and
as the computer all these works and has

41
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:07,889
your load increases you may push them
back farther

42
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,929
to sir to protect yourself um

43
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,809
from up so on the client side

44
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,919
about this technique is essentially a

45
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,109
slowing down the login speed um and
there's a little bit of a call the locks

46
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:25,429
um area for this um do

47
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:28,699
go to slow and you give them too much to
work

48
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,049
they're gonna end up complaining about
are slow loggins

49
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,409
and server is not responding arm

50
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,649
on the other hand if you go too fast
it's actually not enough work to be a

51
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,399
deterrent

52
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,589
for people who are trying to abuse your
system so the average computer

53
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,179
times a up a lot of these our arm

54
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,488
RT sent omits third they're OK

55
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:58,549
um the problem is mainly with the
outline airs

56
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,179
um that the average times work out
really well

57
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:05,859
but the confidence interval to come up
with

58
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,418
a the come up with an answer no one
really knows given the particular nonce

59
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,850
and since you're searching for partial
collision no one's really too sure how

60
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,279
far you have to search

61
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,959
it was either you got it right away or
could be a long time

62
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,019
um depending on where you're at um

63
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,108
and since is a javascript implementation

64
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:30,509
the JavaScript engine can make arm quite
a big kid

65
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,429
difference um even though you wouldn't
think you would be a big deal

66
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,450
um its you'll see in the next slide that
some

67
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:44,190
quite interesting um to so

68
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,119
sorry for the business lines um you will
be tested a lot of the stuff

69
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,539
um so here's some proxy execution times

70
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,230
up some are well-known hardware just to
give you an idea of what we're talking

71
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,039
about

72
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,740
um on the left you have %uh excuse time
milliseconds

73
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,970
along the bottom well what we did was we
took the

74
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,639
average number of iterations for search
upper

75
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:13,658
number up zero patents and then ran
across a bunch of different hardware

76
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,159
love the same hardware with multiple
browsers um

77
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,960
to try to illustrate um not the
difference between them but mainly

78
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,080
a couple things on one thing is is that
until you get to about 10

79
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,359
a number up zero bits I in a partial

80
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,869
collision search I'm it really is a lot
of work it just goes really fast

81
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:39,070
and its it's on par with you downloading
the

82
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,460
the actual you know script and trying to
execute it

83
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,309
um around 10-11 the number start the
climb

84
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,090
and then after that I'm things just keep
on going

85
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,269
um if we kept on kept this craft going

86
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:59,830
you would end up with the um you know
the expected to a hockey stick graph

87
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,759
that would go on um so they'll the only
other I details want to point out

88
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,820
um went to nineteen because I love

89
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,250
a couple practical problems um such as
like

90
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,940
an iPhone 4 on Sean md5

91
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,450
starts to exit need 50 seconds execution
time

92
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,149
trying to search um because I've the
outlay our problem

93
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:27,229
and I'll liar sometimes being two three
four times

94
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,039
above the average you could be in a
situation

95
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,450
at 19 bits with an iPhone

96
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,460
somebody have been executed arm it could
be taking minutes which obviously at

97
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,869
this point they think something's broken
and then they try to reload

98
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:46,029
um the other thing up no is

99
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:49,559
the differences in the JavaScript engine
um

100
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,129
you can kind of see it it's all mixed up
but some

101
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:57,549
a Mac Book Air running safari is all the
way at the very bottom

102
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,269
and at 19 that's will come in at five
seconds but the exact same

103
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,809
Mac Book Air running opera is at 25 and
30

104
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,830
so even the differences between
JavaScript engines

105
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,158
will start to diverge enough that

106
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,740
the practicality at higher bits on the
JavaScript engine is very important

107
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,950
the CPU and the differences became

108
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,080
make it Ste you know impractical for a
larger audience

109
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,960
um so long that the takeaways from Matt
is

110
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,559
um we're trying to start at a 11 bits
because it's a good place to start

111
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,639
um the average among all the platforms
is 50 milliseconds

112
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,039
um and we're ending in eighteen because
at this point

113
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,059
phone start too well be problematic

114
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,700
um and as always these are averages I

115
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,549
you could have gotten it right away it
could be faster could be um

116
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,529
a horribly slow or to believe

117
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,399
okay so we're going to a talk about that
sucks

118
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:04,189
I am jail cells mature lmao with who

119
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,700
texarkana system you can upgrade
computers a possible ok cool for school

120
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,129
ok but we saw the on what 28b Nantes
it's not going to be very party coming

121
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,439
Tomo storage

122
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,259
amid issue an essay you can do it but
for everybody else

123
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:23,470
ours that's not an option you can 12
JavaScript alert we send you

124
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,450
on the the Cebu so it's a

125
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,889
not judge fast so I was an attack it's
not very party cannot so

126
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:35,840
so that means %uh you are talking to
needs to other JavaScript engine

127
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,580
are all you can write spitz Cheika
attack code which she's a

128
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,529
ships you of budget you based are so

129
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,080
could we get a net with a GP you

130
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,470
a yes yes you can get an edge with a
jeep you

131
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,210
issue to cut to the 12th pizza out
towards you will be put off of

132
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,210
are you connect your the computes or a
certain part owner we circulators coffee

133
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,980
Cal

134
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,720
know you've got to the sixty
fifty-some-odd calls

135
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,349
so you just %uh for the 2012 of orange
number

136
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:12,619
it goes fast a

137
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:17,908
butts we cannot sue hiker what that was
and we are asking you so too

138
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:21,139
getting a bit more of complicated and if
we use

139
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,209
not on the rush but the possible
stretching it goes I'm

140
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,490
the it may not be possible to compute
certain GPA you

141
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,109
um the big thing is that agenda today

142
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:36,339
without you find a shortcut or not

143
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:41,210
does not screen touch you're going to
have to spend a psycho to compete at the

144
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,059
of what Sony way for you to get

145
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,418
Iron Age would be to find a solution

146
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,990
%uh to the pool for folks such is not an
exhaustive search

147
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,260
ISO oh you rest to do some but see if he
could to opened fine

148
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,779
shop cursor arm desserts may not be as
cool because we can't psycho

149
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,010
so I shall go is among the Snellville
ready when the fast

150
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,419
we just changes I about said okay no
you're not walking we show one

151
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,700
you're going to walk with us I first
watched

152
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,820
and into yes we're going to turned a
two-shot speak

153
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,039
all we're going to you something else
I'll

154
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,399
we also explored what we call me touch

155
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:28,739
we're going to us shoot went through not

156
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,940
1.44 but meaty purse more polls %uh
chill going to chant together I'll

157
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,839
I'll each of his who've can use it if
you want to go -ism

158
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,299
and the chin ning is on them so all you
want to attack such

159
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,379
you have to be able to do and then the
disease also walk we are asking you

160
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,839
and the fun shop for doing that arm

161
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,658
agenda did this condition is going to
catch up with you

162
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,950
issue can make a good guest within the
first

163
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,820
then guess you're good issue need to do

164
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,168
thousand get on a bus will you're going
to have to do that

165
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:13,230
very very slow D all we discarded to
walk on you

166
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,579
and up we would kid your country for

167
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,960
so it's going to cost you though um

168
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,089
we consider it such more detail and
another complication facto

169
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,119
but we would like to she's out a surgeon
and I system

170
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,839
arm to computational cost

171
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,668
offutt Oct us to be great else and a
competition or cost of Defense

172
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:39,990
all goal is to make sure that if you're
using personal spitting

173
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,659
spending 20 min psycho to defend your
purse world

174
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:47,519
so client us to spend $40 million 16 on
cycle

175
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,570
to those who mission um

176
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,519
you can read cuts out as attacks on
looking

177
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,179
on we're going to make you pay you can't
read followed in

178
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,099
as a more you're going to try some more
expensive it's going to be for you

179
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:07,089
just the compare the two Toro

180
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:11,908
you have to visit or the show going to
at times at Seaside hostage

181
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:16,700
your car is going to be more expensive
issue of a special levy clear likes you

182
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,769
want to redeem to earn a concert that's

183
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,859
a new Scottish you touch it's more
expensive as well

184
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,039
I'm that's what we have fought within

185
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,450
do you guys have heard any questions for
us

186
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,500
him I

187
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,859
after were duster times I

188
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:42,189
there was a line more like 3 steel
elimination

189
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,250
this issue same processor I'll

190
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,440
after you heroes leon

191
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,879
you know I like I'll I

192
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:57,349
go on for webster you could go
significantly faster up

193
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:02,230
I with a straight implementation energy
view is in the hundreds of millions per

194
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,929
second

195
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,169
so if you could punted down there yeah
so you you cannot so powerful allies her

196
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:08,250
site

197
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,889
used for US two twelve the Jew just but
one call for

198
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:17,029
who want to puke of Lloyds possible
solution and you can and bottle eyes out

199
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,200
but you still have to do is walk

200
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,480
you're going to spend your compute
you're going to be competing very fast

201
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,210
but you're going to have to do it so
issue under potted needs to cut the cup

202
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,980
trying to scan the one internet just
having a simple machine

203
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,359
all but net of she's too much in doing
that

204
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,908
does not going to walk in the mall you
need to omission was GB you you need to

205
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:44,369
devote special code

206
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,240
so you'll return of investment is where
the pool

207
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,919
because your computer causes very im-

208
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,929
you talked about the murals whom

209
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,349
different algorithms which I guess
fairly straightforward

210
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:03,789
here your first JavaScript 55

211
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,240
does that if not about how this would
apply

212
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,309
your mobile applications or

213
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,070
dedicated API's word you know you have
the ability

214
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,070
now one don't I well I think pardo

215
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,710
um part of the EPI was that um

216
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,980
it if we're not pushing the code
directly in a lot of cases were pushing

217
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,039
the the question to the client saying
that um

218
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,570
I want you to compute for me a other
with this nonce

219
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,809
a 12 its partial collision and then

220
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,649
at least in the JavaScript I
implementation I'm that we had some

221
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:43,809
arrays that would

222
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,990
control which algorithms and in which
order

223
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,139
to apply um in the hopes that

224
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:54,570
people trying to do optimized versions
of this would be forced to either

225
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,359
analyze it or write custom code amend
traveling together stuff that

226
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,460
um eventually would-be not fruitful for
them

227
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,339
so issue show an implementation turns
out is not using javascript

228
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:12,509
you're going to lose some flexibility
all go to long-term

229
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:17,159
use to give you JavaScript code so too
will have to execute

230
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,399
we won't tell you what's in there it
would be on the new gen or 3rd

231
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,529
and you will have to run it I is also
always a possibility to do in addition

232
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,809
to try and shock ok but consider it like
a white box crypto

233
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:36,359
you have some code sets Angeles kids at
Wood Group offer for a walk for you

234
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:39,750
I'm not telling you what it is you have
to analyze it if you want to find a

235
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,190
shocker

236
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,730
it's all part time zone and that causes
going to change

237
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,639
every time you asking for proof of
welcome

238
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,779
her %uh the corn maze days him

239
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:56,059
does birds birds birds birds border the
bus were

240
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,970
word members

241
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,169
would really

242
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,409
grim as that would be a relatively
straightforward

243
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:11,809
I into my fam them on tensions as easy
to do it's not going to be a a lot of

244
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:12,668
cool

245
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,970
support him with something like as a
search

246
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,169
he's a know you're going to have a kiss
Thomas assets lol

247
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:22,470
and you need to cast a message that said
her client so

248
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,639
user kind of technique is not widely
adopted

249
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:30,599
you're going to lose until availability
ours that's why we started with a

250
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,750
web is I'll abuse he because

251
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,129
sites easy to implement its you up in 20
probability

252
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:41,639
you have no use of returns a are its

253
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:45,279
very detail how to walk so you can try
tightening when the

254
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,849
you can look at the system because as we
all love

255
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:52,279
though shot on to your cell it yeah

256
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:55,789
and I because the self-control to play
on the it

257
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,079
dude on to the prime on poor time you
don't have Adobe that ability poor time

258
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,428
you just have your climb onto on
JavaScript

259
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,210
so with your sturgeon

260
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,259
sounds like use is

261
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,379
son dos market was

262
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:16,959
and social prevent based act like

263
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,940
some awesome them out and the classes of

264
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,089
my hitter

265
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,200
Sen my own settlers back Louis

266
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,819
know that I'll use or

267
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,819
be challenged sent base

268
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:37,918
his

269
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,730
year use yes I'm

270
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,009
even verified in st.

271
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,619
what you sent them was up

272
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:52,918
we we do use a first-hand a

273
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,700
to stop that information so we we don't
where the user database was out

274
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,389
we could use a database was out ISO

275
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:03,498
cool with your stupid decision you get a
cookie

276
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:07,679
on the I we Sutter kooky we have a
session on cell for

277
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,529
and withdrawing support I'm and you have
to own cells up or I'm

278
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:14,729
up and your at ever answer yes yeah

279
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:18,119
nerd yes yeah and and and I think the

280
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,399
the other %uh point was is as you'll see
at one point

281
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,199
um you come back with an answer and we
go ahead

282
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,239
and just take your answer and then the

283
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:32,570
use the value stored in the session to
compute it and just ignore your other

284
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,749
stuff to you gave us

285
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:38,169
assuming that they were gonna lie to us
anyway you don't have to

286
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,799
sandbags announce sutter's at such would
be

287
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,700
a if we start considering the known sir
Sandbach

288
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,749
I'll we would have to think about to
could to put a call where we coder very

289
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:51,580
fine

290
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,849
others are not sending something twice
as such in the nada nothing to walk on

291
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:56,668
your side

292
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:59,120
on sunsets the

293
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,510
party other according to solve was

294
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,920
and user questions here

295
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:14,920
thank you thank you very much a on the
shoe tree to contact us

296
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,059
and the we have free seeing on the get a

297
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,559
so it's okay to become

298
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,420
slush eagerness to please stay us plus
what's what in so the PDF for the

299
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,390
petition

300
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:31,240
self-serve pissed because it sought to
includes a javascript

301
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,410
I'm tell so walking pews you can play
with it

302
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,500
it shows you are too palmetto just don't

303
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,750
to so some parkour does a secure
implementation it's not

304
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,120
thank you so much for
