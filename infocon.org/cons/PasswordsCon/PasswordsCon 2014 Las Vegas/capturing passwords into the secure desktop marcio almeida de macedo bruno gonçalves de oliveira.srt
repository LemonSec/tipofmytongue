who you are i introduction to secure
desktop what is it what

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,800
waterworks Windows API our
proof-of-concept

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,300
mitigation and some conclusions whole
year

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,070
knowles I know some guys here no what is

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,080
secure desktop know you

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,890
i no lineal and you what is secure
desktop

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,220
your

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,320
issues hinging

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,389
yeah basically like that so

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,920
some as just to let you know this

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,700
this mainly secure desktop is not
created by Microsoft or something like

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,130
that

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,339
I is just I'll is up bracts

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,479
that some developers I don't know who
developer just to protect the

25
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,690
application from the authors process

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,440
the in the desktop so they call it
security

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,460
desktop a new some publications which
Elizabeth

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,949
to protect the some passwords in this
case

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,170
in we did something just to get through
this passwords and

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,409
this what's going on here so a little
bit about us

31
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,729
my name is brutal socially villa I'm a
senior sacred cow something at spider

32
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,390
laps

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,460
first wave I'm EMSC candidates

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,500
a just work in law weeks offs

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,489
offensive security to in the past II
give talks at that the peace ekeus a top

36
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,090
kill source boss told black hats or a
special on that goal hack in the box

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,640
third on its so true

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,768
and then we have more or so hi guys miss
me too

39
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,410
my name is my so made a thing as
security consultant and two saves by the

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:23,950
collapse

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,768
and I'm tool must must must have my time
application penetration testing

42
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:29,430
application

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,019
petition things and I mean have them

44
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,120
master degree in further interest have
been a vocal

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,470
he is a serious Brazil and I give talks
seem to get a security conference

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,299
and you shot the sheriff my so came

47
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,010
so let's start so K but what is it
secure desktop as a I'll

48
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,470
we just discuss it I am Secure Desktop
is not created by Microsoft or anything

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,720
like that is just

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,780
some practice or away

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,550
she protects I the application against

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,010
other process so

53
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,890
in this case the other process ira
malicious

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,769
so we are thinking about keystrokes me
first so

55
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,500
when East also una plication like one
password or keep

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,620
s Senor in your desktop your workstation
you're trying to protect your passwords

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:24,989
right

58
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,280
aim how you protect your password we
file

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,330
master password if you get this master
password

60
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,489
what happened so you just lose all your

61
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,020
all set the ball security never think a

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,500
in this case I'll diz is both dangerous

63
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,510
which liza the Secure Desktop true
protects

64
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,799
against a two strokes in the first which
leasing the

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,000
secure desktop so

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,560
basically said new best top created the
from the original one so

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,989
which is in the Windows API you came and
just

68
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,360
maintenance the desktops in your

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,780
works the new workstation your desktop
so you can create a new desktop you can

70
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,519
you can delete this past week these

71
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,160
is that the desktop you can and manage
Cal how many desktops you have

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,720
et cetera me the

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,050
in the end only assess said that with
the existing privileged

74
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,610
so even if you have I if you have a
user's

75
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,760
level precludes in your in your desktop

76
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,870
you're not able to create a new a new
desktop

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,440
if you don't have this kuwait's Lexus
templates

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,940
so a here is just

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,860
a note from keep s I am and you can see
in their master T on security best I'll

80
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,640
India I'll explain I a little bit more

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,229
as you can see I'm just talking about
use early entry the

82
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,550
home process simply lets because

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,540
when you when you're working leaf I
channel aims you're not

84
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,720
talking about the application but you're
talking about

85
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,400
the operating system so that's not the
point here most love you can talk

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,419
hey but I came act is now if your
keystrokes which leasing

87
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,500
I channel and Disney for right

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,990
but that's not up to us is not what we
are trying to do here

89
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,370
we are clearly we are trying to fix the
application not the

90
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,060
the operating system so

91
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,660
its so means in with just

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,080
so how does it work so

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,139
in Windows API we have these officials
from

94
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,229
desktop objects in there year

95
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,900
and there there's the lib read that you
can usually secretive ass top enumerated

96
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,940
desktops and everything that you have

97
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,270
in your workstation and again

98
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,020
its only as I said with system Pruitt's

99
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,289
I have here I am a little demo

100
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,410
just to demonstrate how I'll these
secular

101
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,500
desktop works and just real straight for
does that

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,400
don't know or wants to know the

103
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,359
and me

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,309
it's right here I don't remember

105
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:27,539
how record in so let's watch impaired
patients because I don't remember

106
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,719
okay so here I'm creating

107
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,839
processional chiles intimate rapid mean
temperature

108
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,300
just shoe any I'm going to Chili's

109
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,929
the key scum start feature from the
interpreter

110
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:45,289
in past

111
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,570
his acute

112
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,230
the Secure Desktop so I don't really
think you pass your

113
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,080
an intraday master password the soul

114
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,609
as you can see I type it the

115
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,710
the master password but I couldn't
retrieve

116
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,849
and this is how it works so it generates
a new process

117
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,030
and a new desktop

118
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,059
in myy might be for you

119
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,770
just Kisco duffers on the keys guns me
for

120
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,729
can't retrieved the what I type it

121
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,390
so this is just to illustrate

122
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,490
how whole ha this occurs desktop works

123
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,790
who

124
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,460
committee thank you sons

125
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,700
undertaking so well im I was thinking
about

126
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,729
because I have to tell you a story think

127
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:53,340
I this came this idea came from because
we had to work with an application that

128
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,960
you to visit the security this a cute
desktop

129
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,359
functionality I invisible k so

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,520
we r we were trying tool do stuff

131
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,039
on these obligation im the and then we
thought

132
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,480
pay I'll let tried to eject I

133
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,610
a pain old in the process in price so
the

134
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,940
in see what happens because to me we are
not we were not clear

135
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,500
about the security desk top in desktops
in with how it manages

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,600
so thats what we tryin

137
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,230
im its

138
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,829
a seeking young him

139
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,109
school so in this case I

140
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,389
did the same thing and then and I opened
the GPS

141
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,569
take a look on the process

142
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:49,399
Andrew I'm gonna change acts

143
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,009
another payload in the process

144
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:56,829
and

145
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:02,079
who'd

146
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,739
salsa polling inject them in them

147
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,579
I'm going to lose the

148
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,849
mickey logs me for

149
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,490
I'd just to make sure that these using
the same process

150
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,089
him

151
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:32,089
mood me

152
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,959
well

153
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,709
me

154
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,959
anymore so I I couldn't get

155
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,229
in return or in the results from there
so

156
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,290
Dept made us think a little bit more

157
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,980
an made some research to learn how

158
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,410
it works and then

159
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,529
I'll this is was I'll

160
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,430
what Gables some ideas so

161
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,349
what I was trying I I was thinking about
hey I am

162
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,350
this application we have to see we had
shimon it or we have weekend I'll

163
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,089
this is our dole in this Brian this
project week

164
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,670
we have to monitor the screen or kept 30
scream

165
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,670
or anything like that in

166
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,680
I I I could kept 30s Queen

167
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,160
this green chillies it did debate they
met up with the local

168
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,800
and and we tried this

169
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,729
we'll chill is a deviancy

170
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,250
go them

171
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,990
and to certain just general addition

172
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,620
in this case using that means if we lose
we could go to the show

173
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,870
eats wind turbines the Pinewood writers
New

174
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,940
the machine they just call for C NDY

175
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,400
in open and read the CNET open in into
the

176
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,260
the secure the spot so as you can see
this show

177
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,080
is being executed in the same desktop
thats the

178
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,840
did master she requests is running

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,420
so I don't think al king

180
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,380
so here 18 the I try I hate makes is a
cute our pain all told there

181
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:29,380
and see what happens who'll

182
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,459
I'll hope

183
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:46,459
I really like met this points birth fast
right

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,250
segment two good I'm

185
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,330
chrome

186
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,140
well now as you can see I

187
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,300
Isaac with the pain old in the same
desktop thats

188
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,599
the master key is running the key passes
renny hang them

189
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,019
our King

190
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,560
I kept route so simply the best word
from the master the master password from

191
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,489
the key best so

192
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,690
thrown their or we just learn it

193
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,940
that's anything any process that can
interact with these

194
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,550
these new Best Pop created by the

195
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,949
the master password to keep best so

196
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,120
with Ricky we freak we can interact with
those

197
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,240
with this desktop we can compromise it
so from there

198
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,459
norm

199
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,510
so became so when we see disc do his
behaviour

200
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,769
needed disagree desktop reindeer the
people

201
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,110
run since I disagree to stop and we able
to capture

202
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,399
what's height but we think it well
what's happening here

203
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,670
why needed at the other desktop we is
indeed which chapter in train

204
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,060
but when the groom's the people inside
secure the stock we're

205
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,500
able so we who search some

206
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,640
some problems and some examples in their
tuna and we farm

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,730
did this pop API in hole which works and

208
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,790
officials productions use it by the
program to

209
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,310
to create a to close the tools which
desktop so

210
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,439
here officials use it to me with bleach
this did the desktop

211
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,990
okay the storm when you calls him

212
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,970
it grows at this bar this second one
creates one the

213
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,670
31 and hitter and already office trains

214
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,209
we've all names of the desktops running
the session get threat to stop

215
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:48,819
it earned it act Dec to the stop up for
example if you have for Omar desktops

216
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,140
and

217
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,360
doing those the desktop activity to you

218
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,540
is that threat at this club okay and

219
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,719
they're open to stop an open book
desktop give you permissions to

220
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,459
through run program in person inside him
cetera desktop use at

221
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,910
they act all the stops to to 2 comments

222
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,020
an ls1

223
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,730
you switch to desktop for example if you
decided that that

224
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,690
the full desktop and we'll total to
honor to stop them

225
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,000
you can switch this cop shoots which the
top between okay

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,399
so it's the functions we see whole week
hope used

227
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,010
then but tool to explain

228
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,079
yene white the do

229
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,469
when you call the process inside the
secret to stop works

230
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,940
is because of that didn't Windows API

231
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,860
this session has inside him one or more
with the station

232
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,720
inside of went to the station you have
Walmart desktops okay

233
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
and said the desktop you have programs
process use a reboot

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,120
everything Sharon between so because
that when you read a problem

235
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,020
or process inside the same to stop you
able to capture everything

236
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:06,089
okay so why not done is not work when
your car is agreed to stop because that

237
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:06,620
because

238
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,140
this desktop solution because when you
run a broader

239
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,310
side up that the hold a spot you know
when you eat direct directory for secure

240
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,979
The StockGuru

241
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,990
are unable but has one thing since you
are

242
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,720
sided thing when the station were able
to tool same columns and send

243
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,740
and start process insight the order to
stop

244
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,850
not directly for him so we think it okay

245
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,110
so let's create opera concept when

246
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,420
we did not interact directly for another
process we just

247
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,199
run are came under inside other to stop
by and see what happens

248
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,579
so dissolves or purple concept

249
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:48,130
or up corporal just and

250
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,050
using the its agree to stop the PI we
just really another program

251
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,260
inside the secret to stop and the other
problem we'll do

252
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,709
what the what they need to do to capture
everything because

253
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,569
they will bypass that this occurs
protection from daughter to stop book

254
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:06,660
when when the programs running the same
to stop the protection

255
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,750
isn't as X and more so is a perfect
concept

256
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,260
but the we did did what we develop in

257
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,020
Christophel rerun open desktop tool

258
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,439
to open them daughter to stop what you
want we want to interact

259
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,240
after that you set the trend at the stop
to discussed desktop

260
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,579
after that we create a process Miss K's

261
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,819
I research brozak brought among the
show's process

262
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,969
okay needs and ok keylogger skis

263
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,170
you we use it are is to kill order is up
to ridicule operator

264
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,620
written internets not in text me user

265
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,860
sole use here is the code sorry for
that's barely

266
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,029
but we're not go there's just think
there's there's

267
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,120
but the and we create our way through

268
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,189
and gets their veins of all the stops

269
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:00,240
and when we found one new just

270
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,730
launch a new process sole principal
we're running

271
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,939
did before the stop program starts stock
can log into the for this book

272
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,929
okay so when you start the key pairs all
possible one Passaro

273
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,159
any program that uses agree to stop we

274
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,620
injected a new payload to starch old

275
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:23,010
much was processed just days we'll just
call a CD

276
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,740
and I'll CD lets show ok your

277
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,620
in I'm

278
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,709

com min

281
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,070
okay we'll show two you two programs
diffuse one

282
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,500
just call disunity okay we start here

283
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,880
when you launch I'm

284
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,340
the wheel get all the stops name Spain
start to sing D

285
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,800
okay just did now we will start

286
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,190
a program little to to attempt ethic

287
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,790
a key pass is running

288
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:18,790
ha in home

289
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:25,279

Soderling coach D I'm

293

the site the secret to stop and the
muster key

295
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,850
soul in theory if we have I'll

296
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,949
keylogger running site the secret to
stop

297
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,730
better that moment the user never know
that

298
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,500
and have these his best work up to it
okay no

299
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,960
we show to you running

300
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,300
we've or keylogger being

301
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:17,649
hop to computer back

302
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,610
Shin country King

303
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,490
pursues closes on

304
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,650
go of

305
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,940
and start daughter does one

306
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,960
restart the restart seculow Norton every
desktop machine

307

and when I i start a new desktop dearest

308
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,250
it jacked a keylogger inside is that
desktop to

309
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:49,480
them use running

310
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,100
cocaine messy desk manager

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,709
desktop injector sarin hearing

312
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,220
and they just mister

313
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,260
injected the one but is the geez long

314
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,660
is our monarchy longer running beautiful
desktop

315
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,740
okay so we'll run the KeePass again

316
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,530
well

317
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,420
and here are you type my password bursts

from time home

319
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:32,210
secure desktop him

320
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,510

due to its more goes is key logger

333
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,730
just an urgent dogs during

334
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,170
30 seconds or I room units here

335
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,930
%um everything I type it

336
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,870
the the desktop is our is located

337
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,689
so usurper

338
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,250
concept I'm

339
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,220
them what we debate

340
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,320
mitigation dis the

341
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,740
we use we have got just jar
recommendation

342
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,080
okay lease it now sessions elation

343
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,379
because if you Preet a new session

344
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,070
and all this session you start a new
desktop

345
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,270
everything you want you you have a
totally

346
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,240
is elation is not matter if you can try
0

347
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,940
going to racks if did they stop you are
in a bit too

348
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,420
to do that and yep

349
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,750
we don't not only person just a
recommendation

350
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,830
okay but the syrup investors we know
that

351
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,679
and hijack concessions as possible okay
so

352
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,600
we not rides totally if we hijack a
session and trying to

353
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,770
everything to to do that we don't
finally best Nick we needn't

354
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,180
more research but we think we really
think that we'll

355
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,570
we'll solve the problem and we have
another solution

356
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,060
created by one Password address in DC VA

357
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,370
you where dissolution is very

358
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,120
very interesting he just when you launch
their one pass or

359
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,669
the the tact if it has another process a
program running the security stop

360
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,700
and when detect is dis problem just
close at the stop

361
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,830
and an alert the user pay

362
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,850
has another process a program running so
you're secure the stop

363
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,090
soul taker soldiers sole

364
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,040
