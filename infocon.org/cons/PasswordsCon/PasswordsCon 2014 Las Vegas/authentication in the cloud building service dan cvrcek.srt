1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:08,070
mmm been

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm

3
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,300
that we're going to start again

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
gotten I'm happy to introduce

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,718
Tom space in energy at

6
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,109
I switching from some different covered
I

7
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:47,160
I had I such him up the home better

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,190
I'm I'll spring I went on to you

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,289
who this another recent

10
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:58,829
going on there that moment I i'm looking

11
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,359
alluded to up as ridge's

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,830
does talk I like most

13
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,920
yet I have I would really like to come
in and talk to you about products

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,110
solutions well I am anguish

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,140
I'm he said yes just won't

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,590
office Southall on our way through me
small

17
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,330
groupings House Oversight Holden usual
resubmit

18
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,810
all house home whole so why not

19
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,870
dont she's jewish around a good

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,250
I'll hello I

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,880
looks like I'm not the only one who's
feeling like it's early hours

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,080
up in you

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,120
begins yes right suction trying to be
close to it

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,340
up all talk about stuff to peak

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,590
Kyle started a bit working on beginning
of the year

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,900
but really it'd hard about two months
back so

27
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,340
up I was hoping to show you

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,560
live demonstration of hold the device or
system works but well

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,378
approach to leave it for all well one or
two weeks time

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,439
if you're interested I'm so our vision

31
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,920
well I've been marking not Social
Security

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,309
up its cryptographic better the ground

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,349
in academia and so I've been talking for
like 12 as well

34
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,540
her so I so how banks are being crypto

35
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,719
I realized that one of the problems with
script re: that

36
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,819
if you want to do it reasonably well you
need to

37
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,048
specialized hardware means hot too get

38
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,530
a I'm even harder to to use so our
vision was to build something serious

39
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,969
easy secure an affordable in

40
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:50,189
and and you are basically can use it up

41
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:53,549
just a good idea I'll one balks which is
called

42
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,069
hi persecuting what you'll will cost you
all fifteen thousand dollars

43
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,200
up straight of and then probably five

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,010
South endorse every year for support up

45
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,709
it's not easy to use and to support to
pay for

46
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,280
will not of it up occasions yes to I'll

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,260
do that just yourself so

48
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,349
easy and secure and affordable are the
other poppin course

49
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,790
too broad application support I'm not
cryptographic functions

50
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,939
usually if you want to do some snow belt
you don't want

51
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,828
grew up a yes encryption but you want to

52
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,310
protect email all all riddick passports
all

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,969
0 I don't know up make you all

54
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:42,400
upgrade cop number storage will secure
and

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,579
the law school was to build something
that is scaleable

56
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,359
so you can use it if you want to five
times a day log on to your website

57
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,049
but the same way you can use it if you
could have too many on our customers

58
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,019
using a service

59
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,239
seige two scenarios

60
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,340
up at condo for show what we wanted to
do so much that you'll see to your

61
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,749
Dropbox all Bank of America I'll
something

62
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,959
and Dipti in both new function full

63
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,499
up for a business that will bring you a
little money up

64
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:15,969
you've tested up and now you want to
turn it on and put it into although

65
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,790
virtual machines that you got round the
world

66
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,400
all been a problem is that because he
won't provide some kind of security

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,599
you need to disputes eye-catching piece
around the world

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,000
so Gidi Easter to you

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,150
take I know few lawyers I'm

70
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,679
up queued them some physical tokens
rates up

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,980
thank you Shin peace on the potential
description

72
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,960
how to keep should be used sons and
cuban leaders do to center

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,169
they'd like the Mina 0

74
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,510
to use ki Baraat sleep they can use some
kind of altercation

75
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,840
tokens and when they leave a magic
happens and

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,469
the key southern available in all
virtual machines around the world

77
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,970
and polar customers can use in your
application

78
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,970
so the second scenario is soft yet
simple spectrum

79
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,280
up now we all see octo I'll

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,630
I'll bozo very boy

81
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,790
missing your on startup you're very good
in developing applications designing use

82
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,670
interface

83
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,740
but you have no idea what securities
about

84
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,640
but the ideas about creating virtual
world required cool

85
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,909
to create some asserts that you can
protect so no one can steal them

86
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,330
up so what you do you go to website use

87
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,479
select from the list what kind of
functions you want

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,860
you click on them up after a bit of so

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,700
description you can copy paste up few
lines of code that you just put 20

90
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,229
application and off you go or down

91
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,440
so these are visions or scenarios that

92
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,469
would ruin up would really like to see

93
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,200
up so I've been talking about secure
device cease

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,289
service in the clout and the next

95
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,290
think you promise I E spall I don't
really trust

96
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,090
much up so I try to say what I mean by
those terms

97
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,330
I'll secure device East tamper-proof
device ease

98
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,550
fairly expensive specialized a Kate

99
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,540
up when you try to open it for a race
everything that is in sight

100
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,860
up it would get certification so there's
like what why programs that will certify

101
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,900
devices called

102
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,210
troops 140 dash through up

103
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,890
I don't say it's perfect but is probably
the best we can do at the moment

104
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,539
up and put the device East do

105
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,160
paid that this up he put something
inside it will never

106
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,500
leave the device result encryption

107
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,640
so if you put in key you can all make
exported

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,650
as a negative key so you even if you
read that

109
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,840
nothing happens in

110
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,169
up hosted service up it's gone off

111
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,240
tricky because been like chameleons of
having

112
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,430
our applications for every goal up on
the other hand to be

113
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,240
don't like big companies to on our date
up and be able to

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,620
posit ate up to well as they want all
I'm

115
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,990
I'll tend to do up

116
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,010
so trust is okey key word here

117
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,659
and refile after Publishing Co

118
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,260
sort of results for first proof of
concept the route two types of proves

119
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,969
you can

120
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,410
are you should a problem must if you
want to be successful provide

121
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,030
one is very easy to understand up

122
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,489
i'm looking proves that any on it can
understand

123
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,570
and say yet that looks cool

124
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,990
and then there must be proper proof that
luxury show someone who understands

125
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,710
the stuff knows ok for a few works what
kind of stress

126
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,989
other can do reasonable risk analyzes
say yet the stuff it's actually really

127
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,340
good

128
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,460
up don't know my feeling 'cause it's the
first one is probably more important

129
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,930
but old exit to to your judgment

130
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,690
hmm so another

131
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,990
so full interesting fact that I learnt

132
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,130
I didn't realize that much before
Wallace up the lock people up

133
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,360
meeting to discuss with you security but
if you try to explain what you do these

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,749
likely I'll slowly moves call post
saying call right to do that so

135
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,819
what about this up and the say that
every single problem is the biggest

136
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:40,639
problems a

137
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,790
they have was actually putting behind it
some kind of

138
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,990
reasoning what is your threats and what
is there is called it should happen Inc

139
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,990
and do you want to protect it protect
the yourself against it or store right

140
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,639
so up poss was probably one of the main
reasons why we talk about passwords

141
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,029
are large-scale possible peaks

142
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,910
if it wasn't for them and someone
sometimes just stolen someone's past for

143
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,430
it would be part of 0 i conference you
but prevent

144
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,670
though so widely visible

145
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,790
up a good couple slides of Wat

146
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,959
big companies can do are doing or

147
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,050
basically what they try to do is to
separate logic business looking into

148
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,729
several

149
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,589
section so loyal to top isolated so

150
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,930
the thing that your browser will hate is
so probably the publication

151
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,060
that may contain some logic maybe not

152
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,248
but certainly will not contain any use
our customer data

153
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,569
once the request is received to be
forwarded on

154
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,498
on work too actual business logic the
tool to fix a stool

155
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:58,579
customer data will provide for a
functionally 12

156
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,109
up want to get and

157
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,300
the the company's really good it often
as a liar

158
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,449
that will do the authentication up one
reason for the baby just centralization

159
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:15,109
I'll making also take a shower and
basically just one back end systems that

160
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,949
will surf

161
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,120
alt number of different applications

162
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,730
sewed each of the segments will be
firewall also

163
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,769
well may have different to different
physical access

164
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,819
different fermentation methods and so on
in

165
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,939
our shoes are really good so summer
humans according to use one of those

166
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,059
expensive computer devices docs restore

167
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,129
well keys atop use to protect your
passports

168
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:47,259
secrets faulty p all whatever I'm

169
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,459
if you build your own web application
are you using

170
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,479
ok local CMS system I miss you my that

171
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,499
genuine certainly con do that

172
00:10:56,499 --> 00:11:00,519
you very often and up was basically just
one space that contains

173
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,050
I'll the publication business logic

174
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,059
and passports on data I use it as well

175
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,189
up internal clock if pretty much empty

176
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:15,349
and one someone hacks into this up
you're done medically can export

177
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,649
all dump orders they wanted

178
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,649
up still be talking about passports i
birdied apostles are not that has so

179
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,259
many

180
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,199
many optical strike to say and

181
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:34,029
there is a few reasons for that so some
say that OD be the best thing to replace

182
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,279
pa sports

183
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,629
so my question is so why do I have to
and Turpin

184
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,629
or even possible acquits with otep

185
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:45,949
if his replacement up another thing is
change response

186
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:49,979
it's quite cool it's very nice basic ish
each time I want to look in saree

187
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,610
sons be something that is unique will
never repeat I have to do some kind of

188
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,999
computation

189
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:59,309
the promise to do the computation I need
something to do it

190
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:04,709
op so he's I have to have it in my
pocket or some hope but to computer

191
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,118
up biometrics that works pretty well for

192
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:12,069
although for the policeman's they want
to identify you but not supped

193
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:15,839
not that well Iran's readers in your
bedroom and you can play with it and do

194
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,699
whatever

195
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,649
tricks you want up and also false
rejection forced

196
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:24,879
false acceptance rates are quite high
for many of the techniques

197
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,180
all the qualities that are available

198
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,800
up saw mention here before project
because we can reach

199
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,920
which basically but was a try to do is

200
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,040
I'll verify identity

201
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,420
which number of small devices a that can
talk to each other

202
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,550
so if you got 405 for those devices

203
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,339
that can talk to each other they can
establish identity ProLite

204
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,100
authentication credentials and
automatically love you into a computer

205
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,309
if you will be shown here

206
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,319
needed if you just

207
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,559
is someone not just deals your a ball
fall your incall

208
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,670
up couples also items tossing it will
not help them

209
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,389
so I think the possible site to stay for
a while

210
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,220
and the question is what we can do do
with them yeah here's one

211
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,249
comparison of possible snow D be that up
some people don't realize

212
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:26,360
up for news possible by sistema then
database

213
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,410
contain scrambled passports so i'd type
in my new one

214
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,189
%uh still scrambling to compare the sky
but versions and says yes or no

215
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,300
safe I had the server a customized
version I have to do some kind of work

216
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,990
to figure out for Georgia possible
course if I use OOTP

217
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,990
then I'll tell you something to compute
Michael T peacoat

218
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,839
it will go to the server by the server
through some competition

219
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,929
it means using the same secret that is
used for computing

220
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,579
every single TP value from now towards
the end of school all the time

221
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,589
so is someone hacks mice are a gain

222
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:06,220
they get that secret and they don't have
to do anything because it has to be

223
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,899
stopped playing

224
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,069
in plain text

225
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:13,878
so deep is great to include tool a

226
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,379
introduce freshness in time somebody
who's that I sent when I talk to you

227
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:18,100
again

228
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,149
but not so good if I just want to simply
implemented in software

229
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,579
from the service point of view

230
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,420
up so mort is the main problem of

231
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,420
ma Sports Hall syndication so here is a
small scam updates on flights there is

232
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,790
like me you was there

233
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,170
i buy you some kind of device a

234
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,839
that will help me too connect my PC

235
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,259
on the PC I can if I was ok piece of
software that will help me improve

236
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,399
security can be special experts
indication what your

237
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,300
all something else on that Wilson

238
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,559
credentials to the server back and that
will do little

239
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,170
hot syndication and will say in CNTs on
all

240
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,719
up givens a publicist the basically the
importance

241
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,449
of all leaks all hacks of service
programs lost

242
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,139
bit is most important or dominant at the
moment

243
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,759
so let's try to find out if we can do
something

244
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,889
gonna help it somehow in

245
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,949
so back to the initial idea up I mention
HSM that can buy today

246
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:30,199
up basically when you buy 2 buy books

247
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,399
so you baby as you want to zip little
all lot you pay to fix price

248
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,300
up it's not that powerful market can do
both

249
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,979
6,000 are seeing pictures per second

250
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,709
its %um verse on symmetric encryption

251
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:51,059
up and it's very hard to manage in terms
of key management so if you want to

252
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,738
to show on peace inside it's not so easy

253
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:58,319
up both being Mubarak on

254
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,839
doing call building is something very
pay as you go

255
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,059
it will be much more powerful be very
fast for symmetric encryption as well so

256
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,269
you can use it for qualifications for
anyone tractor plush

257
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,319
mile mall so data

258
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,759
and foremost it has to be very easy to
manage and use

259
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,860
so basically it is cryptography device

260
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,170
or other service the Toby suitable for
the clock

261
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,839
are available through the clout in

262
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,040
son Beau January thomma build surfable
concept

263
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,769
up wanna miss it alright so let's use
while the dongles we got

264
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:39,470
up unemployment very simple password
encryption for service

265
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,040
the idea was up instead of hashed
passwords the desirable

266
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,379
our store and cryptic passports oooh
make

267
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,019
so it's not reversible up

268
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:53,970
but if someone tries to pick your
virtual machine with your CMS system

269
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,279
all they get is basically just included
file so we can even publish our

270
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:58,999
passports

271
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:02,199
all on your own 21 Donald bill

272
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,779
not help them sordid

273
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:09,449
that the perks for me nicely basically
if you want to use it

274
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,120
you just use so basically open the file
from you are over your ugly sitting

275
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,239
and you can use it so the hot various
block to the device was its

276
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,559
Raspberry Pi oil server doesn't matter

277
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,709
on people that is built but service dis
basic interface Inc

278
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,850
up to harbor device read so with your
client

279
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,340
so from PHP piped and Java

280
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,260
any language you can basically using
just couple of lines have called

281
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,309
up quickly implement will start using
this

282
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,309
I'm even though it's very cheap

283
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:50,090
in a very small you custard about
200,000 Logan's per day

284
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,158
just under backed so

285
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:56,980
we were quite encouraged because people
seem to like it and

286
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,840
ago some kind of truck show so he sought
maybe Scott some like certain

287
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,110
let's build something that would make it
but broke

288
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,918
proper product sourced I think about
system architecture

289
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,200
all and be

290
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,610
because reply quick smart card slot
before well done

291
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,320
all over good spot cause for a number of
different vacations

292
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,289
resort let's build some small spot cops
advantages a spot guy sexually

293
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:27,390
as secure as that very expensive Asia
some

294
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,600
in terms of security certification you
can get the same

295
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,850
certificate for smart card s what s

296
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,580
now what if you put what's a fire sauce
pot got into books

297
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,330
we get very big fairly reasonable

298
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,860
up device for its

299
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,918
quite significant computational power

300
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,490
up but because we got so many of them me
too many should somehow so

301
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,049
we split them into publication costs
that much reduced of

302
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,230
there is some control card that will
help many church up

303
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,760
she's that are used by spot Cox on there
is some

304
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,110
summit wrested control which is
basically normal PC which processor

305
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,519
I'll so if you want to use it if you
want to push some kind of peace

306
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,769
up inside you lucite cart the two can
block inside

307
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:22,169
doesn't matter which way you up in

308
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,500
what you'll 0 we date of your

309
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,159
customer keys into it too but your
privacy salutes miles away

310
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,789
maybe because all the devices creates of
Chris cryptographic

311
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:37,840
people typically secure cluster once it
is in sight

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,639
beez devote device on a smart cards
uninterrupted

313
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,419
so basically what we do that pic move
the secure a boundary of secure space

314
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,490
much closer to deduct where it is
processed he basically just around so

315
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,649
microcontroller which is a smart card
itself the smart card chip

316
00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:01,080
that allows us to put it in a box with 0
normal PC Pentium processor whatever

317
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,970
because that one doesn't have to be
fully trusted because it will never see

318
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,970
plantings data point XP unless you want
it in

319
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,000
up so for prototypes were thinking court
who want is very simple management

320
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,570
operational API so it's easy to use a
deployed

321
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,610
so far sinking she ever use for
something stand up like because he is

322
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,830
still a minute just under 2
cryptographic API

323
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,168
or show the build something that can be
tailored to applications so if I just

324
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:32,690
want

325
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,480
possible eviction I can use one or two
functions for that

326
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,289
and I don't have to worry about the rest
of the stand up to implement it

327
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,450
having said that PKC isoenzymes got a
lot of problems

328
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,529
up on its own just got a little research
and

329
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,580
few companies that are making money just
to show

330
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,908
which products I'll have which problems

331
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,549
well in because he got so many

332
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,720
small Michael controls that can work
together

333
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,179
we're definitely want to do some kind of
load balancing up

334
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,460
and scalability in

335
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,010
up we can do that public and dynamic
allocate %uh spot cost to users at

336
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,169
a are using device at that moment most
so if you

337
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,360
suddenly got who

338
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,269
up a lot of work to do we can use
basically the whole device

339
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:29,330
issues that little other compounds users
can use so

340
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,350
up use it more in

341
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,610
the design goals to first one ace

342
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,209
simply simplicity make it very simple to
use

343
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,120
don't put in there any options once you
put option for you will present will try

344
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,090
to sing about the options and they will
probably choose or

345
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,039
shoes are ok one scalability

346
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,200
clusters being able to use disaster
recovery production system

347
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,750
like it's Caleb Lee fun device fails you
can easily switch over to another one

348
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,950
and try to focus so so fun problem

349
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,330
which is basically just protectees of
for the back and

350
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,279
and make allow users to use them secure
in

351
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,159
so where we are now are so you got to
offer strict balto

352
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,669
with some cocks inside to redesigned so
extension board

353
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:25,789
so we got some development platform this
boat

354
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:28,970
my pitches long so it's not very big

355
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,149
0 and is this so this bottle August

356
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:36,600
bout thousand tracked to crypto
transactions per second

357
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,649
in which is comparable to big Keisha
subs

358
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,649
in

359
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:48,059
so in

360
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,860
deal difficult bit ices upon the keys
inside the box

361
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,918
that it's easy you can encrypt it been
exported

362
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,840
and only depicted insights podcasts
difficult but is structurally

363
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,908
push peace into that environment

364
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:07,320
there are different ways the I mention
two scenarios admit that the beginning

365
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,600
one is that offer low cost low I want to
do it but idk very

366
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,649
quickly and easily it one Bush I can do
some computation my PC

367
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:20,059
the day ties encrypt it when transported
but actually

368
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:25,240
there's certain limit how much I can
modify words a key is going

369
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,590
G the opposite extreme is actually
physically deliver

370
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,730
the keys in 2003 I'll shares

371
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,110
into the box physically plug it was a
the device

372
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,149
on that you can make sure that the keys
don't

373
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,508
don't go anywhere else

374
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:44,789
so the process is very simple will it be
you can't create object

375
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:48,210
robotic by by the correctly 0

381
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,489
insight inside so %um the device

382
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,240
well using it I'm number you were gay
single phase

383

Upton Denver loaded gun

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,889
optimize corporation 0 one thing that we

391
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,189
are quite ok to kill about is it even if
you

392
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,639
was a keen that derives you can't use it
indefinitely

393
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:54,809
3 want to use it you have to issue some
sleep well

394
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:58,440
dorgan's his time limited or use limited

395

the Don it worked last month the token

398
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:11,570
the will allow it ready to do some are
you

399
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,809
so I didn't mention the magic at the
beginning

400
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:19,559
actually would also the lawyers could do
that they can go to the same nicholson

401
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,029
for

402
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:23,659
unplug would probably love their and
very shortly all to cope

403
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,679
all copies of the key will be destroyed
more on summer basically

404
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,549
because there will be no low-cost a able
to issue

405
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,309
more tokens for using the key so there
may be just think it did

406
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,700
up blood flowed a top the will be

407
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,440
of no use in

408
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,590
may create the embers do you get another
case a message

409
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,449
with so was interpreted possible so we
can start a database or compare it to

410
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,809
what is taught as database

411
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:52,980
in up

412
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,580
I mentioned to so for question about
creating very simple

413
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,840
easy to verify API 10 through 0

414
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,570
Kaman's are you something so funny Jerry

415
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,939
interesting that we discussed it with
some people from became just use that

416
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,360
doing simple hughes BBC a Sylvan up

417
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,559
it's very hard to find developers
wilkens don't and implemented used

418
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,620
correctly

419
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,860
if you something to go three call moms
one is very five possible or

420
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,309
bonus I know create user

421
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:30,120
up though probably get it right

422
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,370
well I talk about user object so it's
not only the key

423
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,889
up but also it can be a sequence of

424
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:41,059
of commodity can do with a key or set of
keys

425
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,639
so we can create more complicated
operation

426
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:48,519
up to make prisons a secure environment
so we don't have to encrypt something

427
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,059
more effective supply and I'll movie
back saying now I want to sign it

428
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:56,908
I can say this is a day Toppenish want
to do and picture and

429
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:02,500
age Mac optics or eat with something
else you can do it all in one go

430
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,330
on the last disc 1 versus session
oriented up

431
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,259
the body's response but if you can do it
just basically simple count datagram

432
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,630
approach because you can do without

433
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,340
hassle of creating session some
distribution call all

434
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,049
managing sessions in

435
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,690
up so bottom line we build something new
but in fact securities

436
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,879
built on products that off from of
vendors to be in need

437
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:33,918
of manufacturing smart cards and secure
devices for

438
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,730
quite a long time and they know how to
do it what to tell you could build

439
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,360
is layer on top the to allow to use a
large number of

440
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,799
so computational limit to do I ceased
and

441
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,168
give you scalability that you may need
for all

442
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,710
applications in the cloud

443
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,740
because the boundary now is much closer
to the date up

444
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,629
you don't have to protect the whole
briquemont so we comparable but it but

445
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:00,620
he created

446
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,689
up important is so all security license
smart card because they are

447
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,990
in her into hock to open and extract any
any secrets from

448
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,799
having said that you can still do a lot
of work

449
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,029
using only lot I'll memory so if you on
poppers smart card to loose all today

450
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:20,379
because it was talkin sir

451
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:27,379
in

452
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,259
soviet I'm just so beating Cup spot
costs can be fifty

453
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:34,950
140 upset if I pitches same level
security

454
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,840
from cryptographic point of view as you
can get from picture sums

455
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,580
but you can buy one spot cop for five
quid

456
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,629
of Monica so for ten thousand quid

457
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:50,149
so that's it up its Kyle summary up

458
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:53,729
background is so a couple 40 well
charles from first just to have been

459
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,090
doing

460
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,490
there's some old information you can
find on about that the LOB data

461
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,720
in next couple two or three weeks and
get if you got any questions all

462
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,929
well would like to dusted plate wrong
just get in touch

463
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:13,779
be very happy to yet can you access and
work with you

464
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:20,779
think %um any questions them

465
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,360
if i understood correctly you mean talk
about in your in your

466
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,500
kinda hard worked her to you talked
about the the collection at a smart

467
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,759
cards in the controller was kinda listed
is

468
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,649
semi trusted in I'd like to dig into
their little bit because

469
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:42,600
it seems like that controller is with
granting access to the smart cards

470
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,939
so I would think that it would need to
be really trusted in order to make sure

471
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,330
that it's not granting access to a smart
card to the wrong person

472
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,428
min well it days some a trusted

473
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:58,360
but it really merck's a so-called
Message Broker so we basically finds a

474
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,969
cart

475
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,049
those goods are right object and if you
try to

476
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:06,399
forward the message through wrong cart
music is a cop just don't have the key

477
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,830
that is necessary for perforation

478
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,360
so if you want to incubate I'll just
incubators different one

479
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,250
up what I didn't mention a date in the
survey to promote that we just

480
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,629
a the using at the moment ob-gyn
Creepshow all data protection is and to

481
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:23,090
end

482
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,120
so it stops in your application and at
San

483
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,639
inside the cocked so if you want to put
as a solemn top

484
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:34,370
as a solvent will end up towards the
bill entered the controller

485
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,928
but the up and to encryption update up
ghost all the way to the smart cause a

486
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,919
spark of connect deacons date up

487
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,529
if you worry about that could do all
depressions in sight

488
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:48,169
and then encrypt protect the other is
often send it back to them

489
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,360
it definitely helps thanks been

490
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,408
more yeah I yet I'm

491
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,940
alright one more question
