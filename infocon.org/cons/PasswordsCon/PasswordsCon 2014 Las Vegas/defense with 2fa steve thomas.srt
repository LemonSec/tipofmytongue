1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
be mmm be okay

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,309
this is my good friend Steve Thomas I
he's gonna talk about

3
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,590
defending with you back for syndication
I am

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,960
that's it agency %ah

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,609
so

6
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,830
a s as the reset I'm Steve he may know
me escapes

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,160
so a

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,279
he different types a a

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,649
you factor authentication inside time
base

10
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,079
topky I it's usually just like six digit

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,450
and that dongle tells you or

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,600
smartphone I usually it's a quite

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,739
96 pets private key some for

14
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,760
then there's a challenge response I this
is

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,930
usually more secure because our there's

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,220
it's usually like a large G with handy

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,280
responses just like six digits its

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,750
hash output from like up age Mac

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,820
had there's counter mode

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,559
I bike hockey which is

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,240
somewhere to you talkie %uh in that it

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,309
has security summer

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,950
paid six bucks and it's a six digit PIN

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,259
pay taking I'll there's unit G

25
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,630
which is basically I

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,289
ATS in cryptid China Road replace mother

27
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,799
deals your which is fairly scare out

28
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,170
he only thing with that is that its

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,509
most is starting I'll

30
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,509
authentication as a service so %uh

31
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,219
it but my everyone usually leaves

32
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,318
ya Depot GN which but only works with

33
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,730
UGG they have the her

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,269
out basically cher je where pagers have
HSR has

35
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,459
an encrypted version of it well cue

36
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,569
transit thanks %uh so anyone that

37
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,910
gets answer anti 29 just say

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,459
yes its some hair

39
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,690
but its probably K

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,480
arm than SMS so self-harm

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,819
but yeah sheen go

42
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,910
yet

43
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,109
scientists it's like quote like are a
sec

44
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,709
0 or Parker 0

45
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,010
I no but well this

46
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,109
on not eating all but much more I was

47
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,370
ask I

48
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,129
so the threats a stone tasered

49
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,290
from basically than

50
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,540
it relies and so we on the second factor

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,980
so for top he or I

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,549
hockey %uh those with sixty Japan

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,110
%uh your password is done basically

54
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,230
bout to get in you happy break a sixty

55
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,640
arm so lost or stolen

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,980
of storing second factor bennett's

57
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,988
normal just passer arm

58
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,159
so he won so workflow on the earlier

59
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,400
are much Marvo euros battle per

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,670
but ISO the next you I online guessing

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,530
from that its I'll mmm

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,750
from a then there's timing

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,150
tax such a mile I've

64
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,470
pressure and I'll the

65
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,819
so there's I'll her online cussing

66
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,909
you wanna rate limit I

67
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,959
you know per user per IP its separate
ipv6

68
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,570
other China doesn't matter anymore
because she's

69
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,389
he's and you can actually get like a
32-bit

70
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll network address you

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,050
that eat me cycle for so a

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,190
but for the time being and even at you

73
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,690
so you still showed rate limit ot

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,310
yeah checker %uh

75
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,320
so you wanna check both from

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,020
make sure that you don't say which one
fails

77
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,049
because than a it's basically be
security 0

78
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,250
pass written to strengthen your password
times strength

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,070
he to tractor or your password

80
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,870
plus de facto so if your password is
like you take

81
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,050
a billion gases Andy two factors knowing
gases

82
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,270
he I'll a million up

83
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,130
one point so 001

84
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,600
billion gases for plus order

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,910
%uh say doing all I don't yet

86
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,220
so one hard drilling it should be I'll

87
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,090
lot harder gene very

88
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,770
timing text but so you don't wanna say
which one felt before

89
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,830
this about so what you don't want to
happen

90
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,520
is let's say you have a really strong
password hashing

91
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,310
over them that takes you know a decent
time

92
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,080
if you check the second factor first and
then just return

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,710
that and you'll know that the second
factor is problem

94
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,198
about also I'll

95
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,910
about timing text don't really work
Chigwell because

96
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,160
he thing that you're trying to get keeps
changing

97
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,419
for the second factor but

98
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,789
it's still I'll important to check

99
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,199
stop second factor possibly hair

100
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,580
in constant time so there's out for like
at the time

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,180
base once I usually check

102
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,100
to be foreign to you after so 8 covers
like

103
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,539
five minutes in case times you

104
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,639
so it even if you do actually about find
the code correctly

105
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,039
you should check all five just in case
yards

106
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,590
yeah they're very close to you so that
they can actually tell

107
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,039
arm

108
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,090
but obviously you wanna check both yes
on

109
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,159
help home so this is basically so that
you can have

110
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,389
yup password strength: times

111
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,530
June factor I'll if you do you check

112
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,650
he second factors first and then check
the password

113
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,388
but that is almost equivalent you

114
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,039
a multiplication because you have to
keep guessing

115
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,349
ya she factor which keeps changing texts
replay

116
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:15,319
I'm us there are replay you know you can
just keep sending saying

117
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,660
up gas over and over just keep saying

118
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,810
yes up and less the second factor

119
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,849
she cites for about its small

120
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,740
there is actually a case where a company
thought they're using

121
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,550
96 bits but they're using forty-eight so

122
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,550
after I'll to correct guesses

123
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,110
you then have up basically 40 thats

124
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,270
so that only the its last that you don't
know

125
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,490
well you for force the

126
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,780
whole entire range to see which ones
actually workout

127
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,650
then you have basically 256 gases you
have to make

128
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,099
then you would have not know if he was

129
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,610
I'll it was including air

130
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,720
being coated out there's the

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,479
private key Cherokee that was then and
tax

132
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,370
than base 32

133
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:19,370
yeah harm

134
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,120
hurty a sorry I

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,120
so a yeah you want you check out

136
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,370
ir so hardcover

137
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,630
sacked so you

138
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,990
money cue track coach everything in the
last %uh time span

139
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,990
so that about you can't just keep
guessing those

140
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,600
her

141
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,390
oh yeah

142
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,899
also you don't wanna update so did you
get the

143
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,130
but for talkie if you get

144
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,269
about the about

145
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,370
second factor cracked than up

146
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,680
usually I with the so does is

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,149
it just for times you I

148
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,420
you don't wanna Justin so after you

149
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,810
also verify password: because

150
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,290
be database update will take sometime

151
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,849
busty might be able I'll whether you got
the

152
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,240
hazard reg for I'm arm

153
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,820
me so you should have

154
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,910
archie factor upon occasion optional 0

155
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,209
I also has amassed that is

156
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,768
one that is horny is hair here

157
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,060
hey yes so

158
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,359
for Twitter a had problems as

159
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,620
always started so right um

160
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,829
so login process I so you have to
repeals

161
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:10,219
username/password second factor which is

162
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,640
are optional if it is and Mabel so what
you do is you look up there using

163
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,779
its naval than you than ask for the
second factor

164
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,050
and you check %uh both

165
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,640
the password said factor otherwise you
just

166
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,339
hassles home so

167
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,339
I yeah II extractor

168
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,040
tell company about this so well I told
them

169
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,029
Brian Thomas gonna do talking shop sets
so

170
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,579
up star star star star company home

171
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,920
this is up what they do all ok

172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,140
well what they do is they do

173
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,230
quiet side crypto that so

174
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,529
all the encryption is done right side
and

175
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,769
the only thing on the servers encrypt
the data so

176
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,920
yeah huh so

177
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,719
up they had a similar misunderstanding
has crept on

178
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,819
home so they have occurred on

179
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,089
a their always saying zero-knowledge

180
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,890
arm they don't want anything to know
about your password

181
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,430
but to do this day use Searcy

182
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,380
but the server has well decides the fact
that you do any

183
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,779
encryption Bay stop password it some

184
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,560
public gee or I indicating corruption

185
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,640
both does happen I'll you know
information to say whether you got

186
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,579
passer correct or not so those are
password hash reports I'll

187
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,649
so butt whipped up past a

188
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,310
SRP um basically

189
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,869
about its password hash up for what in
the Davis

190
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,800
use or authenticating with circuit which

191
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
is are I so bad in order lecture

192
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,930
her so I in AR

193
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,410
well this has nothing to do it guys up
talk about

194
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,100
he circle so I scouts

195
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,029
home so in an audit or a

196
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,220
tripped on they're told to do a elliptic
curve asserting

197
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,350
but you non-existence

198
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,720
or something um there is a you but
they're major problems

199
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,709
I'll so %ah roads Roman

200
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,079
a be GTG 11 hacker

201
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,120
he was trying to do arm well

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,260
hey here but

203
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,329
I she was trying to do I'll

204
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:51,189
incur SRP and about you're going back
and forth and wanna

205
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,459
things a him up with was using

206
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,529
a P&Q but

207
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:02,089
which are two points on her up

208
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,890
but such he was unable to actually get
anything that works

209
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,769
but %uh so I came up with this

210
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:12,970
up so minor things but might

211
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,970
he weird-looking is the

212
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,579
%uh he division the facts but

213
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:23,029
basically since I looked occurs are

214
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,130
on a single group that has a hate crime
um

215
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,589
you can do and basically what you doings

216
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:37,410
up multiplying their inside just support
group so we can do is

217
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,740
up so she being the prime

218
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,250
number her the said sequel herd size

219
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,390
%uh you can view

220
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,939
acts race to you she -2 Maki

221
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:56,640
and that gives you the I'll

222
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,689
modular inverse there

223
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:03,910
so unwanted greatness others shrink
username on

224
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,730
your billion

225
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,140
god's your so are

226
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,100
so the worst I've ever seen I'm so good
talk about said

227
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,610
I had more up and yes so the login
process

228
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,900
is get username and six digit I

229
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,470
site factor 10 I'll it pronger sale

230
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,370
are than 0

231
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,300
a so if they get it right I'll you

232
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,490
reached that the server gives you a
challenge

233
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,060
which is a message in cryptid with your
public G

234
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,160
and your crib did cry Vicky so

235
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,600
what but so this is a real password

236
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,360
hasher quite what that but is being
protected by six digit K

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,850
arm than FB

238
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,930
response is cracked and 11 so

239
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,079
the attack I you guessed the

240
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,830
sixty Japan and so you get a rate
assuming that there is

241
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,630
to you you know awesome -2 us that spot

242
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,060
original you I'm here are her time you

243
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,260
um they originally had no women

244
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,920
for guessing but a so I just what we're
quite

245
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,780
10 dozens psyching so going on yo how

246
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,730
the pen yes sixty-two per over

247
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm our new tomorrow

248
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,990
%uh this is the second factor there's a
password and

249
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,230
he's sector

250
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,300
so sick how a better passer

251
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,640
than its ir use

252
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,319
I think it's up this property are

253
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,089
best um an arrest so

254
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,200
this is just guessing the six digit PIN

255
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,460
I'll take on average three hours but

256
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,520
since I told them this they changed it
to you a

257
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,980
ten-second up rate so you can only do
one every 10 seconds

258
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,000
so %uh now on average

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,700
its 12 dates so after 12 days yet a

260
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,850
has a passcode what they can do %uh a
heart attack

261
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,560
and are

262
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
um there is a problem with this

263
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,410
%uh he since you're guessing every 10
seconds

264
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,730
the legitimate user when they try and go
they're not going to be able to login

265
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,630
he chose out its gonna say wait 10
seconds

266
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,439
and that'll keep saying that for so
dates so you can you go like of ours are

267
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,800
like

268
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,969
up thirty seconds away so that you know
there's

269
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:01,970
20 seconds where they can actually
jumping so

270
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,359
now that you have the pasa ask for what
you do %uh

271
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,719
our crime cracking than once its

272
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,449
%uh once you have the passer I'll

273
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,569
than you up to you

274
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,909
get back and say up to do another 12
days I'll

275
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,939
getting past the factor than

276
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,069
once you're an I you can actually
request or

277
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,409
he I'll second factor G

278
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,590
yes sixty 96 bit up

279
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,809
he and I'm you are

280
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,260
lynching up are

attacker your you well would you like to
%uh

314
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,730
topky the protocol up or

315
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,770
up the home

316
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,500
Cooper but the ones that

arm well I must say doc morrow

321
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,910
if they have rate-limiting than

322
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,640
its probably find like if they walk you
out for a long period of time

323
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,870
early you guess in some no because I
usually with

324
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,909
the six digit I'll and goats site 5

325
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,860
piping a million chance its yet your

326
