1
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,580
yeah

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,629
am over body this is Robert Graham on
network password hashes hashes

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,330
ash it

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,979
so out today to talk about um

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,599
a for small about me

6
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,960
moment I do stuff I'm that make you have
account so the slide presentation will

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,309
be at get have a Cal

8
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:39,599
leader weapons to their um

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,690
when talking about today is a so we all
know if this is right

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,820
this is be out we were crashing

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,480
we get password um like some on the
Internet like

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,610
hacks into big website and dumps

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,699
a million passwords and they're like may
be insulted md5 or something like that

14
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,599
so we go into all still have scattered
on the river

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,890
on we going to crack

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,140
we like to look at this algorithm is all
25 so that's the store and we use

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,830
reported that so we're not talking about
today is

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,729
what with your network we eavesdrop on
the network and we get stuff

19
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,759
and it often looks like this it's the
same algorithm actually

20
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,560
and actually you could in some cases you
can just go in there

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,060
sniffed packets pull out the fields and
pretend that they're assaulted md5

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,869
password

23
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,390
but back to sexy challenge response and
then

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,590
what your look you foresee it the a
child response matches

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,820
the what you see in the packet so

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,850
most what we talked about for password
hacking is

27
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,380
password ups up you hack into download
passions run and three keep you crack

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,250
rock has cat

29
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,420
and we're talking about is we tap into
the network

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,840
we don't pack it's a desk or something
abstract password hashes

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,280
and then run through the Jeep you pass a
cracker um

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,720
and this part though is part that Sony's
be done is that we don't have a lot of

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,510
out rhythms

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,549
in like oh still have scattered on the
river that can

35
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,849
deal with the pass rehash that with your
network and go through that show you

36
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:22,619
with those with those

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,020
I'll algorithms look like um

38
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,680
were talking about some tonight wall she
is

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,310
who does not know while she so while a
sheep is this thing they do every year

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,310
at Def Con

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,930
where they eased up a network and they
disclose

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,709
clear text passwords so when people log
on like pop to your FTP or Telnet

43
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,819
and disclose in the clear without
encryption whatsoever the password

44
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,079
the pop them up on the screen at that
cut and Israel are fun because you see

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,319
oftentimes see people there that are
very well known in the community

46
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,359
who have done something really stupid
disclose the password so what i'm

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,569
talking about here though it's over
walls to 2.0

48
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,099
I'll wear something similar might go on
where we look at the encrypt it passed

49
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,179
through exchanges

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,060
where the pass was not clear text but
which we can run through a

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,390
a password cracker and quickly get the
original password

52
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,890
so you might find someone famous in the
community very well known for security

53
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,260
but whose password turns out to be a
very weak password easley crackle

54
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,640
up

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,649
so when I log onto a computer like Mike

56
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,900
gmail or I a website

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,069
or might chat session

58
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:46,429
um how does that actually work and
there's four ways

59
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,000
one which is the first one which at the
cleartext one

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,519
where just the senate you using a pastor
in clear text you when he's dropping on

61
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,909
the network and then discover it

62
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,200
which is the wall she play doing things
another one is where you put the

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,849
connection

64
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,950
with SSL that's how we mostly log on
today I logged on to Twitter

65
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,619
is clear Texas the occasion but it goes
over SSL connection so that

66
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,280
no one can use drop on that unless they
have course happy eso connection with

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,580
that

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,509
look really not what the stock is about
on acting as a cell

69
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:24,750
the third way is crypto where I do those
count response is where I

70
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,400
where the machine where use crypto to
hide the passwords don't see it without

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,919
having

72
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,270
crockett national the stock is about

73
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,650
is also a fourth way a doing it which

74
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,870
on the talk about the N I'll their ways

75
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,900
exchange you pass without using SSL but
in a way that

76
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,489
can't be cracked either

77
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,400
so here's a typical password
authentication audrey has been around

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,198
for decades

79
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,290
I was called tap in Chap means challenge
response protocol

80
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,139
and that's weird me connect to a server
get sent to a string

81
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,800
you then hash that string with your
passwords in the back the route response

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,280
back to the missing

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
and simply that mp5 a child what's the
password

84
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,888
and the server that does the same
calculation South

85
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,930
compare whether those two are the same
and then

86
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,680
a lets you login and by hash

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,810
it off I often mean more than just md5
like this the H Matt algorithm which

88
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,470
took more

89
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,530
passes in the complicated way to make
cryptanalysis more difficult

90
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,770
but we're talking about propel password
cracking

91
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,530
which is brute force a dictionary tax we
real hear about the exact details above

92
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:38,869
the

93
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,300
a protocol are a mean the hashing
algorithm

94
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,860
the weather is using H Mac which is much
more secure descriptor now says

95
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,620
techniques milk extract it we're never
doing for noel says

96
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,759
do reports that were cracking

97
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,350
up so here's an example here's the
cleartext way for small spot three

98
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,819
which protocol that's older than many of
us you guys

99
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,660
and here's how I might log on I might
wildlife user Rob

100
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,220
okay password are is a strong password
there random here

101
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,470
and then it says okay you're logged on
you got one message waiting

102
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,319
so pop 3 supports a more secure method
called a pop

103
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,240
um and is the server supports that the
first okay message I get when I connect

104
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,850
be the the TCP connection in those

105
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,550
a rap get sick with a random string

106
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,300
and most the time that string consisting
a timestamp followed by

107
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,500
like the domain is is the standard
technique

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,050
and the timestamps always increasing so
that a

109
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,060
yet replicate the same hash over and
over

110
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,680
and I log on now I take by a logo for
use him again a Papa Rob

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,710
then I md5 past

112
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,080
that sounds during lost my password and
then the last logon

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,690
so that's how pop 3 solve that problem

114
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,699
but for love early Internet Protocol we
didn't really have any good solution for

115
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,800
in a cryptid

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,330
I'll connection away one

117
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,750
maginnis less osaka is about as I can I
could take that string

118
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,960
that child responds to parse terrible

119
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,099
um and put those into a password cracker
I can pretend that one is the salt

120
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:31,300
what is the password Iran perhaps get
and ask that can actually

121
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,830
her

122
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,789
I am so I am

123
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,620
support that help up three they add that
that a public sent into it

124
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,780
but for La early Internet Protocol they
don't really have any solution

125
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,818
SMTP didn't have any

126
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,069
login because back when it with SMTP was
graded there was no need to authenticate

127
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:55,509
user

128
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,379
because you works change the email on
was get your user that cared about

129
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,069
because

130
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:05,030
all the emails going to its final
destination and then spammer started

131
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,619
exporting servers that would forward the
email that people say well now we need

132
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,560
user authentication to make sure you're
allowed to use the mail server

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,770
so what they came up with was a solution
for all these particles

134
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,258
and that's called saddle as yes it's
simple application security layer

135
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,530
but it's just the pluggable cryptosystem

136
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,258
that plug into all these particles so
whether you're using pop three-year I

137
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,069
mapper

138
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,680
SM ppl that or Irish senior Jaber

139
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,189
we might be in CES yen a

140
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,779
UNC's protocol for remote screen grab
this the end

141
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,370
does a version control source code

142
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,560
jabar's a chat protocol

143
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,079
a all these particles now have Sasa was
one other options

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,680
they also might have their own
authentication techniques but saddled

145
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,189
not

146
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:03,000
what's havel gives you is knowledge is a
plugin dollars protocols

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,570
allows trip to our girls reply again

148
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,320
so one algorithm is called anonymous
which just means

149
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,930
not indication another algorithm were to
alter the plane and login

150
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,649
which are both just clear text passwords
one puts both

151
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,660
using a password on the same a

152
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,339
together and the other one with what
separate lines those really did this

153
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,310
both plain text

154
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,839
loggins and then

155
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,980
the other algorithms the next line are
all these child response things like the

156
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,089
MT 51

157
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,180
a digestion defies the same one like a
pop

158
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,160
NTLM as Microsoft specific child
response protocol

159
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
which read: talk about a lot more
because everywhere Microsoft world

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
up Graham md5 s Graham char1 are

161
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,570
variations on the same sort of theme
tell boss with additional things

162
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,910
the reason we need to have this is
because these different algorithms

163
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,350
impose different requirements on the
server

164
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,800
so with I just md5 it I'm doing the
calculation other challenge plus the

165
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,790
password

166
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,319
that means the server needs to store the
cleartext password that's a bad thing

167
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
as we all know no passer crack in world

168
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,839
is Sir Richard store passwords with
assaulted

169
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,100
addition they shoulda have to pass
through the server store with assault

170
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,110
and use an hour with Mike PKD up to

171
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,410
which a will rehash it Mike a thousand
times

172
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,029
and that's the secure way we know the
password should be storage servers

173
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,320
left with this s Graham saw one s Graham
a

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,050
md5 does is it's just the same

175
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,910
a child response password algorithm but
with the fact that you now are doing

176
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,000
recognized with that the storm passes
directly on the server

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,250
and there's also a bunch other things
that we can't crack

178
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,100
um at one time passers that we have a
security token or something held

179
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,970
current password is that allowed to log
on you can log on with that

180
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,160
and that I can grab you the network
packets but yet

181
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,449
crockett you ending useful with it

182
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,660
savell floods in the many protocols and
then there's this

183
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,600
GSS API also clubs in saddle

184
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,630
and the whole GSS API thing we're gonna
see that and

185
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,930
in protocols has his own plugin
architecture

186
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,410
so those are the main things we talk
about settles night say hey I'm doing

187
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,510
I met for about doing this as cramps are
one login or I'm doing

188
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,930
DNC I'm doing digestive 5 login

189
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,310
for me St and Bob do not miss thats
house all

190
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,819
all these things a plugin to each other

191
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,980
so here's pop three again where I'm
doing

192
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,230
of grand md5 over business adult

193
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,240
and its a base64 encoded grain

194
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,940
that server that what means research

195
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,050
and a town 3 that

196
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,300
or and I my house with everything

197
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,439
that the bases before go to string

198
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,550
with industry by the way is the username
plus the response to the

199
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,729
to challenge

200
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,510
or might do of Graham Shaw 17 of Graham

201
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,800
md5 and again it's the same thing

202
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,569
so I want longer so the screen

203
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,010
a or about your going to look he

204
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,980
Microsoft Exchange Server using popular
at work Microsoft user

205
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,889
and he'll am which has a more
complicated thing going back

206
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,389
or doing luck is all creepy is all

207
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,700
Cody here in base64 because and he loves
a binary

208
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,070
a thing but a

209
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,570
upward tech base protocol all that the
100

210
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,190
for were in C&D line I'll

211
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,010
in other protocols so we're gonna I'm

212
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,569
not really is too much time on exactly
is happening right here

213
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,839
if our to base64 decode that that one
mystery

214
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,160
look like like the slogans during

215
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,870
old what user I was before Cup the first
challenge back

216
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,170
a to here's your Gmail login

217
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,540
so i connect to tell netted yesterday

218
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,130
SMTP here two years ago SMTP gmail dot
com

219
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,800
report by the G-seven so as we all know
SMTP normally runs report

220
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,250
25 but there are these other ports open

221
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,019
design for things like this users too
many

222
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,660
email the the system

223
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,420
and so I tell it to the sport and we see
some interesting things here

224
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,880
um so I say hello who and

225
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,279
help to come back no yes get abilities

226
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,660
and so do things as also tells me all
the authentication technique that

227
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,750
supports and settle

228
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,529
it tells me I can do this log in a plane
to clear thats

229
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,199
or um also sports is own custom
extensions

230
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,660
cells on plugin: protocol a algorithms

231
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,769
just using 00 or what to do

232
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,029
in and I have no idea what way right ok
these are all supported by the way

233
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,850
because Google does this outsourced
email system gmail years

234
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,529
at who uses the outsource Google Gmail
Corp other

235
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,980
corporate headquarters

236
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,050
a Google s yeah so I am

237
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,569
yes the whole system to lapse never on
authentication is all plugs in

238
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,860
that although out quite quite up

239
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,899
for from

240
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,190
so why did was okay was promptly

241
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,600
the love

242
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,459
argues that login and told me that no I
could use that

243
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,589
because I had to do the star you less
for

244
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,350
so it's got the plaintext log in clear
text login

245
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,630
available the only if by do

246
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,589
US first star SSL connection

247
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,230
are ya who does the same thing those
interesting it didn't advertise would

248
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,920
soften

249
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,399
basement start just I'll you start

250
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,120
you let first and the reason for that is

251
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,180
is that once you start you start he'll
that

252
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,469
your cell next you

253
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,620
your restarted rock so

254
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,360
Yahoo only tells you which
authentication techniques that supports

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,019
only after that you done the SSL

256
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,310
and then a ghetto issue this case is yet
yeah I'd

257
00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,160
like that or

258
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,769
so here's another example miss cases I'm
that poor know the way to grab

259
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,910
email the server I'm again the server
tells us hey

260
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,290
I don't get Billy command it'll be okay
your

261
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,560
bill I Rob for

262
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,170
you

263
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,180
%uh and those are the three
authentication techniques it supports

264
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,930
and here's an example up doing is the
other case plane and Bennett

265
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,829
help when okay I love login

266
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:33,979
so let's talk Mon but the SCRAM a
technique

267
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,310
which is one the ones that plugs into a
lot these protocols

268
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,849
so as I said before up just doing the

269
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,490
the brought challenge response mp5 means
server has to know the password

270
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,560
with gramm the it the server doesn't

271
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,689
serrano's the password hashes hashed
thousand times

272
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,800
with PKD up to and I'll

273
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,779
has a saw and so what's Graham does the
reports that

274
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,349
the client nets and it says 'em

275
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,438
the user name is user in this case
calabash

276
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,160
Rob hear something and use a random
string

277
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,510
and the circles back and says okay I
think the industry has more RAM

278
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,309
here I'll and by the way this all

279
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:22,819
that all by

280
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,159
generation four thousand times rehashing
the password

281
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,000
um so that's why I've that's what I've
done to the password

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,590
and but why waste so

283
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,668
so now service call me how house toward

284
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:44,330
after database the population using the
hashed passwords like you first as I

285
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,549
take the password

286
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,549
hasher was so i won and then

287
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:54,299
I do the replica populations in order to
improve the server that I don't password

288
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,639
now with this transaction I now can
store the pastors

289
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,809
Requiem the server and a

290
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:06,899
not little the way way with with them 5

291
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,669
arm and here's how it might appear so
let's say I'm I'm doing XO

292
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,929
you gather for chap protocol

293
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:18,500
I am here's why start the client %uh
start the connection

294
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,600
a again lead to the strains

295
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,199
in one cell

296
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,270
usually million are that

297
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,080
their basic were coated yet that's
because it usually might have a

298
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,309
utf8 pass for carrot this binary

299
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,840
the protocols can support just been a
basic one code again

300
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,230
so he basically for peco's history

301
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,549
have a protocol I'm a little match

302
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,129
the Spurs here

303
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,110
so a village Abers XML protocol so you
can see how things like this plugin

304
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,549
the saddle plug in system works no
matter what kinda protocol you have this

305
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:01,809
case is XML

306
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:08,710
and just loved writing yeah

307
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,620
I had this twice your don't know why

308
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,840
okay so this heart

309
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,120
my screen to so this is an held that
message

310
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,330
and this is held up log in

311
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,070
and what we see here actually is hoop
who your nose for Brause

312
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,460
okay so her Ross is

313
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,210
was developed in long time ago by MIT

314
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,030
and the ideas for us is the only login
wants to login server

315
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,480
and then from then on with an
organization a

316
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,280
that server controls your login
everything else

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,399
so that's class why has a thing here out

318
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,799
message esse guys I'm or battle system

319
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,900
is that a her boss plugged into that but
instead

320
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,559
up the pass through the exchanges you
get this ticket

321
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,850
from the login server that allows you to
log and everything else

322
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,980
so you arrive at work in the morning you
log on for Microsoft

323
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,309
Active Directory domain um NASCAR rush
exchange

324
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:20,530
and then when you log into your email to
the corporate website to also this up

325
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,100
within the corporation you're not
actually ever given your password ever

326
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,059
again

327
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,129
he's other servers they never know your
password they just are

328
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,360
record tickets so here's nelda

329
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,610
exchange up where I see it

330
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,789
here with wires are her were that

331
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:42,980
that her brother exchange driving ticket
and then here's the %uh that protocol

332
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,120
and just that were

333
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,260
go cool said

334
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:59,260
yet and yet

335
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,030
so in this login up here crack

336
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,750
but in other cases or exchanges what's
going on there something that I can

337
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,409
crack into

338
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,500
so a lot of people know that curb ross
is a sticky granting system

339
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,080
that a you log in once the tickets are
sent back and forth to

340
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,658
login every servant corporation well I
have doc risks or to skip how the

341
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,450
herb ross authentication works in the
first place your that first login

342
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,789
you log in her bra server

343
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:38,020
and the way it's done is it's not a pass
for caching system

344
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,990
instead the first FBS someone into the
server

345
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,140
and the service is ok and look up Robin
in the database

346
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,270
heroes password is blah or maybe rose
password hash and that's fine too

347
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,460
I'm I can feel them pass

348
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,809
and then I'm going to use that password
to encrypt the message back to rob

349
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,149
that has all that ticket information

350
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,210
so it's used pork ribs

351
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,570
and the and this is that message now if

352
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,789
I don't know the password or the server
doesn't know the password

353
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:17,179
I can't jump that message de que
continue on with with with herb ross

354
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:21,650
and this prize mutual authentication
technique does it proved to me that the

355
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,900
server knows my password

356
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,450
without me having to disclose the server
password is so while server as you set

357
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,360
them up

358
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,539
where wherever password exchange to use
and servicers is OK

359
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:36,260
does action password does not actually
rude serving what's up to

360
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,090
like hostile WiFi access points

361
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,480
so that sucker rod work and

362
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,929
because this message that sent back has
a well-known format

363
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,179
it should be pretty easy to actually
crack

364
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,090
and there's lotsa different herb ross
course plugins again

365
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,678
always for all these things or plug-ins
so the courage to think Asian supports

366
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,610
for example

367
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,039
using md5 hash password and then Dez

368
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,370
to diplomat or you saw 12 hash the
password and use

369
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,049
a yes to get the message or use mp4 to
hatch the password

370
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:17,210
to a Microsoft you sorry to have to pass
word up and then you'd like RC

371
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,559
for in order to curb message so

372
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,899
arrest had about 20 audible algorithms

373
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,500
but the upside is that well we can't
grab all the things like this

374
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,860
that just passed tickets around and
crack those passwords

375
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,030
from was if we see the initial corrupt
chains we can

376
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,190
is that for cracking system

377
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,490
up use the same sort of thing with perot
up

378
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,919
is plugging into a different protocol
here this is Microsoft SMB protocol

379
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,080
file-sharing protocol that me micro
article

380
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,090
or 5 here we were log into a file server

381
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,230
and again we're seeing how S&P

382
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,669
or and held up are completely different
protocols

383
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,770
but once we get done well Ruby Apple

384
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,279
yeah I that point is all the same format

385
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,840
and this is some it's really useful for
from forgetting the slings

386
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,199
if I want to write a program the
automatic rebel this hashing information

387
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,299
I don't actually have to do as much work
as I originally thought

388
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,070
because I want to park what or

389
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,879
this 1 and yup

390
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,820
parser or my oh that parser or

391
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,928
my jabber parser and so on

392
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,150
um but as much before for the

393
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,710
her bra stuff were skipping the login
stuff that was a seagram's

394
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,559
but here's the same thing where message
in the log in

395
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,799
Microsoft primary login portal actually
that's used most time isn't

396
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,840
herb ross 1 but is the end-to-end E

397
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,730
which has won this very well known its
decades-old by now

398
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,880
um again it is plugged going your

399
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,830
the work

400
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,439
around and

401
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,510
Haseeno password plus

402
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,870
blue challenge on this case are hatching
the password hash because

403
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:31,870
when the store is a mess a that's rude
as int4 hash

404
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,850
so that's a good discussion ok what's
going on for like protocols

405
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,870
but there's a lot other stuff doesn't
quite fit

406
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,370
that mall a who hear her to the no I P
incident

407
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,408
a few weeks ago so Microsoft hijacked

408
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,980
this company this company is providing
dynamic dns which means that your laptop

409
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,010
a car on the network right now my laptop
go to know why PNC

410
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,580
a my current IP address for this domain
name is this

411
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,610
yes by laptop was around people on the
internet

412
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,668
still access my laptop via that the main
even that my IP address changes

413
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,770
than empty nest is used for home people
whose providers change your IP address

414
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,400
on a constant basis

415
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,309
and for things like mobile device

416
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:23,139
so a is also used by botnets so
Microsoft hijacked that the main

417
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,340
went to court got a court order saying
give us that the main

418
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,820
and then which is a a million a

419
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,220
don't be a million customers and now
suddenly went no I P sorry

420
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,340
being an Microsoft you all this dynamic
dns

421
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,899
and Microsoft server still down about
%uh surgery BN's

422
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,900
had a bad thing but

423
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,809
so I looked into how they do their
authentication how they do that dynamic

424
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:52,450
a how my laptop would register a dynamic
name

425
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,820
and I originally thought it was going to
be via DNS DNS has that dynamic DNS

426
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,990
functionality built into it

427
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,240
and the way it works is on the DNS query

428
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,590
and that query the campaign to record
when

429
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:13,590
heart you

430
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,590
K

431
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,320
your up

432
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,149
and again it's very simple md5
straightforward authentication

433
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,080
I'll that's how I thought that know what
you would work in S

434
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,270
posed a problem because um Microsoft
doesn't have any look past took

435
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,389
ever validate what those patrons are the
hassle accepts

436
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,460
that ended up this rainy one

437
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,860
so up by the way in that DNS thing

438
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,870
again as possible crypto so even that
was 25 in that example

439
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,559
you can use all 10 me was when you got
this

440
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,899
yes thing as 0 which can then be all
these other possible things like

441
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,889
again T-lam or Ross

442
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,419
so whenever it is password field job we
which costs the same pattern over and

443
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:14,010
over

444
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,850
but there's this huggable curves are
possible authentication system that

445
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,149
matter something else I've already done

446
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:26,760
so that's why I thought that no I P was
using and as it turns out was

447
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,350
when used although I P H on your on your
laptop

448
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,029
I'll its end clarissa when you change
your IP address

449
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,179
said or like that or

450
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,750
here yet yo

451
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,590
long work

452
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,120
watson et Bay 64 Coast ring

453
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,039
clear text so

454
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,750
again we're back to like the stock is
supposed to be about cracking password

455
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,549
hashes and and robust script up

456
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:04,629
authentication but no one week we look
into things off we just seen it was

457
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,669
worker so yes this was a real

458
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,190
got great Rob

459
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,120
agree with the Y P and

460
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,340
that's my real museum in past where they
chose

461
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,678
because the course is a demo

462
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,029
it should be a thing was celebration Yes
No

463
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,090
it

464
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,340
so it's another case to study this is
kinda interesting a

465
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,870
Vic Kohring nope their windows becoming
so

466
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,279
one other ways that the cooling system
works but that point might

467
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:47,960
that's how a transactions are verified
how do because agreed

468
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,090
so if I'm a big boy minor I'm gonna have
a lot to working machines

469
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,840
their office furiously a money back ones

470
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,908
arm and I need to post by latest results
back to up my nipple

471
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:05,240
these days people don't mind the clothes
themselves instead they work with the

472
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,260
pool

473
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,020
that takes the collective effort if they
went together and then presents that as

474
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,179
because money

475
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,190
that's because of your mind by yourself

476
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,779
it would take a thousand years to get
one day going so instead you

477
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:22,049
you work with 12,000 people and that
it's only a month

478
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:26,879
to get a partial but going

479
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,020
so here's a minor might look like
subtotal money

480
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,080
how might be using homered

481
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,649
or your he said

482
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,830
as custom chip working away generating

483
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,389
0 a third have a billion I

484
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,039
hashes per second because of the basin
hatching it's like password hashing but

485
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,429
its a different

486
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:55,600
so you still see working away money
going my generate

487
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,178
0 now brower

488
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:02,570
which that very much actually its
affiliates who aren't going to go to

489
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,360
pick one per hour

490
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,500
I'm anti-slip disconnection so how does
he authenticate

491
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,500
and again we see a.m.

492
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,050
a pick up

493
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:25,810
the wrong string year yeah

494
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,940
so those a stir in a similar transaction
if

495
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,240
if I had the right thing here i decoded
it

496
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,520
and eat it too so it might work with
woodworker one and the password

497
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,840
cortex a 64 encoded again the same sort
of thing but their text

498
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,730
these big win money support two
different versions the protocol

499
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,970
that was the first verse the second
version 10

500
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,310
a j-son document and just again so

501
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,040
you me clear one thing about this

502
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,440
though is that that's not actually in
secure because what

503
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,820
these big point mining pools do is they
have one using password:

504
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,300
for a for your

505
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,250
your main account and then assigns
another using a password for each

506
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:18,070
worker so if a workers comp my eyes it
doesn't compromise your entire cow

507
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,540
and if workers compromised there's not
much they can do with your account other

508
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,300
than summit bad workshops

509
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,950
yeah

510
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,960
and most fools don't even care yeah all
they care about who I do I get credit

511
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,480
so so he must clear taxes actually kinda
works

512
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,820
your no one knows my main account name
was

513
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,139
I'll it the only other worker counting

514
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,570
and mention this because that

515
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,610
Chris Paul can actually apply to a lot
of protocols an example is set

516
00:32:53,610 --> 00:33:00,000
Sep is the simple session repeated

517
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,070
had his truck the book which is the ice
get more

518
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,750
we have a gun %uh the wrong direction
yes which it says Initiation Protocol

519
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,680
I'll and it did for making phone calls

520
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,970
across the unit was the right people
call me and all our phones come with

521
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,860
ship so

522
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,300
for Android and iPhone some good as a
SIP account we can actually start dying

523
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,250
without actually any

524
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,100
special software wells a

525
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,389
the Super the protocols are this session
and anarchy p

526
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,510
is the real time protocol I think I'm

527
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,110
that carries the day the voice so simple
only about started phone call

528
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,169
other stuff panel that will draft which
invoice its

529
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,470
often issues a done deal over you TP but
uses HTP like Oracle

530
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,230
so how does that but then again it so

531
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,540
and yes that's minutes into a plugin
stuff as the other particles do

532
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,070
%uh HTTP doesn't use as a lot south but
it

533
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,210
it effectively does use a lot same
algorithm

534
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:05,440
so here we're seeing the standard-issue
protocol does again the md5 exchange

535
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,090
where they send

536
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:13,370
up town go

537
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:18,290
works in

538
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,949
the hatch the town what's the password
so thing is with said

539
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,428
if you're making a phone call or his
public network here conference

540
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,010
I can grab your Session Initiation

541
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,750
well you register year your

542
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,980
yeah minute spitting out

543
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,800
a packet to the SIP server so if you're
running a sip on your phone

544
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,140
your costly talk in the network giving
up

545
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,918
password hash that in another cracker
and

546
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,199
that readings I bring this up that big
point example

547
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,930
because set sorus really should have
that that worker concept

548
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,230
aware I've got one account but

549
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,210
Sep information that would in here %uh
should be like per phone

550
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,430
so the only thing you can do pick up my
eyes this cup might just my phones

551
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,850
connection to my September

552
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:17,850
not mine parce pick out so yeah so

553
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,920
phone require something simple like I
log onto maybe a account

554
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,060
answers okay your phone were actually a
QR code

555
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,470
then you take a picture that and that's
your thing case information for your

556
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,100
phone

557
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,920
and by the way as me completely
randomized password so that when these

558
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,940
are cracking this

559
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,850
cracking happens because you doing
dictionary tax that by sign a random

560
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,910
tolley long random stranger phone

561
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:48,910
will never be trackable and the sleeper
say so suddenly

562
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,000
ATP for a moment a HTTP support
suffocation within the header

563
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,480
most the time these days we log on to
the server

564
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,890
were logging on via stuff going within
the

565
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,220
the you are I R host information this
then

566
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,540
up to the SSL just look beyond normal
form

567
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,730
we'll ever use actual HTTP
authentication

568
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,180
when we get those annoying pop-up box a
with the realm is that

569
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,200
it that thats this other caisson

570
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,660
as usual mentioning this because a

571
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,670
there was the case with we've was a

572
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,140
the notorious internet troll broken AT&T

573
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,680
as they broke into because AT&T it
published the information

574
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,859
a bunch of all love all the early iPad
account holders

575
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,790
policy all the IP addresses on the
internet and North axis that you need

576
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,930
you need to set your script have the use
registering

577
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:51,149
say it was an iPad and and and looking
at is all that confirmation

578
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,470
I'm so that's not the case I

579
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,240
my repeat that because Europe lawyers in
the

580
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,089
the judges and the juries think that
well here changes

581
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,950
is I just moved his iPad use rate
history

582
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:10,359
network must be some sort of
authentication technique but it's not

583
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,040
to ATP define is his better

584
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,230
the way it works to connect to web site
the URL

585
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:24,430
misses you have access to it and by the
way I support

586
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,870
up I yet

587
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:34,870
up year-round well

588
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,840
there

589
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,310
up so 0

590
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,740
so they said okay you here

591
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,649
well

592
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,940
out that 0

593
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,980
your

594
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,820
so again is very credible stuff

595
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,930
um and here's the exact algorithm oh
please

596
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:16,390
how is it that way using row

597
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,549
and then that value yeah

598
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,920
other value here met year 0

599
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,250
0

600
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,930
all

601
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,930
loss

602
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,230
so a that we're trained md5

603
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,830
digest a version here's the same sort of
thing

604
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,299
yes really small sorry about that

605
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,590
this you

606
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,810
here Europe or I wasn't held Apple

607
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,020
SMB although Microsoft particles

608
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,860
a yet here to blow it up you can see the
cell

609
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:12,860
up your E

610
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:21,310
and all the other information

611
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,680
um again a

612
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,839
we see it there's the end-to-end
directly but there's also Jesus API

613
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,330
work and do things like herb ross there
as well

614
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,569
was interesting about this by the way is
I'll

615
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,010
for the prevailing Microsoft techniques
%uh Dante Lam

616
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,540
and Microsoft's version herb ross

617
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,390
because it supported now Internet
Explorer expect also chrome

618
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,540
and Mozilla and support a back-end

619
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,630
like on a patchy plugins stuff so

620
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,450
this Microsoft way above indicate things
is pervasive it's everywhere

621
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:03,950
even in unit system that you think are
hostile a Microsoft

622
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,359
having people here's organization up
Microsoft Active Directory domain

623
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,370
is the settled authentication for the
whole networks

624
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,859
so fun ought because alive universities
are very

625
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,120
unit centric but when you log on to your
sole heiress machine with your account

626
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,700
is actually going to acted directly to
Microsoft server

627
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,950
II I find that really amusing because

628
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:32,060
allow the students really hate Microsoft
in love you next but they still haven't

629
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,660
your Microsoft

630
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,680
just talk about Microsoft more so
Microsoft has this

631
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,819
RPC this remote communication technique
also

632
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,170
wesun messages back in force the

633
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,370
XML messages

634
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,650
um and so you support saddle

635
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,660
and their own authentication mechanisms
all that plug in stuff I talked about

636
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,940
before all supplies

637
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,480
this here's a SOAP request dust-up

638
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,480
for all I'll year

639
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:24,270
yeah all

640
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,049
so

641
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:36,710
we've seen so away so when year-long of
your Xboxes

642
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,619
them this is the sort of thing haitians
happen your list love you like your game

643
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,660
and sex was going across is this or to
request

644
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,170
though these days it's all been SSL
encrypt it now so you can see the more

645
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,539
but I'm imperious crackles only happens
with the

646
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:56,380
the SSL who here uses BNC

647
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,260
so and of you might be using

648
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,460
not really be aware because I you've got
Mac books and stuff use VNC for your

649
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,480
home screen grabbing

650
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,910
so the NC has Israel

651
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,098
its almost two decades old um

652
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:17,609
and over the years has had various
authentication schemes

653
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:21,140
and eventually got down to a

654
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,009
number twenty there which is just that
yes that

655
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,150
so yes he supports as well as well

656
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,200
it also has its own and father Asian

657
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,118
out on I'll have to resort vacation any

658
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,980
was really lame thing a

659
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,210
where was just it was a username was
just

660
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,160
just passer login and again you
connected

661
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,859
the see password on the login

662
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:57,269
in

663
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:01,470
and so is no protocol OSPF

664
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,609
OSPF is the protocol that riders use

665
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:08,119
talk to each other I is using md5

666
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,660
any five passer plus all the contents I
am

667
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,038
year is BGP et/pt cheaper also

668
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,740
its how all the the backbone routers
know about each other Nova

669
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,098
rouse matter-of-fact me great each other

670
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:27,740
there's no feature in BGP provocation

671
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,558
so what they did was the add a feature
the

672
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,319
you sport the five up

673
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:38,359
he should be today trip all TCP packets

674
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,269
pretty much just for BGP I'm let's talk
about radius

675
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:46,868
reduces the server when I log on where

676
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:50,890
way it and enterprise for register

677
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,558
that what's up a

678
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,660
Esparza budget any we miller won when

679
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,839
you easily hackable a

680
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,970
up mocks the most part now that'll
happen says

681
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:13,240
just friends the but eat with plugins

682
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,200
here's how it works I'm at my hotel I
said that with our

683
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,750
log on to the east net there I have tea
you a 02

684
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,019
11x authentication to the Ethernet and
it works I seventy

685
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:30,109
I seventy happy that for way wrong

686
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:34,078
yet no your and with me

687
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,609
that go

688
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:43,390
with md5 again but here's what the
switch

689
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,690
sends to the RADIUS server

690
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,950
it takes you rate protocol

691
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:56,950
you right though

692
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:04,140
go one

693
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,609
from switch to the RADIUS server

694
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:11,980
'em

695
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,430
so PPP is a all protocol that went over
modems

696
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,930
and it has the same md5 charge response

697
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,180
the side but PPP over TCP nasa VPN
technique

698
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,169
or or PPP over Ethernet which is now you
might log on to your ISP

699
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,210
it has all the same tell

700
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:36,910
I'm E what them I'm

701
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,589
so VPN are often very hackable so if
you're if you're

702
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:45,240
look at conference here um eavesdropping
on people's protocols

703
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,299
you might find it people are so sleepy
PPTP

704
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:52,480
and the using a cell response hack
easily

705
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,400
me crack or in which is especially easy

706
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,069
crack see also but

707
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:03,599
World of Warcraft how do they do I think
Asian with a great people are playing

708
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,529
World of Warcraft

709
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:09,230
conference I get back into their
accounts will use this lesser known for

710
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,609
a call call secure remote

711
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:15,230
ago and really kinda cool it does the
same

712
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,339
diffie-hellman our essay exchange where
you generate primes

713
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:22,400
and then you change the prize by math

714
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,059
but mixes in the password and this those
addition to the six changes

715
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:30,380
that in technically it's all in the
clear nothing's being

716
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,910
purpose I can see what's going on but
yet because

717
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,740
is that it's that public-private key
exchange thing

718
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,479
I'm I can't crockett so it's not as a
song corruption

719
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,990
those using similar algorithm yellow

720
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:50,700
but a the clear yeah racket katmandu

721
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,109
missus actual people everywhere should
be using something like this

722
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:57,779
and now all that crack a pollster

723
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:02,859
a by the way if you've got a large
capture files you want to extract them

724
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:06,509
you can use these are go get
presentation for the exact details on

725
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:08,839
how to do that

726
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,819
also by the way this is perking up there
for Windows call Cain Abel

727
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:17,038
and it has a point wrapping up for them
report budget particles

728
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,390
so about 30 per also my presentation it
supports

729
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,420
and what he's up on the on the network
rebels hashes and that has

730
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,579
will sup is really slow because now I G

731
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:31,880
you but it's preschool

732
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,759
so that was it that was what that was
about was

733
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:39,450
it's not about up we're no

734
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,759
for that RP were crap about

735
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:46,339
always production house everywhere
particle use

736
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:50,170
eased up on this network here yet a
little wall sheathing going with got so

737
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,630
many people's asses

738
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,970
run through a cracker they're using weak
passwords will get the password

739
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,180
any questions

740
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,379
here's our sample question about what
MySQL use late

741
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,930
general use plain text sample question

742
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:11,460
see things

743
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,630
question

744
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,789
at universal plugin

745
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:23,210
thanks certainly is you get this sim
universal shame likes asl

746
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,259
how do you avoid in order to provide
that universality

747
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:31,930
how do you avoid having to store
password in the clear on your server

748
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,109
last choice you have to make is often
done with the configuration option

749
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:38,308
where you configure your back in Surrey
say

750
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm restore these hashed passwords so
therefore use Graham

751
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,250
and not md5 authentication so

752
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,589
mostly services had aspiration option

753
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:52,220
if you say I want twenty-five indication
that is that okay now all your passing

754
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:59,089
records

755
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:00,750
get I guess that's it I guess it's time
for lunch
