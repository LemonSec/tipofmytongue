1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,030
a a seat on earth up various

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,280
years about

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,070
well I resisting workers are being
furloughed

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,260

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,240
more where you go outside up

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,479
so bases inside our houses message

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,690
up so time across your

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,730
forces but ignore

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,589
he had or however

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,970
or up site

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,489
per course stationary morrow et cetera

12
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:52,669
obviously you overpasses are

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,710
pasa yes your passage

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,320
crack festival %uh sensor

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,909
parents servers store the up

16
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,289
also over you I was so

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,510
84 absurd Shire

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,369
that out that was actually use this year
has passed and his load on the table

19
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,650
and info pass I'll jails is

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,920
up reverse the roles of both the same

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,539
points coverage was americans are

22
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,649
fourth there's no

23
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:36,490
talks there is up crash at for to of
course it

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,820
I'll John Arthur

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,839
although this sup I'll

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,939
first we're gonna be minimising very
soon up there

27
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,898
to our those up move overcast

28
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,499
okays obviously this is a hash table is
structured

29
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:01,420
where out perfect for me is that there
are no

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,619
solutions so basically

31
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,649
you do you know who they are pro that
you have to generous heart function such

32
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:09,240
that

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,110
is masking GV past be able without
inclusions

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,370
out minimal means that there are

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,750
so he floss up

36

so up and

71
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,790
so ever substances to out but earth

72
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,560
0

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720

so remove those I I was having a

81
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,260
the rumors are you up the control this

82
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,599
I don't actually know that I'll for
never ministry

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,080
there and evidence 0

84
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,300
so you have

85
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,940
those percentages suffered through so

86
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,139
this is how the good this phase is there
for

87
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,700
as a sis up

88
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:48,110
for so

89
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,580
minimal perfect hash functions as a
senator

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,849
Press actions place others

91
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,180

I was his number accessories for Pocket

93
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,510

you have a no more others but

95
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,320
three or four so you have a

96
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,140
and all those own pockets a just you

97
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,680

the bus that use or abuse

99
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,590
same process were spotted earth that

100
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,190
you have and will open it is 13 over

101
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,870
a take although its members

102

times looking over

105
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,138
or so owner so Massimo in cities

106
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,470

110
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,669
up bad each

111
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,729
puppets a users or to Everett you store

112
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,400
those cash number up he functions

113
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,530
I is a problem you have a truck

114
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,179
it up for understanding and

115
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,470
current basically is oh you

116
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,060
fit and good processed into

117
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,630
so a

118
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,680
is the so

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,940
easy to use %uh poppers are

120
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,700
up up

121
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,800
included as the borrower so is this the

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,450
first it first half an hour pass rush to
get it right

123
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,710
over restore actually nothing

124
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,270
that it was the first quarter the store

125
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,140
a single though 0 up faces I was

126
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,630
through for events you know

127
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,760
up basically you up

128
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,430
whiners and see if that is true and

129
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,469
boss s had basically

130
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:21,830
you story process sister

131
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,270
assorted was numbers the server

132
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,460
as old-style riches their

133
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,949
for I'll see actually both

134
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,240
so one of the things you say over

135
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,860
function for you there uppers

136

139
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,329
the reason why I do this is one brother

144
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,530
hazard bridge so so so really what
muriel password

145
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,220
%uh me basically observer

146
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,870
sort that's the story was large number

147
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,579
store Congress representing arranger
facets

148
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:36,290
0 worst cases

149
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,790
do you know it's pero average case

150
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,469
it for you what would you want to a
stable %uh

151

going us and it is what it is but his

155
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,150
their asses uncertainties 30

156
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,930
a smaller just so that yeah

157
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,270
morrow is up faster

158
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,040
and owner is much data from this so we
only index

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,500
partner Ashfaq just case you 0

160
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,980
what's that while base through

161
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,510
number owns there and

162
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:36,510
multiple that up basis of its this is
your

163
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,550
so I'm and that's a no-no so

164
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,500
a same-store passage I

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,550
no more than 15 and your buying decision
there

170
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,599
so you're on it at both or up

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,819
so I'm here are three the up paper

172
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,990
that this does this a visitor

173
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,319
about page intro the 740 at

174
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,620
there and I i actually came up with a
more efficient way

175
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,319
for this is the big day basically up

176
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:33,479
is a efficient way using

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,000
police and over I V number or up

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,610
is is really small affairs army officers
up

179
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,790
there so there is any

180
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,010
up is offer I was there as fast

181
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,829
10 said probably over 1 1,000,000

182
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,319
were there's not involve Sunday's I'll

183
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,780
official so way

184
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,020
up was using it up hochman

185
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,439
you for he showed he bottles

186
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,520
basically he spoke to her it

187
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,920
he's been 0 Harris

188
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,020
overalls so it's a big number every

189
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,350
use up is very easy to tell

190
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:27,350
up figure out you know

191
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,339
a so the decision her

192
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,949
up this is currently does not want all
the details of

193
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,709
down song so we can and cannot do it

194
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,359
for as your the average number or

195
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,390
up is the difference because presuppose

196
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,089
fungicide is so it was you know that
then we hit you

197
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,260
pero palminteri which

198
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,699
is a very efficient way %uh story offers
was you know he

199
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:01,760
up Thrissur basically so

200
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,170
basically what happens is up the average
case for using

201
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,219
Hocking Hills their of going

202
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,760
is up about the same

203
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
is the squad with okay I'll

204
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,470
no overt function where over passos's

205
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,540
around want the a its purview

206
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,990
I for Smith overpass forces

207
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,300
out one that's both yup

208
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,930
about Crescent place %uh that's usually
round of humour

209
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,099
17 this perky so

210
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,480
is smaller was any time but

211
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,279
me out worst case is going to be sources
are

212
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,120
as up the I'll

213
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,959
0 so up was yes it was arms

214

woo my production functions

280
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,050
so either is because it bothers

281
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,419
up there is divided British

282
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,570

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,380
is the diseases 64 was and

287
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,850
is very general production function up

288
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,939
I A and I

289
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,680
rewrote the up reductions use 32-bit

290
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,880
for the morning out of our so 6485

291
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,340
at you get a for us to increase our
views

292
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,419
I'll is also

293
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,500
by law preachers also 5 you

294
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,530
first-ever forever but they

295
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,629
more of those sources about for for

296
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,680
sorrow up

297
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,160
you others and

298
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,680
a reduction in force in pace of love a

299
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,370
it was in

300
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,419
up

301
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,110
basically this is %uh really fast

302
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,459
up diesel you I

303
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,690
he came over with a if the fuse doing
this

304
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,490
or GQ to yes doing

305
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,890
64 bit firearms you route through slow

306
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,180
so you woke up and you

307
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,920
basically a characters that CR five days

308
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,500
he's sees so our minus

309
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,880
so a long time ago well as is roughly
about that time about the evils doing

310
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,820
that I was a 0 I think you are also hot

311
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,669
immeasurable while so division so

312
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,780
up is to use you pretend that you're

313
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,410
cash forever has it doesn't work for

314
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,790
the mall live but he 0

315
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,010
never occurs in their site so that
injured I'm

316
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,370
in front of the whole or is between 0

317
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,989
at carriers oslo and then just your

318
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,380
but up 30 that of our

319
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,900
up there is a good football player is
getting faster

320
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,140
so as and also

321
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,240
five days more you

322
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,500
about European others you so and that

323
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,990
others extended of approaches other this

324
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,080
300 other is not here

325
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,290
he data Dr up

326
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,950
so there is no both

327
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,190
of or are I'll

328
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,350
facing off without another a share is
this a share

329
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,709
smaller visionaries with about may be
worth

330
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,840
a forever payrolls up are

331
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,040
third you for

332
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,909
up our and then there's

333
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,470
morrow which apparently K actually

334
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,800
just you it is I had a

335
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,590
is the got the random CATV

336
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,550
how mark roe small wish I was under the
impression that is extremely slow

337
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,520
and therefore can't use the goals for

338
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,220
Ruth a talk yesterday Santa

339
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,120
assessment for up and there is other guy

340
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,199
that the up probabilistic 0

341
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,160
are up balls Thursday

342
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,340
yes up up more

343
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,689
out his or up to those are just that but

344
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,720
he problem was a overalls

345
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,280
obviously you have this job yet he stays

346
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,610
hand you if they have is similar to you

347
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,000
feels except for you have a

348
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,400
right he had a at freidy's

349
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,650
ever boesky's and yeah I'm all these
logos

350
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,080
what the rules the I don't be scared

351
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,860
so your overall success rate for

352
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,080
the up his face is rather low book for
the

353
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,330
simple passes these exercises for the
heart for you

354
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,379
%uh passers the successes

355
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,730
basing their full so

356
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,030
up either to options without

357
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,530
up surplus sequel hoover's rather

358
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:11,620
so I always hear this and I was in this
half life getting

359
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,780
I'll is the I'll

360
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,139
rentals are close to you for
distribution in the SUV

361
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,280
out better coverage abuses

362
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,418
0 a so first step outside us

363
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,540
us wonderful a surplus

364
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,600
0 basically UK

365
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,139
you're going to a number that has 1000
to

366
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,700
this is your get it and I'm up

367
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,940
your actual server or up if you have

368
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,500
a troop surge it's going to use it. he
says

369
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,580
that wallet while is through

370
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,530
is this purposes are

371
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,080
a to chase so you brando

372
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,320
up you need raising

373
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,649
cycles are generated up chase that have
a

374
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,980
basically generates you

375
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,820
register both about some far

376
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,270
and you actually voted to say that as a
result

377
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,510
K basically just listen Sarah Jane it's
not actually the

378
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,790
of so race time

379
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,740
about a he's discovered so

380
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,300
haven't seen any papers actually
starting balances

381
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,928
I'll right hand over keys this story

382
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,090
I'll have so

383
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,658
when I actually follow is

384
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:48,350
so you for reading over there up

385
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,949
so a your number generator ya

386
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,130
posted Verde as a separate number

387
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,460
your your 10 cue

388
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,740
through and generate those numbers there

389
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,280
passes you very much numbers %uh

390
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,490
use those inserts up

391
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,030
well uses in so doing

392
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,860
zeros well this is not a random number
generator to

393
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,240
say it up other ones like up

394
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,550
and here so you

395
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,840
a better and number that so that

396
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,530
out there's issues you see

397
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,700
also so you have a first-class site

398
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,320
us third sir these are suppose

399
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,550
those passes the in exchange for
strongly

400
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,750
renzo passes you have

401
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,080
so there is moon

402
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,320
from one from that up

403
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,040
I Rutgers no difference he stays

404
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,899
covers that's not real true what's up

405
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:05,500
this is right called

406
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,030
I don't think that up predators really
good and she views

407
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,139
up so is it

408
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,700
rather

409
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,860
business there one person about Roma

410
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,949
for yeah

411
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,720
you so that well either tho

412
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,159
over the words like it was the other II

413
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,280
so is I think the his or

414
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,678
earlier I think

415
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:41,000
those you group

416
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,470
yes you were successful is well

417
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,610
though

418
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,889
surveyor for calls that their you

419
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:54,309
balls well your the

420
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,799
local sup ever made is %uh

421
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,370
don't know what up his circles are up

422
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,789
you have the same

423
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:11,049
success rate for howard's uses a base
their

424
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:17,549
fire which ones know or their versus
being like both red function

425
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,340
favorite I don't actually know which

426
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:28,000
circles are so up for

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,480
0 so

428
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,289
a for a ever it was more than just
generated

429
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,809
as a use or and the points

430
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,740
through movie2k and once businesses
throw

431
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,389
chains that hers because both
traditional

432
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:53,110
yet up

433
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,820
so thing you know he's out

434
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,889
what's up RSS

435
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,080
20

436
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,120
about 0 so the

437
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,379
probably uses that there are larger
welfare

438
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,900
passers you up create now hurts

439
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,270
that's where your movie 0

440
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,170
was up her up so they had to chase

441
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,800
murders same qualities up bro

442
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,030
up yeah future

443
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,170
more chase yeah the overall

444
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,890
but a real your product is

445
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,220
four-star

446
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,090
so scepter I heard

447
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,780
version obviously separation you I was

448
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,030
launch a as a obscenity

449
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,990
all your up chase up

450
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,520
at they have all these chase

451
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,730
up so generating all those cases are

452
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,190
want where you is so it was time does

453
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,060
you generate on your face you freed us
and

454
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,290
summer movie its then generates you see

455
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,450
up sees the 500 third

456
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,820
group up gives third to

457
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,560
both up venue finish out to you

458
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,990
10,000 he served with you do that

459
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,540
up basically his

460
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,810
the up mouth looked up

461
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,220
so you too on stuff is just over

462
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,670
fifty times I'll she says

463
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,100
yeah it is create yeah 90

464
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,330
right beside a 6s follow

465
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,110
was able before details up

466
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,649
for basically everything I'm doing it's
90 I

467
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,290
prisoner success it without or

468
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,330
tables I frozen russian fucked up

469
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,159
rate was able of people other of
principles are

470
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,460
probabilistic any that your

471
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,250
he faces a jerry's every he faces a
jersey

472
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,710
in your ratings or okay

473
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,770
older for cases I was

474
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,290
specifics you for at me

475
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:29,310
redlining is the limit obviously this is
where

476
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,320
after each way in the shade

477
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,760
you certain diseases but however

478
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,060
don't because up the amount works or

479
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,730
you good 0 0

480
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,440
so there are very for us up

481
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,580
the first basically up that's the worst
up

482
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,720
third which isn't up up uses metal for

483
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,910
functions so the way they're worth

484
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,990
for when a user is able you

485
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,310
Jerry a she's lamesa

486
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,690
no odor destructive

487
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,820
in that's preferable the starving
addresses the

488
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,760
up middle over up

489
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,670
I'll so

490
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,100
will you go out

491
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,500
are looking up value supper I

492
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,580
around the table you generate sup

493
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,300
up here it is and there is one of those
of

494
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,070
800 I star for you from that certainly

495
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,860
you %uh instructors chances are I'm

496
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,439
the hacer for up

497
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,550
so with little over from you know this
store

498
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,790
just or your 17 this

499

okay that's for yup

513
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,250
and more so number of chasing our table

514
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,720
up what about -2 is how it fits you can
say

515
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,700

all the Vizio Inc across for

522
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,050

are

523
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,040
the avoid see and the store up

524
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,720
he ever between I

525
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,140
good the difference between the

526
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:46,810
many regression line and the actual for
up

527
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,810
are yeah I was the first person from

528

up for free radicals are jerseys use
your

529

the real yeah I V

531
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,630
original or outflows for over those are
the roomies

532
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,399
Sarkozy which is very supportive just 60
bucks for

00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,440
che you

534
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,500
up so he knows %ah

535
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,909
file formats for per person per first

536
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,100
0 where r so

537
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,129
I compared to different cheeses

538
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:32,190
I size care I whatsoever

539
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,389
live was great poet

540
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,469
sounds like a few Gaza checkpoints

541
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:43,449
I third file for her

542
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,139
I have generated homes me are a perfect
fit perfect

543
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,230
up per case 406 that's all over

544
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,100
both upset about it the increase

545
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,400
out to you 342 30 stuff's not

546
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,270
the way well it is cheaper

547
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,340
summer really all this it's about
basically

548
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,420
BufferSize very simple he say so those
numbers are

549
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,330
are there for all I'm really about

550
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,640
ish up but basically from

551
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,750
all this up the best

552
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,990
is up perfect record labels it there

553
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,439
alright i dun outdoors be a perfect day

554
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,580
hires a former up third is

555
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,060
slightly slower what about

556
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,160
34 up rustlers

557
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,589
a this is because up your kids usually
get a start point

558
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,890
I does those car overheats that

559
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,100
so yes you don't you up

chair

562
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,419
and %uh so checkpoints

563
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,630
0 I actually you are

564
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,099

00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,549
assets here as your value had about

569
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:25,730
couple this for up well

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,809
como positions inside OJ where you've
got to stay there

571
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:32,890
so generated go for that is

572
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,930
say you then %ah generated was good

573
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,288
that represents that state

574
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:43,490
%uh so it was a your that

575
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,118

you have so you carry out

582
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:10,930
pocket a lookup

583
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,379
ability yes 10 and

584
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,029

it you also there is a

586
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,190
yes every dollar busy same positions

587
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,720
then all you do is you hair those few
this

588

so if they are the same to

593
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,799
I got a check for of false alarms for

594
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:57,030
sources 1100 10

595
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,530
Java I'll then you will even have to
check J

596
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,770
so I E only

597
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,788
my love work but actually did on this

but yeah okay up a better I'm sure

602
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:26,910
using water for it without

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,799
to go at the optimal rushing with 10,000
yup more

608
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:51,059
for our your up checkpoints

well office without perfect refusals
utterly false alarm for a

619
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,310
is actually 50 percent up were

620
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,160
be a generate growth a

621
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,250
senators it's pretty much Ulster

622
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,470
that prisoners for

623
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,339
for up

624
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,600
withdrawals well

625

so I love you because I was able up

626
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,310
yes this is time to yes so

627
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,420
but there's a workaround yes it's not a

628
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,740
star missus our

629
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,520
basically a to get around

630
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,530
I'm you have your day force up holes or

631
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,270
both up is the you fill your guests with

632
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,280
up passes from around the table

633
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,600
then from there you a false or that data

634
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,950
and that you have a if you

635
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,720
that represents up issue it in the

636
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,140
you are that's a pass it he says values
us

637
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,400
us at up you vote or

638
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,270
set his best score %uh if you're only

639
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,600
suitable his causes said

640
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,770
up it said although

641
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,550
what they do which is pay but its
pockets

642
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,860
that every the about

643
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,440
yes but if you don't have a
responsibility to all their bodies

644
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,880
over it and day really one bonds has
already out

645
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,810
houses it and have a separately

646
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,830
those passes I'll its

647
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,960
more I bolts or

648
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,280
a follow up to Buffalo facts

649
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,710
up he hurts

650
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,580
better is a US

651
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,750
you was sorely hashers a on wall

652
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,780
up a lot of questionable its a

653
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,330
the only are they the overuse is taking
over

654
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,450
social you try to use I was there are

655
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,750
up so lose your as a reserve during the

656
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,450
fire research so you have you worst-case

657
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,980
he 15 up a

658
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,560
after raises the perforce it's so

659
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,750
little overcast oceans which do you 1000
crazy

660
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,280
for four stages for forcible good

661
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,520
it you bastard %uh in the pattern

662
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,620
%uh Bay that both put it in CA 256

663
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,120
up files basically his casa

704
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,490
there's one problem with home sales you

705
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,859
up the overpass functions deserve a

706
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,870
because up you for his table when you

707
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,620
touching one while cross and there's as

one-third tables so and each time you
what about your children

00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,120
a star because it's a disturbing thats

710
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,680
you have to store up on its just a

711
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,120
that basically those extra base

712
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,750
will do area while subscribe to us

713
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,030
to pretty much the purpose

714
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:24,180
it is because there's there's a
stepped-up

715
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,250
Ian

716
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,870
you doing you check the up chamber

717
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:36,049
a false alarms

718
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:40,530
I'll so

719
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,090
generated his a there is a

720
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,420
her progress up this house

721
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,410
this year I'll there's this guy was

722
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,640
outs are not use up and you say borrow

723
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,589
you use a loom closer cue generous

724
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,260
so what this dude is yeah this up

725
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,370
how unstable as Jerry chase

726
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,750
you law insert knows

727
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:13,080
passages up moves author and

728
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,160
every times are in our own what's wrong
with both these

729
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,109
or yea the table up

730
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,300
that up if it is then you throw it say

731
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,730
the problem with who voters is up there

732
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:32,090
problem was that so if this means that
you know

733
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,140
a larger up sir or

734
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,810
very well it or so out but it's so

735
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,210
0 so

736
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,040
when I came up with what you see a you
have stable

737
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,320
obviously is a has tabled a estar for
that uses

738
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,010
up he who who I'll Cleveland

739
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,260
say or up

740
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,800
so basically what is it is up you have
to do

741
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,880
pass from his about first half Russian

742
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,900
a your so all of those are our is here

743
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,500
and it is up has something there you see

744
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,390
separate I have spoken which is that
there are about to read about the things

745
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,049
that

746
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,100
and that it but that's also

747
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,730
bill you go back to the first love you
what I was there

748
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,770
the store greater then you'd rather than
use

749
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,650
whatever out tests ocean

750
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,760

752
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,830
so and so reduced and have your

753
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,860
cycle or threshold out

754
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,000
at that time you many either expand

755
