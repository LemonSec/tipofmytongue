1
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:16,549
i and it is impossible for us grace

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,269
and i've been talking about the grabbing
his network architecture

3
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,168
always also includes a discussion of the
entire design of their working 'cause

4
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:27,279
bar

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,899
handling it very clear

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,129
so august currently background with

7
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:37,849
halloween peritonitis hospital actually
started

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,190
it began as a grassy does is he saying
our kids here have

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,580
uh... there was some discussion already
materials aunt doing very very hard for

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,150
a little substance of behaviors that we
have for research center that's

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,740
compositions

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,840
and well

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,390
what rescued can resist the thought of
advisor need forty eight hundred

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,980
u_p_s_'s

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,920
lula's it's very very early stages but
it was around

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,970
diagnose playing with it

17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,510
and it it would be my masters thesis

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,600
and innocent he says that

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,059
so v dot baskar reversing pool

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,329
that i have his law enforcer

21
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,508
i apologize for the things i heard a lot
of anybody has better suggestions by

22
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,430
being later

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,300
a-bands does they actually started
writing to use as a result of the

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,690
rainbow tables

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,880
to deal with

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,699
smaller hospital stays as a basis to use
everybody

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,409
in around about two thousand him

28
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,950
he was removed as a secret of his life
or sir

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,419
with the sequels bremerton

30
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:50,910
it was filled with only this morning

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,460
uh... around two thousand one hundred
around with some of the networks is

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,179
working

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,630
because they realize that c_n_n_ single
systems was

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,149
going to be troublesome rather than
later

35
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,990
add that i was recently if i had been

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,759
working longer

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,669
when she is the todd

38
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,809
rule had forced her

39
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,869
than it is easy was it was for her

40
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,849
uh... without feliciano betsy do you
currently supported

41
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,209
i want to be goals of this is to
eliminate duplicates

42
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,109
uh... those of you

43
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:29,730
rhetoric or modify password records and
probably go with the fact that a lot of

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,418
incumbency dvd copy pasted

45
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,459
was changed our lives

46
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,540
wishes on it

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,689
saluted by losing at things in case you
want listed on another and so i was

48
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:45,138
trying to eliminate as much as possible
to makes sense

49
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,219
or better

50
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,319
the reason that i would hope that this
is working at home c l_ o_ c_ k_ you

51
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,268
right now is partly because of what's
been happening with technology in the

52
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,809
last uh... oh

53
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,639
five years or so

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,010
when i started back in two thousand
seven uh... who lives in its infancy

55
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,899
and had just come out of a lot of
minorities

56
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,689
pgs were right

57
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,509
and i've really considered um

58
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:14,600
but uh... decided the initial cost and
the possibility bowers and

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,709
uh... program

60
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,629
made for mba model

61
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,009
enough without stopping

62
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:25,708
obviously a very very value but not newt
you want to be his versus how many if

63
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,430
you want video cards

64
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,279
uh... itself processor

65
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,640
was discussed uh... really

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,569
working about eighteen he would be good

67
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,828
elizabeth hospital for it

68
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,529
fellini's all processes haiti

69
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:44,420
indecision recap one lesson has got any
faster

70
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,569
so

71
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,108
uh... finally their receipt you options

72
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,809
and uh...

73
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:54,159
does indian

74
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,698
jane we still have the is much more
mature they haven't had cars that don't

75
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,619
work very well the house for cracking
writing out but uh... i don't

76
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,739
it actually is

77
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,409
when marcia liberal reform

78
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,569
i think he was still an option

79
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,478
embarrassed to i'd like to add support
at some point

80
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,259
uh... i just don't have it here is that
there are much lower priority

81
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,829
than other technologies

82
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,939
wien bold over what's going on right now

83
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,490
is got cars boats you know

84
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,879
which is what the vast majority of
people supporting

85
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,129
we have much more interesting better
instructions down with two hundred fifty

86
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,400
six villages uh... corroboration

87
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,568
and uh... finally out of any of you have
looked at it in hells ya final processor

88
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,040
has five hundred profit factors

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,050
and looks like there could be very
interesting architecture

90
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,379
four password

91
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,770
uh... crime

92
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,289
so that the element or service for a
season

93
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,430
is any gpl

94
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,589
these few moments for school

95
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,919
occurrences were indeed review arms

96
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,519
that most people use

97
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,499
with especially hermida

98
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:10,099
opens he helped us to use his work

99
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,810
eames he was lost

100
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,989
with delivery edta

101
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:15,599
thank you languages

102
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,498
at the credit

103
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:18,449
and his leg

104
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,499
tonight has integrated network support
machines are not relying on anything

105
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:26,749
regarding libraries uh... she has
stopped pcl

106
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,300
and the i_r_a_ or any of the cost of my
greatest i have had more support for a

107
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,399
political games and we are right

108
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,280
troy adopted uh... i don't want anyone
else

109
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,169
product this is a

110
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,849
so that our objection amusing to do this
in his uh...

111
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:46,009
pretty standard laboratory actually

112
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:46,860
a habit

113
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,209
the reason that i'm doing this is you
avoid as much

114
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,639
recruiting as possible

115
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,139
so that i filed last uh... involves
redeemed

116
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,040
passport files to the following a c

117
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,569
from radio formats with a variety of
different

118
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,550
quirks

119
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,329
that's a lot of these classes i have the
plane crash

120
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:16,479
class which contains apostle prosperous
i have the sultan classes that i also

121
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,369
support weird things for things like
uh... well i g hashes

122
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,810
w_p_a_ a things they have a lot of extra
day without

123
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,159
uh... this is all supported into these
classes immunizations come out

124
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,509
and there is something else

125
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,699
you had to do this so is good for things
like the old ashok passion which is just

126
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,009
to be sixty four hundred hash with

127
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,199
uh... prefix

128
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,599
all i have to do is overriding global
functions everest dash violently class

129
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,120
this is a personal matters the us as a
shade denied he had his our religious

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,900
almanac

131
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,609
lists so heater or

132
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,299
members of our reporters overrun
functionality databases before he got it

133
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:07,789
and i don't want to know on about how he
loves the lord layers and

134
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:08,719
uh...

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,780
it's harder to screw things up

136
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,359
orders for the exemplars of the day

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,059
uh...

138
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,759
so for the actual lobby

139
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,069
animals however in operation

140
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,659
i had a lot of different levels

141
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:26,650
the

142
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,650
basis plus controls the move all of the
grandfather in time for will

143
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,369
as attorney general reno process because
it's really

144
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:41,220
almost identical will use your seat you
corner

145
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,789
of seattle or internationally organized

146
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,688
and well and i i i i didn't know it is a
concept alacrity zach

147
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:54,889
usa sciences diesel some in work clothes
outside of the different

148
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,059
yes

149
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:01,189
and hashes nationally request the sense
that he issued a after these classes

150
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:07,459
here all of this solaris is really the
reason that i had a chance to us

151
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,839
unless a lot of the technology levels of
middle bcl

152
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,499
i'll see you

153
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:16,830
and samples in psychology across the
wrong time

154
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,469
coming from all over the years

155
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:19,909
from device

156
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:24,639
and any other general
technology-specific function

157
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,639
uh... the next level will be hashed
specific n

158
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,130
instantiation a host of this basically
serves as a transfer later into the

159
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,090
device for us it hasn't been able to
accomplish it

160
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,570
i get a cost of values that they need at
least serves dissipated hurdles

161
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,599
we hang out of the highest level

162
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,530
uh... and

163
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,689
largely accuses predefined lost that i
have

164
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,309
sos mostly

165
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:53,850
and limitation

166
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,520
and uh...

167
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,160
so that yes you can read it sounds like
more hungry

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,620
uh... example

169
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,890
these are some of the classes that i
have

170
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,990
uh... passionately process of dependency
even valencia classes

171
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,090
and we set out to the various fashion
items

172
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,860
uh... each

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,800
has there

174
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,490
specifically by screw-up

175
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,510
attache

176
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,310
of looking at the old c l_ version

177
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,979
we have

178
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,440
pretty much the same thing

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,130
promotes yet

180
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,980
and get them all the good news out of
the laurels so using reviews that after

181
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,490
priestesses national

182
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:49,490
uh... without getting into use some of
the

183
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,650
hinges on the side of the letter that he
sent out of darling munchies europe

184
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,449
a hybrid work down into the work yes and
this is one of the standard methods of

185
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,200
splitting a large task across a wide
variety of devices or systems

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,590
i had the support for by tomorrow
because this is where recession

187
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,410
do you jack

188
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,750
and he's working contains relevant
information

189
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,010
for his childhood problem which reduced
our point of view

190
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,370
plan for reports

191
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,770
it also contains a slight pastoral and
that's why it's contribution he he was

192
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,130
the individual crashing press
essentially say we're done

193
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,030
or and friends are still working so
great because you made a sign of

194
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,689
something uh... general other

195
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,960
corroboration flat-out

196
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,879
i'd also include wordless into the
market wish i don't have

197
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,480
a little bit later

198
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,600
and he's working contains a clean tidy

199
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,990
for identifying which is why it has
requested

200
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,320
this is a little of some of the robust
functionality over the network because

201
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,850
unfortunately machines for him to go
visit her and a lot of cracking

202
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,580
operation

203
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,660
or fresh or the network is the next four
com pesticides are going to have an

204
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,019
aberration or

205
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,049
and agrawal

206
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,470
does get disconnected

207
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,610
abdul he has been a highly unreliable
environment

208
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,810
i want to be able to make sure that i
have tried every possible combination

209
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,109
does that surprise animals is working

210
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,970
unity

211
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,410
network failure

selvam

213
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,120
the way this is actually coming up

214
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,830
degeneration parameters are starting to
work in the class of your work robert

lewis thomas

216
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,790

brute force space or anything else uh...

219
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,370
this is not so that i find out casey
twenty four pm worth working as well

220
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,470
program starts

221
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,600
doesn't usually work

222
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,630
whether these requested

223
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,110
absent today

224
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,740
will leave the requested by you have for
rent were never quite

veto implementing q

226
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,430
and this is where you live

227
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,750
emitting working-class walter rot

228
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,910
appeal if there is some of the best

229
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,100
uh... sir

230
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,410
thank you is were kids that have not

231
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,900
yet been assigned

232
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,370
to device i keep a bash

233
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,410
available so they can decide quickly

234
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,020
women around by a thread

235
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,720
deal with things like you and this is
where the bright idea matters

236
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,760
even is completed successfully

237
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,660
the working against retired andrew

238
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,990
it might crashes disconnects for things
to say irregular heartbeat however i'll

239
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,830
be working across globe and receive
messages from the network are saying

240
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,620
this morning and he has disconnected or
blacked out

241
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,160
and all the work is from atlanta and
legal issue back into the infusion

242
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,420
indesign

243
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,790
two different device

244
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,110
so they can actually get executed

245
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,470
sounds of the race

246
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,630

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,600
is uh...

250
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,530
businesses on how i view my network
architecture

251
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,850
you've got eighty grams error wishes
sets of eyes

252
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,720
the process and ending up being quiet
work more specifically what alliance

253
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,110
the content of this error

254
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,310
and each class talks to it's comparable
instantiation on your house

255
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,510
of the characters etc pass and hostility
or is it possible so that work

256
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,870
safer national milestones

257
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,910
the working class and

258
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,120
and this is handled by me

259
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,950
the network client-server classes

260
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,830
wish so we shall do get back and forth
across the network our network cost does

261
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,859
not know what the hell final classes
because i don't wish characters

all of those is that

policy realizing he certifies data from
the network last into

275
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,979
uh... this is a process

276
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,550
undirected

277
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,810
conveniently

278
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,540
there are some variables serialization
libraries without a whole protocol

holidaylettings dot with our

281
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,689
it usually does not go well

282
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,330
uh... exiles great except for the fact
that it's about an entire section data

283
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,290
ourselves civilization buyer is working
again that andrea

284
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,459
every year charlene large amounts of
data rows networking wit and humor you

285
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,160
want something that's fairly officially

286
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,730
binder draft our international stuff
yourself

287
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,850
can work

288
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,630
it's really difficult

289
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,500
it tends to be

290
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,290
relatives of architecture specific added
problems

291
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,480
thirteen sixty four-bit systems
personally to me

292
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,100
a lot of work to make sure that you
don't have those problems

293
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,980
so protocol buffers are a very efficient
binary fax machine readable

294
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,670
designed for teams using our computers

295
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,319
he had asked for

296
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,360
asking version but this is not the

297
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,520
uh... they're designed for two years ago
computers

298
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,000
the rappers

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,920
battle with optional field so if you
choose to change your demeanor and

300
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,779
additional fields fees are optional
youthful breaking

301
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,710
backwards compatibility

302
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,360

clinics

304
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,390
uh... because each class is talking
believes in other instances that class

305
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,500
across the network each class who has
told him he can

306
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,770
custom-designed broke all over for the
day that he needs to transfer

307
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,720
uh... and

308
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,090
cadences of the network last surpasses
data back

309
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,560
one thing that i haven't gotten quite
yet is fresh network possible there was

310
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,410
very good compression libraries fat

311
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,159
affectively impresses worthless here

312
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,080
releasing them for viruses right across
the network

313
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,190
this matter as well

314
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,300
uh... internet skilled workers

315
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,490
is easier

316
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,950
yourself

317
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,370
that's the events that these of

318
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:10,060
most part of a problem with word lists
of working some of these issues

319
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,960
has actually very very relevant to the
evidence today they are talking about

320
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,140
creative ways to do

321
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,200
yes has slipped

322
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,770
the problem has been

323
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,790
during maximum limits

324
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,680
or supported

325
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,130
in some cases buses algorithm specific
in some cases are country specific

326
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,740

alongside mister aspin cracking

328
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,559
most of the most important to amass when

329
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,470
tipsy twenty seven

330
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,930
characters for a cure

331
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,150
fifty-five

332
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,890
already fired because when she confessed

333
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,050
water cooperation

334
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,658
the sense i'm very model of the water
heater general

335
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,690
is probably one of the house for winners
also there

336
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,529
like the pratap

337
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,120
possibly because most most of the
product

338
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,459
also most of the work list

339
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,890
functions right now you're dealing with

340
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,840
a single file source or a single in good
standing

341
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,870
if you've got a lot more all

342
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,649
differences as forgetting

343
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,930
tools that you wish to use

344
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,710
utoronto sequentially or you can do some
up

345
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,510
somebody

346
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,450
priest reemerging but

347
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,450
there's not really a good way of doing
it right now

348
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,289
and other distributes it word for word
lists supposed to start working on

349
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:40,260
ourselves lesions involved as you get
all of those first

350
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,400
another's

351
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,210
expenses are the only solution on the
right now

352
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,080
i said i want to use all of us

353
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,740
care

354
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,270
my solution again

355
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,800
to the bottom line of clothing from
anything else on

356
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,240
vinod hester or attacker

357
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,750
starts with the reverse and entrance to
on

358
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,390
whatever's

359
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,110
they wish to use

360
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,139
you used on the river i'm continues to
be hashed out cebu

361
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,440
you can use custom python scripts you
can also trigger does is they started

362
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,640
senses or any other particular technique

363
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,410
you so desire

364
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,950
the data from all of these is thinking
she demanding

365
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,190
network server

366
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,300
are

367
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,860
murray ut four four four four

368
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,570
and served in the since you're a large
number of strings is what's

369
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,840
so you can basically thrown in

370
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,428
whenever you want

371
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,240
a grass it

372
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,080
processes that

373
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,389
stands as an attorney who lives in uses
and will rule applies false and work

374
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,340
pros many sisters as you want that

375
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,530
and within reason

376
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,480
and other sales is obviously not as fast
as we were closed out of the nation on

377
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,229
the viewers but

378
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:06,200
for assault masters of our cash flows
forceful actions

379
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,500
is actually publication

380
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,900
any other than that i've done with this
fetus is work going spoke to a hundred

381
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,860
points out

382
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,540
the owner of this uh... so far

383
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,159
which happens to my knowledge

384
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,870
company class

385
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,580
now i would like to ship your slightly

386
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,860
and america really hits

387
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,129
there's still

388
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,390
disturbing developments because very few
people are actually solving a prosperous

389
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,719
uh... as noted earlier in order to the
nation

390
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,680
the hurricane ridiculously large

391
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,670
difficult to transfer

392
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:51,729
has really been huddling audio brenda
brenda table-size it's harder to shuffle

393
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,899
bowl terrorized aid around the internet

394
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:59,510
and it was always so they want to live
by trained animals which are looking to

395
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,000
have you ever had terrorized

396
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,750
there's really no way with that

397
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,870
i'd be happy to bid on external hard
drives a less forgiving

398
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,570
software reading also

399
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,550
or harbor

400
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,409
simple solutions

401
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,120
there's also the probability forever to
download

402
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,750
obligate you try to download

403
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,360
probably writes for random cases

404
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,000
broderick process

405
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,899
uh... resolution to this was something
that i call it a bulls and use this life

406
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,659
at my dot com talk

407
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,860
uh...

408
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,559
however i go to a lot more details so

409
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,000
we don't think that's fine

410
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,659
for those of you who have not removed

411
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:42,389
were

412
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:44,820
accessible over the rainbow tables

413
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,879
i had to go over a little bit of the
kennedy hash generation process because

414
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,860
it's relevant to understanding this and
understand how it was different i was

415
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,780
different

416
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,539
some of the senate password

417
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,640
out to the website contracted

418
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,000
uh... solutions

419
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,630
work tables

420
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,629
theoretically allows you to

421
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:09,238
she uses that power to use multiple
service without disclosing workplace

422
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,990
tests

423
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,930
something in the last interesting
potential impact model suggested and

424
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,640
would be happy to have conversations
with other people have ideas but

425
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,120
at the very least makes it difficult

426
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,510
so overstepping

427
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,820
three and a little rock music and a half
generation

428
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,689
and it was basically where you live

429
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,970
the hash i'm looking for was a decision
zero

430
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,220
interchange

431
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,450
well we reduce it to you

432
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,010
we started generation process

433
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,020
what it was a decision what we start
there

434
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,450
we run it through

435
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,840
with the durham after they were looking
for

436
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,409
at all of the possible decisions the
chain

437
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,980
including

438
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,010
uh...

439
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,300
alas position at which point your heart
ashes would be sent across the network

440
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,149
to the server

441
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,120
most people will be are comfortable with
this form

442
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,500
very good reasons so the evil

443
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,620
is his profit last year's

444
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,239
this is configurable

445
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,059
but how happy you got the best faced the
attacker has to go back

446
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,250
assassination frankie avalon is the
whole

447
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:28,020
because many many happy useful back down
into the same password

448
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,400
so the next step

449
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,490
reliable racking is diminishing search
for the people search

450
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,670
uh...

451
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,370
holes because this improves performance
on staying arthritis

452
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,760
as for the masses into digital order

453
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,260
viet faqs search process that goes
through the tables on august third

454
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,269
comes up with the gene starts you're
married orestes work whatever your

455
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,190
particular representations

456
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,120
so what about a little stars

457
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,419
use salim please thesis on this

458
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,200
crews were real server

459
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,890
political story process looks like

460
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,799
much more detail

461
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,360
is you start with the kennedy hashes now
there is sort of work

462
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,889
because in addition menzies you're
almost there were

463
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,450
the dot

464
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,750
metals the borges is more desirable for
an attacker to figure out what square

465
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,000
dean acheson is actually something of
that

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,960
i've really missed undesirable sending
hundreds of what he has about twenty

467
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,420
five

468
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,960
if you can distinguish all of your
invoice from one another with

469
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,280
after the entire sixty-seven units

470
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,649
then there's no reason not to do that
because you don't lose any additions c

471
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,800
but it is a good data storage space

472
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,639
so the work is processed child stasis
down to favor

473
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,490
there's also a debate

474
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,660
label sports

475
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,460
and uh... i think anything together

476
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,769
in a initially also question

477
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,490
and um... this is all actually binary is
not the

478
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,710
bassinets

479
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,740
so

480
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,930
business out of this error

481
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,890
we should

482
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,840
reforms a number of calls you back at
the table server status is

483
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,289
you ronald the user perspective

484
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,570
other than to know

485
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,970
at the u_n_ candles that had concealed
issue

486
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,919
pretty much analytical

487
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,500
karen's phone zero so it's not really a
problem

488
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,980
but i can't see it

489
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,690
and so on and the federal reserve user

490
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,300
when they get the results

491
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,750
the results are sent back

492
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,380
frolicking webserver

493
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,750
to the client

494
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,690
casey's as the chances of getting
regenerating

495
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,740
whose shoes

496
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,750
the final stage wishes for jamie
generation

497
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:11,750
and looking for the tower

498
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:18,149
the default as i said earlier is skipped
the last option headache

499
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,840
to have a hashes

500
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,919
buses these responsible if you want to
see or you can

501
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,580
if you want to see us you can elections
chooses beautiful

502
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,540
because for the correct might be a
tension went from two hundred thousand

503
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,430
the losses as you can see

504
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,340
really is a very significant

505
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,419
would is a possible back-end

506
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,360
so it can be sealed easily if you have

507
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,709
primal servers going to do it at all
this is transparent to the end user

508
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,580
which is the call

509
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,990
and plan

510
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:58,410
the biggest convention web tables is
that there is your opinion about whether

511
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,720
you don't you hang out on the double
terrorized there's only two years

512
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,050
i do not need to have a lot of our
residential connection

513
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,620
you just go ahead and start using it

514
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:15,409
and have full access to politicians

515
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,989
tug boats that obvious

516
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:23,989
for america's attention

517
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:33,870
isothermal especially

518
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,940
allowed us although some of them talking
about

519
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,820
eliot divided

520
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,879
was that was the software is available

521
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,830
are all these other talked about his
unless he had

522
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,100
about uh...

523
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,699
everything else releasing but losses
although he has yet ruled on the part of

524
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,940
it with his car

525
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,700
about some of the matter

526
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,390
tables not as yet because it's
irrelevant too

527
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,480
house are used but i do actually have a
server scripting albeit it can be used

528
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,550
to that point

529
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:19,550
walked alongside

530
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,289
it was a pleasant before development

531
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:27,179
undesirable and keep it open in the
future

532
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,560
i have

533
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,408
uh... might might go lay down our
melanie peoples forces framework

534
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,120
is more complete

535
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,929
very mature state are starting out over
the place

536
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,979
i'd also like

537
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:47,290
teachers throughout the bill such that
you have a seat you only bill

538
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:52,790
that he didn't want to know silverware
network as a trend is a service or is

539
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,980
that right on

540
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,920
assaults

541
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,400
yet with be removed himself

542
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:08,400
on and you are a supporter of the
military and shot him and he says cables

543
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:15,010
probably get around to u_s_ more over
the time says they show up in a while

544
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:21,660
if anyone wants to hold his contact me
because this really is that stuff

545
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,889
don't have a request for double-sided
adhesive

546
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,629
think i wonder who's using that but i'm
sure somebody's because it's clearly a

547
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,029
device that secures regular shaadi
physics
