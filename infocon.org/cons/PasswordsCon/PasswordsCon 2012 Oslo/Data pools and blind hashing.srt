42
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,410
checking asses days well

43
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,890
everybody is the chances collision

44
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,238
you have to use or Tennessee passes

45
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,000
useless used to it this for five call

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,310
some 50 years old and in 18 chances
after the collision so

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,670
the biggest the biggest simply that was
on the race and

48
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,010
I whose with no collisions both wasn't
from

49
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,459
they're all all of which is in case it's
not obvious

50
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,459
uses tables you have name Sol

51
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,709
do that he's mad the song path you throw
at you have to

52
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,569
both well there's nothing here

53
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,369
this is releasing it so it plays out in
about four hours the blocking up

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,819
no so let's assume that he has acted

55
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:38,379
use an as is and this is interesting
this was a person's a

56
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,500
loses I think your book it was reported
that I've the

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,019
okay fine home you know Sol

58
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,560
to use Mac love that's all and some back
or password you want you used to get

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
that the cow

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,239
maybe after you market does a believer

61
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,040
I see that is able

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
know if you have to use the word okay
for the same user and no way to audit

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,129
user who studies at his heels of a lover
in India

64
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,989
if there's this you know you might've a
new users in a hundred billion

65
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,150
rosen the okay so how we protect against
this fantasy

66
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,209
I'll so now know so I'm

67
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,899
you he's not getting these 10 you find
anything that he will

68
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,989
in the corresponding soul to this is the
right number so is it having

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,800
one home with stuff was renovated you
have two columns so I was going to do it

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,360
and then

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,040
it was well you tell ro that has it that
has age 18

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,979
actually matters because of you you know
he's not

73
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,680
it was awesome in about a year if you
care to you have to

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,910
what does this do so in order to get
dizzy about us we're

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,770
you have viewed at burst into the park
so

76
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,789
okay not worried about receiver this is
very interesting

77
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,169
own was not good enough and

78
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,210
up a few things I love about it

79
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,280
is located is your overtime is in slower
time

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,570
this possibly time you pass it you
looking for

81
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,250
our own people is this verse is wrong

82
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,449
all there's also the Service may just
lose a

83
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,830
we really want this has the will to have
no valid info in it

84
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,650
that if it were his own use nothin' but

85
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,080
the machines are no soo much because
when it finds a

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,740
if you give me the hash and and trust
will go if their news all that was about

87
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,960
I'll solar also sorta

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,310
W um and is talk of weeks ago

on any of the well is often slow

95
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,610
flattens out these others his we can
compress it

96
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,160
we'll just take the made his first 24
busy these past through

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,270

available we can know %uh in with my the
Senate ass

99
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,880
just ass wasn't able now to have it
right actually deal with this

100
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,530
130 so

101
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,780
okay well I'm still stuck in the soviet
as the thinking about it a lot

102
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,460
is OK what about the Fort Worth I love
you Hannah

103
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,919

104
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,299
like that okay you home she gets all

105
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,539

106
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,219
so ass muscle player and pull the

107
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,449
whatever 32 bytes all-out you that is
all

108
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,500
okay so do videos is

109
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,090
divall doesn't grocery as

110
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,289
new users are at if your size is great
it's a constant Lucy

111
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,070
and also whatever process is dealing
with this beautiful

112
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,830
when is your behalf I V as nuclear with
after is about us we weren't

113
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,289
this to be a very is obviously there's
information the

114
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:13,120
if you have to see if one run it as a
certainty

115
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,060
so nothing was gonna stick 100 terabytes
up on their network somewhere

116
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,780
with you one passing as a Service uses
concert

117
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,940
so it's the worst use of it you cuz I

118
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,139
user and password is it says

119
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,560
okay fulfillment also want to do this

120
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,270
well and that has to do this baby saw
one has to have nothing to do with each

121
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,448
other

122
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,319
if you see you do you still say steve
Hayes an easy sell

123
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,490
you see is all ass you for giving an
hour because

124
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,310
you he's not a up to get that was either
that's all

125
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,180
well their call out they're going to
give

126
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,009
the house up to the days are over right
to the store this was in the back is all

127
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,530
and we'll do that you he's back in the
air fish

128
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,979
well so use

129
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,039
I without I yeah so the step to some

130
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,080
people Valley and don't lose money into

131
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,150
I'm on this and we build service massive
happened did

132
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,590
well and so the more LoopNet foresees
you wanna nicely once I

133
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,549
mother providing the service a very
beautiful

134
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,190
on I'll very little progress is the

135
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,299
mmm affect we do you think that maybe

136
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,008
is just surrender to buy I'm on

137
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,099
this I can do things like what was on
there i ID

138
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,409
so no se for my server is that as I B

139
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,380
or these ID's and so so using next to
you

140
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,069
and asked for assault with his Audi
every zaxbys

141
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:55,089
on we're gonna asiana

142
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,420
whatever comes back after they give us
without you

143
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,319
so that no

144
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,998
so that they don't really have control
over what uses the US

145
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:11,829
anyways maybe I'm a Leo so that they did
this he is not actually didn't give

146
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:15,410
and that means in time saving on

147
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,410
we want me bc it will use it so there's
basically if you

148
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,059
if you only live once in the pool than
the things I was able to see a

149
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,969
fifty-percent you beautiful

150
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,480
and they were firing addition against it
fifty percent of their

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,559
attempts with actually be able to
resolve into up

152
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,420
the actual jet views and you we never
gave it to you can give you

153
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,929
yeah but if you look at all times it

we're really going online mister weeks
very very interested to hear all

171
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:50,459
feedback %uh used in beta testing it
began singing at five you play with it

172
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,638
if you're interested in the Aussie CC do

solid

174
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,720
so you know and questions

175
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,100
both for every dollar we are the only
life going

176
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,129
up the store still sore but this was
before

177
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,629
if you know the password so which is
somewhere

178
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,779
about if if there was thinking your
country agency with my cousin coffee

179
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,269
about beautiful

180
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,589
this is really cool people well that was
a

181
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,910
the day before has no value

182
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,809
the set that the site is now that where
these are

183
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:32,850
if you lose the rule now it was still
assessing this

184
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,649
and your you're good to go but the day
belonged its own gives you know

185
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,579
so sites the reason and yeah and it's a

186
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,719
if they get hacked they want something

187
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,649
must i'm absolutely beautiful so that I
i have to be in there

188
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,259
I your country or fresh in my mind

189
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,040
get a coke about the business were about
to tell us about

190
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,079
yeah it would be silly this year

191
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,459
in this one of classic may be any
negativity but

192
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,660
on the good

193
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,399
the the worst case scenario is that no
better off than you were before

194
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,119
and while it is fully compatible with if
the site once the US would be good

195
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,329
whatever they want to do

196
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,618
before the impasse over the new and I
i'm having heard

197
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:23,230
as much resources they have to do is you
know

198
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,449
the strengthening on their side um we're
going to try to return

199
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:31,399
for every was it comes in we want to
respond as quickly as possible as Liz

200
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,899
leads is possible workers in things like
up you know sitting up authors and

201
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,049
designers so that people can have

202
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:44,100
like long-term opened SSL connections so
that there's no easy for setting up

203
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,249
and funny or buts about

204
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,509
on you know so the service thousands of
this point becomes

205
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:56,029
having a very large is that love is easy
I don't believe all arent most the

206
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:56,829
Senators

207
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,660
geographically distributed

208
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,738
so

209
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:07,119
is time goes by you will need to make
the who

210
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,149
beer yes from

211
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,839
so there's a some other things are going
to go into Ivory's are

212
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,540
full business start-ups the question
whether it will review and user for says

213
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,089
one answers in this

214
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,629
on you busy the hatches and the Beast as
inputs

215
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,230
and just extend it right away agree all
their asses on the one

216
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,600
for you to ask people love you make it a
little years

217
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,839
um you can also when somebody Watson

218
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,199
I'll is you increase double the size of
the pool

219
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,049
you do a two-step process services
without even an upgrade

220
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:46,689
I'll so basically free job id: will be
tracking how the table was when that

221
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:48,230
happened he was free

222
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,480
and then over time if the opposite
workers are being the people use it and

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,949
I'll

224
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:56,170
you know so thereby 602 475

225
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,449
or work from you how I

226
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,010
this is moment

227
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,459
impose if I wasn't because it's also
something that might be harmful

228
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,099
I'll some so getting in getting an easy
easy

229
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,110
and so because I

230
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,870
believe their sons and try using this
app you got served in order to get

231
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,050
you do it you can you do the upgrade
asking or you can say

232
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,339
just new users we're also gonna have a
system reviews from ask you

233
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,410
%uh and say oh I just wanna do me this
is

234
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,180
this is so that the site put it so I
wanted to use is that

235
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,829
survey you know they can they can often
do it as long as they want

236
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,819
and enough doubt it when the user logs
even just you are you

237
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,170
you pull them up ideal business loans so

238
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,540
yet what do you want to sell his police
officers of Missouri

239
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,949
your I this one on one reprisal

240
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,130
own I'm here or are just under 5,000

241
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,800
you what yes we have some pricing I mean
I don't know since uprisings this point

242
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,010
is going to depend on

243
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,089
I think pricing depends on a beautiful
is

244
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,279
where you want to be senator be so for
example

245
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,470
someone who wants to connect with this
interview %uh

246
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,940
US my a class then somebody who wants it
is it is it more costly

247
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,450
you know wounded right you know cuz

248
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,149
you don't think you want this or three
pretty darn close it is not cool located

249
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:23,320
in the same designers you

250
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,810
to he believes it out I'll because any
network leases

251
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,910
is his loss is lost I'm it's an added
value like remastered

252
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,079
I'll workplaces I

253
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,120
exact not your day expose

254
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,649
actually you complete views

255
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,899
up you do whatever yes declines

256
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,450
doesn't get lucky and if the site if
that goes out

257
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,660
so the the officers was down just like

258
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,829
if you're using me %uh any other

259
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,830
are ya condition yep if they go down in
the office without going down fast

260
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,430
we don't good poet then yeah

261
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,709
you needed was a the first love is and
I've had my service is a good one

262
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,219
but the good thing is is absolutely no
impact on the

263
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,580
user experience and that music should we
were because

264
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,740
users do not want do not care they want
to see the brand of the site and want

265
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,440
you to

266
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,180
they wanna see it completely on but say
they don't care that

267
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,209
sums up me back in um and

268
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,380
we're not know anything about the user's
anything about the password

269
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,939
%uh we do you know we get acid is about

270
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,970
you know that that could be another
person

271
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,860
we have no idea how many user even like
me you think you could start with you

272
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,020
I think that something like that up for
life what is your one-stop

273
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,760
that's probably a small you cards yes

274
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,010
yellows blues truth

275
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,800
yeah and i'm looking for. so liza we've
got some fun

276
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,640
%uh we wanna for kick-starting this
looking for people

277
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,869
who at certain skill sets that good
since the operation of them

278
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,229
are you seeing you there okay so

279
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,260
to created the school beautiful love
them to be right

280
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,900
on their so was weird is

281
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,209
you passes they have a feed from other
sites yeah

282
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,300
mo if you ask like ever and ever for
data it doesn't

283
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,909
oversaw you to you but you have to send
it from the venue

284
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,750
def what's that way people okay

285
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,929
um so you know there's that and then
that the other thing

286
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,330
I was eating out was in 15 whatever the
there and abuse you with a

287
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,760
unit for getting the key um running
through your site reason for getting

288
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,360
safer

289
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,699
I'll obviously the data itself

290
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,679
but the whole of the protections the
address generate measures random and

291
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,780
perfecting their craft

292
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,950
is the whole business is the whole
business %uh

293
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,080
you feel that none you've got a customer
so we've ever done series

294
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,320
also you need you can you life

295
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,700
triplicate feedback i've starting

296
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,100
Iron Mountain anything Tribune you can
easily offline

297
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,770
because you can never lose the ball it's
one thing to go down for sixty seconds

298
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,620
and I think the

299
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,350
actually a personable we're also looking
at things like I'll

300
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,559
my if the if the filesystem at the
destruction that this

301
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,230
I'm detected because you see through
these

302
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,300
there's a lot of things to think about
I'll

303
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,350
that's that that's the idea actually
sell yeah the the question the answer

304
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,159
out to steal some other answer is we
don't know yet some other dances with

305
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,929
we thought a lot about I'll we thought
