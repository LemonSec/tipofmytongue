yeah I know I'm

86
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,090
if is the result of these Google with a

87
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,250
what you want to get all the money is it
isn't a

88
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,469
came around publication and theoretical
understanding you need to be a little

89
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,810
slow cooker group I'll see you

90
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,950
if you love here I important for among

does not have a a I'd also its

92
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,409
to to apply or we got me it was the old

93
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:12,789
what was up at nightline is to produce

94
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,259
some that at me I go back

95
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,050
I started off by saying that I'm think
it would be very good

96
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,720
to get rid of toxins maybe even if we
believe ego that

97
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,810
I have in mind or something even better
that would saying goes

98
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,810
still very difficult for these things
even when it exists to display sponsors

99
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,190
and I'll I'm a save your life at 185

100
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,280
likes this now having said that I
believe that bosses are tired

101
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,429
both for me to be people that first year
you want to save money

102
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,600
%uh us share the speed and that's
important

103
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,860
as the number of things with which we
have direct deposit

104
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,590
grows and grows and grows and grows will
have to say but that just doesn't work

105
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,210
no matter how much we have invested
five-year deal subsequently more

106
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,599
maybe what you know may want to be in
five years maybe drive years time

107
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,259
at someone who their hands on their next
so I will start now

108
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:05,370
thinking about work could be something
it would be great

109
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,550
if we you were a bit just like the whole

110
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,550
slavery which we got right now I think
we got okay

111
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,949
I don't wanna I don't have something
that is demonstrably working

112
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,350
except for the computer on which is
being one and so

113
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,039
I want yes for the rear working through
that it could be a guy who preferred

114
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,210
understand yes our C if you wanted but
with every other

115
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,508
from you can cite the stuff we have
tried to give me everything does were

116
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,690
so I do want people who are yet have a
good building things

117
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,400
doing stuff furriers I'm I have you want
to hurt both of us

118
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,650
I'm raise the money you know it's always
easier to get

119
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,080
more money you've got the meeting today
so we that

120
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,479
behind me I get going your shake the
habit other

121
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,620
and is to save you from this guy to make
it used to be with me or something that

122
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,009
at you this is look I already have

123
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,630

me on that

129
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,419
as the Sun statements yeah Elijah

135
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,189
very specific position

136
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,250
yeah it was ok but what what the is
there for the rest of us come we've got

freedom to pursue the thing that they
think they're gonna

148
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,830
something that knows I'm gonna have to
figure something at the end is a need to
