1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,090
really nice or you just like to follow
talk to you later the problem is the

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,850
case is really

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,520
I

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,780
a what you told me you

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,470
I'm ever so

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,710
well crew hearing that

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,130
all you can you talk a faction public I
miss you may also view

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,690
know what hospitals are I'll best love
you

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,030
however I you should do introductions
with or without issue that we're talking

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,900
about so great about was

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,360
or versus I was using parking lot yeah

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,720
for everybody else poppers all-important

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,910
positive is for for the help of are I'm

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,699
the same we use that he is right to your
place is

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,390
yet to be testing question

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,550
who use poppers today your up

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,000
so you can just leave it here bernie is
that possible

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,740
all these years small although that's
that's cause of time

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,890
all a overs on

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,990
known to go to the hospital I'm

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,000
hmm way talk of possible is it possible
security use these things we've been on

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,610
the phone off and you see what your

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,929
I'll although i guess im all I can see
is

24
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:34,910
wherein the university has access to the
server UK

25
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,100
quietly the server for some big plays

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,740
time is that drive password for I
thought

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,160
that sorta yessir so it's not that came
his way to pick up

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,399
times and I think that is all I it s

29
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,399
are wealth for all easily

30
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,690
um cultural life resident evil stuff
that went by so

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,250
he is a time-based parents live I'm

32
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,979
we r both games the best talk are
so-called

33
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,090
of I'm getting yes that's the case when
he is a risk it all for me is that he's

34
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,580
for verifying calls for his know the on
this computer

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,130
either because the poppers Davies the by

36
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,170
0 wrong um my eyes closed

37
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,670
your World Cup see let's create

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,739
angry up that here said

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,660
Dr on the premise that was very few
Catherine

40
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,750
I'll apart from that I was miles you

41
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,050
I'm so what about the police then he it
was 32 years possibly most

42
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,820
in their fight against that or
undertaking harvesting group

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,280
this is a situation we have information
and if you think a group of us are

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,310
on to %uh over his guesses you

45
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,880
every buildings people you don't know
better and I'm

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
so better for kids um

47
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,120
how r moles are here it is impossible to
sing for

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,380
sometime we do public improvements and I
think

49
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,230
more so that he tables with me no

50
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,459
ok both my vote YES on all this stuff
try to motivate and display

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,720
what they mean behaviors that what I
guess

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,050
possibly or a greasy I'm St my right
here

53
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,040
and the main question is how can be
ordered

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,980
possible did using likelihood basically

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,179
estimating the possibilities anticipated
use my estimate from

56
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,770
we have a update working this or
something he said

57
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,900
Posterous from this calm fears causes

58
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,950
to K the up from his was

59
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,329
but the best thing that we can get
better though most people

60
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,500
Posterous from dead his so that doesn't
really work want to sell it follows

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,800
in the rocking this is the following um
we have public services for

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,010
faulty and your number up yet

63
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,010
fuel differences for or i've seen

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,459
I J now the question is is there wasn't
much reason why there's

65
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:18,269
no for softball 1990 and why we don't
know for sure

66
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,750
up know what the truth there's no
specific reason

67
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,190
so in all likelihood always Hosmer's

68
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,520
true the all about the same I was good

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,960
however for subsidies reading so

70
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,989
says so say welcome nineteen day

71
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,050
dever few via yes into raising all over

72
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,749
estimate of probabilities on that
Rockies

73
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,080
favorite guess that's the vid me

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,680
now we either way he's

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,770
generalize the observation that you from
the rockies

76
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,740
and the way we do with his using marvels

77
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,969
now one step before

78
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,810
%uh cock to Marvel's we can move
although

79
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,300
though probably did you see the
pollsters possibly

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,259
as the whole sequence of values to 32 GB

81
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,509
from your first ever recipient then the
probability that

82
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,199
given the authors there's p and that's
what the name

83
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
and saw through service as in that first

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,749
are PA and saw itself as a way of

85
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:32,960
problem yet probably know that baby

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,568
running be helped because however this
is me

87
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,180
estimate bet for fifty years of as
difficult as

88
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,349
me that companies about the so Knobbe
Martens Olson said yes that s

89
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:50,279
these probabilities can be approximated
by with his movies

90
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,689
do this for history and he said

91
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:57,379
for three grams mutated esteemed

92
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,499
is 302 so I'm

93
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:04,309
and you can't be right there as a person
case from as follows:

94
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:07,999
probably because we're is the
probability of UK

95
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:11,009
this author's lived together that

96
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,680
yes follows yeah that's the same issue
and then be

97
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,909
growth hearsay stuff probably should

98
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:22,029
yes follows anas the rosa

99
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,089
W follows up with and so on investor
presentation

100
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,379
is not really the probability that he
got here

101
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,680
tomorrow some success is about to say

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,879
yes we're here based on and

103
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,479
people that live here is that he's
probably his

104
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,979
are way easier to learn from these up
and September

105
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,449
up to say five grams reliable from

106
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,449
the rockies or models with this so

107
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,289
models is just the way he knows maybe
the probabilities

108
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:01,490
%eh exists for us probably because it
yes hands

109
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,400
that's kind of the general forget up up
for our free and slow

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,539
and the

111
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,210
just how weak they were these or we
estimate

112
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,460
ohs these comes with probabilities

113
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,609
faith piece of the cops all the

114
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,869
in time and Ronald divided

115
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:26,479
by you columns of the

116
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,669
christie's so all that hard here

117
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,068
example up

118
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,319
the house for W followed PDAs

119
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,819
is the probability always the um

120
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,990
providing the columns file pa.--business

121
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,449
W body the

122
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,249
for us yes up on anything

123
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,520
your the company's old a fees

124
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,960
as ever he waved to me use more never
take means

125
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,799
holes smoothing I'll talk about that
here there's

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,460
they plus one supposing which has wars

127
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,688
account is uru up by anywho

128
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,460
their way war on okay always

129
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,799
falling five grams 4075

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,949
I was too little tho geishas

131
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,949
you for that because

132
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,879
not be for example if we

133
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,430
%uh three grams from about roaches

134
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,399
see bass well first text of progress

135
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,210
um we use although

136
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,450
these three rules you over Hawaii

137
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,870
and slow and now you see that only

138
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,089
this group is the law be long time in
eight times that

139
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,250
sees I think house for these three
brothers

140
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,150
are pretty much the same which he is
that the probability is

141
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,390
for me estimations Facebook schools for
these three

142
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,090
offers or basically I think people

143
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,100
that has been hired as I over

144
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,750
but with no get what 90s activity that

145
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,030
almost gave he said disease are

146
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,130
as spicy as Java

147
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,130
and its kinda you phase you of course

148
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,170
no we won't use very almost home now

149
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,579
or possibly getting for missus up oscars

150
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,630
head 5 PLC some words

151
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,220
on house use personal information of
getting

152
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,770
based on for both yes you comes through
the rest the whole

153
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,230
rhythm another baseline getting

154
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,050
column Halloween hoopla for guessing
I'll

155
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,240
we head to head with possible you that

156
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,440
if you were to get a possible to verify
password: and you start

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,400
over with his is incorrect

158
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,560
no let's talk will concentrate are

159
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,739
the first are guessing the house first
up

160
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,860
very often so it was very fun housewares
all hoster said he was no test

161
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,840
are to blame where does that leave us
feel good soaking

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,020
very distinct power I'll Sr there many
war

163
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,300
ways that they want people to know that
everything I do

164
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,609
we concentrated on federalists against
the Posterous

165
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,740
with Merkel's fees for on

166
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,240
problems up um

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,920
based on Marvel's that's what miles no

168
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,199
I as far as I know this implement in
southern burger

169
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,430
a the movies markle moles up correct me
if I'm wrong

170
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,949
crucial with him and he said be there
was over something very similar

171
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,290
um what they do is baby

172
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,180
anyways all house for sale are or not I
was doing that sir

173
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,089
thresholds that means you business
schools

174
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:10,510
the best to be so that your specific
over guest list

175
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,610
and then starting with you passwords
that are more likely

176
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,200
that vessels which is fair enough

177
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,590
um withdrawal that he's you how to
concentrate

178
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,160
%uh there were lines this is the

179
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,719
guessing success of that mode

180
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,030
and yes a priests fail I'm here

181
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,689
%uh yess because we are open to possible
so that moves out for

182
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,760
posner's being fun order I'll

183
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,510
ordered on everybody so in revenue over

184
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,680
events like the Posterous sometimes

185
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,079
papasito you because if he threatens

186
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,900
year we it won't be attending guesses

187
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,160
trillion of assets this text has been
stroking my space and some physical

188
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,910
postures

189
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,500
analysts are the similar

190
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,370
and I was dead yes all pocket

191
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,550
and observer live

192
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,199
rule talkable it sometimes

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,180
no on purpose compares very is that we
found a way to look out for

194
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,969
vs the right over and definitely call

195
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,390
oldham I'll all those marked with great
service

196
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,480
for Ruth or and ago

197
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,720
and I was sOooo how to love it

198
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,160
for us Poor's 500 worse

199
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,469
he do some free sandwiches kinda

200
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,000
or is it the same as are mostly this
word

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,070
we this class focuses with the which
means that we are

202
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,530
me few days from sears one years old

203
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,670
advice as the signal you we are choosing

204
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,969
for others so that we have our I'm yet

205
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,180
pappas we call them levels

206
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,349
although and the most lively

207
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,820
for who he is level 10 fuel

208
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,370
the next less like these funds low
schools and so on

209
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,900
so we started its euro as the most part
long

210
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,220
and for upwards of two months nothing

211
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,660
that something about 30 a good year have
nice things

212
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,670
does the better

213
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,180
and what are we doing that same reason
as are does

214
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,599
let's hope this helps you up by hoover

215
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,930
and these things the bus what follows

216
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,449
now that the over we on

217
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,590
up wheaties

218
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,530
RF overall levels you know which is the
most likely that I'll

219
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,660
then removed of course use those funds
low miles too

220
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,060
must go on up to my office that he

221
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,839
whatever then we are

222
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,950
building vectors a because it was

223
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,760
a 128k miles 10 %uh so that all those

224
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,270
or small able to 0 up to

225
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,819
and pick some up to current level we are
you ready

226
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,870
about you then we ought to be

227
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,490
also group that level 10 we his all

228
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,920
me was this the school's and has been

a vision for a central AV

267
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,400
was level cyril AB followed by

268
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,130
a has those yellow circus

269
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,490
that best fit for loves you

270
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,730
standards that the horse leveled Bonsall

271
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,650
now we have through vectors yes that's
fine

272
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,760
that warm here basis of two farms 10

273
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,908
and these forms you on ultimately it's
good months

274
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:24,209
well through and fuel mines while

275
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,740
now the Toolroom this is the one slow
this exact Daisy

276
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,090
we right here you're trying to find
messing

277
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,639
and red festivals you and we'll see

278
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,830
that hmm there is action on because

279
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,020
a following AZ is my soul it because
mines

280
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,500
on so there's know who possível

281
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,300
that case and then you can see you again
you

282
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,940
to to gramm's that miss cyril

283
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,710
and see following a

284
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,830
that's about it guess call us

285
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,429
the following a the mines love

286
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,870
and also sets for whom

287
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,050
a the as the months-long

288
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,200
so i think is that was the end of course
cause a

289
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,610
miles to move on FB Harrison St

290
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,800
my slow last month long and

291
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,220
old funds to so you're seemed on course

292
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,990
to leave maybe not guess

293
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,020
hmm

294
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,559
so you he's a good guy you know who
first s3

295
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,820
case you you get here delivered to us

296
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,200
anything is there

297
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,170
we are possibly closer to you both but
apart from that

298
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,110
we are here already he decreasing or
vice versa

299
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,340
that's good making because now

300
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,620
we had a result the other miles I'll

301
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,020
because they're getting like possibly
with the King yes a

302
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,150
will us better getting really the
beginning

303
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,450
and I'll are on sale process

304
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,930
and then of course became custom what
causes that

305
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,309
arms you these times

306
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,220
me too your unions up at the same

307
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,980
point because or although

308
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,040
are meant to bring all offers there are
more like

309
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,180
threshold that we are to me that

310
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,110
at that point as well so why was there a
difference between those lines here

311
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,699
%uh one reason is that our audience
approach

312
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,710
yes committed themselves to goals

313
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,290
we was three drives the weekend slightly
better approximation

314
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,950
immunity Marlins three draws

315
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,840
those songs food me here if that was the
point

316
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,610
there's a because it was like to live
together Omar

317
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,429
theory bases using on you

318
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,890
that means that we are way they were in
the meantime

319
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,260
so your I'll you

320
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,590
good then there's I'm another

321
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,309
possibly guesser up by that time a piece
of political issue driver's

322
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,490
which is basically has your to your
movie

323
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,040
um I'm

324
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,250
were here I'll

325
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,929
annuals thats for sorry up a video that
I made for dinner

326
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,230
venues from paid up and

327
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,030
your server the following day the
dataset

328
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,379
I'll many wise grows to slow the very
beginning

329
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,160
persevere that's all it is recruit year

330
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,380
is a city seeing how is it was for loses

331
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,830
that both line year he was there

332
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,710
on up than any other ones

333
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,590
I'll and US leader the Marvel

334
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,620
operation case there is close

335
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,030
and most other reason for that arms
problem

336
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,690
the house for structured some says it's
a bit

337
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,100
Marble Falls or goes for sure because
we're

338
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,370
Soviet Army heroes for grants

339
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,439
if you care about XVI

340
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,780
yeah housewares a hot because there is
reason for space games music or

341
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,379
wellesley and quieter on

342
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,520
he can't have who heads the beginning
and the end

343
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,210
possibly because he's is a retired
structure

344
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,679
and thank you very wasn't on I was able
to talk

345
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,670
can be combined with its wide use for
those pictures you're the structure that

346
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,870
would be a buzz

347
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,870
being grew hearing yo

348
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,699
Cody and better you

349
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,590
unisom

350
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,850
whose own I was a bit vs

351
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,260
moving he is instances running I'll

352
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,730
however it is researchers grades code

353
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,890
palm my know what it means

354
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,220
be the reason is that the only or we're
excuse as the musical

355
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,090
this you think it is you groove and

356
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,100
yeah trying to get and defender up

357
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,139
who is %uh we're more than with me

358
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,679
have a good but so way for

359
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,920
next year say worry mars losing

360
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,950
hmm good now we know how to

361
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,790
guess possible sufficiently I'm
knowledge think I'm

362
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,050
only 10 effect against somebody Kzoo

363
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,280
customers and volleyball was our proved
to me that this little

364
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,559
as he's way better there commonly used
I'll

365
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,660
possible rules that is up there I'll I'm
going to tell you this is working on the

366
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,590
site as well

367
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,449
%uh they're busy with this %uh he's the
one who

368
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,929
or all offers to obtain letters and
numbers

369
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,360
that the outcome is what you think apart
from

370
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,059
ABC 123 want to be seein impostors

371
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,379
is as pretty the structure they want him
to

372
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,400
exception as well a because the

373
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,309
spas is to split anyway also the most
composers Hector

374
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,649
I'll score so possibly consisting of

375
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,820
you at home randomly chosen long as
there's

376
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,760
as we you do they have not mentioned
here he is he

377
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,290
which is way worse goes other possible
was

378
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,590
up the possible urged with careful a

379
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,678
at and see rules at all what's
considered

380
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,970
strong I'll you those wavy hair

381
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,950
ball smokers yes legal want to do is
walk out of my house

382
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,870
yes and that's fine with me as a
infrastructure

383
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,100
last month driver I'll

384
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,299
or Orleans season up and I don't was

385
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,190
awesome army strong universal 10 he

386
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,280
its who boots are ideal also

387
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,590
what will be also possibly said her

388
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,689
and you might think that his wife knew
that if any

389
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,450
maybe is I'll thought i think is useful

390
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,860
and maybe we can get that so-called
comfort zone with just you

391
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,379
as is seeking trade discussions
regarding that point

392
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,710
with a baby multiple Posterous think
nearly impossible possible

393
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,240
center is the one that offers corporate
issuers you might see the house was

394
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,130
into your pasta is like the best horse
loans the

395
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,440
much for his up his though it's gorgeous

396
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,920
I'm that's what political

397
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,929
up businesses how he helped me

398
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,280
my viewers I'll Spurs and

399
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,470
good base that on a little banged up
thought that bob with my stupid

400
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,559
sometimes

401
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,629
he has on the site actually I'll

402
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,790
my arrival time and so long

403
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,920
so what you are casa proposing

404
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,980
is who confused for this

405
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,440
you your base lovers yes

406
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,820
wrong group password database

407
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,870
always easy it is to enhance a group
faces

408
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll which is entirely correct because
the only positive plate and computer is

409
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,320
is probably very right here against
everything that we

410
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,480
teach yes so

411
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,730
what do you say here still

412
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,390
up because the form below today they say
because of course there is

413
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,530
is more like to meet you to the review
yes that

414
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,790
up and let me use various

415
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,440
strong poppers are pretty good potent
healer wonderful

416
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,010
I'll think that possibility with this
problem is you

417
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,080
before so that's not it I'll

418
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,919
in the end of the committee's I'll
business what's up

419
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,220
from the fifth both love you he says
those

420
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,429
years he's fuzzy zoeller once

421
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,040
and you just the those five pressed save
it together

422
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,610
his so you have to first base in bed

423
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,169
european-style trousers beer more
affected by

424
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,429
European Communities that we once

425
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:41,500
which is very unfortunate situation

426
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,890
also the we have observed paths

427
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,410
only skewing olson with you I'll

428
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,720
a used reasonable behavior I was always

429
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,510
wonderful that's awesome to a problem

430
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,540
yes we do have to prove it everywhere
else

431
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,820
I'll your crew bad you yeah a threat as

432
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,820
and wonderful I time if we had about
going to miss

433
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,879
baby prove that house to marry

434
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,130
in all information the from that house
would you please

435
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,750
forever professional this I'll once and
for all that here in st.

436
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,190
interested at the same time weekend

437
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,309
so we demonstrate for case very few

438
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,370
receive does grades too much for a

439
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,370
Voice so hang on I'll yet

440
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,110
so we thought he is a pussy um

441
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,418
I'll show you to sluts weeks however
they are

442
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,030
that one you know pollitt wavy

443
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,350
threshold for who he is because it does
appear

444
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,899
moral that probably two months yes if
you are the others is weakness

445
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,340
you upgrade will you

446
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,570
and we classified oscars to

447
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,580
strong we at this is the

448
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,210
up %uh charms

449
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,440
false-positive and throughput israelis

450
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,380
how to eat that across the rest of the
world is own is your

451
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,000
assigning a rental able to use possibly
you're hanging out here

452
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
on the I don't know you can see this

453
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,270
is and a as the others

454
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,080
I'm god bless you Rs the previews those

455
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,379
no you Ultimo us lose you

456
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,820
would be here the optimal solution we
have to see you

457
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,070
also halted and 100 percent true
positive rate

458
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,840
our destination a sophomore fine grabs
this is online

459
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,280
you is good yeah that's it wasn't your

460
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,139
you really only until that points
they're still cleaning those

461
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,330
optimal solution and both of us

462
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,580
you could performance

463
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,780
and yes that's true the dependency on

464
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,379
the actual size using we

465
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,669
always year but that

466
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,100
for his friend the via and

467
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,250
up as against love you because you did
using

468
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,700
possibly from different cited mmm

469
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,179
excuses that city his you performance

470
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:34,179
mmm-hmm fun

471
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,100
you really matters obscure information
with companies

472
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,149
all the renzo you was the

473
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,760
up with Oscar is friend I'll his father

474
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,049
similar polo year is for

475
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:51,389
on the five boroughs computing and nice
his

476
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:57,020
Mon with the boys and it was like what
that's like this because it's a

477
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,720
yes up the estimation based upon by was
okay good

478
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,860

and rubs angry you love that is the

502
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,640
who's like the work you increase about

information

504
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,870
