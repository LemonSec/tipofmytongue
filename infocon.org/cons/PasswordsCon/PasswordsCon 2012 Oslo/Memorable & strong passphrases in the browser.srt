00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,679
choose

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,390

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,400
words football bowls review

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,380
possibles so we generate

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,099
a sequences of

56
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,939
32 the concerned indigents this week
transformed words

57
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,359
way that you can go boxes to us

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,519
by the way this is war

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,040
so how does it

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,599
ok you want that way

64
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,849
to up predictable strength

65
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,170
round on passwords

66
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,478

77
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,950
the we uses the possible so it

78
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,039
32 be example is

79
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,260

the number in this my vs 96 p

84
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,500
weirdness that's three times is to
triplets

85
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,240
is through its so what not words what's
another example

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,570
you salute go home sizes

87
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,960

89
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,860
jus here what's his name there for the
chosen is

90
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,440
a it's a very small the other days

91
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,150
souls and wrong the most shoes

92
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,099
words in wanted more importantly so

93
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,550
supposedly hopefully these are like
memorably were

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,889
with words let you that made up the
story itself

95
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,380
well they doing follow-up

96
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,870
are 96 speedster night

97
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,440
this is the to so you choose

98
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,479
a bizarre mister you one for jews and
then you have like 35 way

99
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,310
of rumors that you can remember we
haven't really tried to tell

100
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,660
we're hoping it's a much strong way of
creating

101
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,289
impossible's so that's the disposal this
from

102
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,349
I'm this is

103
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,370
yeah 32 over three

104
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,889
is your vote table people since States

105
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,780
Wenger beeper forward over

106
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,429
to say since 2005 for the entire house
to raise

107
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,949
or about to for a few minutes

108
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:06,229
so this is how it works

109
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,250
right so we 640 you can service

110
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,199
these are the three indices

111
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,130
in addition a as you take the desert
mozhno

112
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,930
and its it really bothered by him up the
tree was one of the most well

113
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,539
news we do the same forces Luther

114
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,190
so you end up who is the triplet

115
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,330
and then if you wanna go via

116
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,840
its exactly the same thing just like we
were still function

117
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,909
so you have a in this were

118
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,259
given so did worse will love user

119
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,419
all I have to do is to find the induces

120
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,698
then from today's a particular number

121

at five assists a four fumbles

166
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,160
it's already done basically so if this
is 15

167
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,260
role will buy a powerful stuff sposa
from whose

168
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:15,580
us through otherwise it's the yeah

169
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,790
persons

170
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,079

171
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,229
the trip was you about

172

173
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,590
wandering the triples so forming

174
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,370
something

175
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,890
his you freeze usually from

176
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,589
true well this is yet will be but it is

177
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,990
this is the worst so overall red

178
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,070
yes if they argue over who struggle ok
so

179
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,490
so I

180
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,620
use generates a few there are too many
times I'm

181
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,610
legendary just want to know but we very
rarely makes sense

182
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,870
but they are settlement would you coming
up so

183
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,330
through the Met Your Number 23 were

184
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,690

185
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,100
X's the desert 32-bit way

186
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,810
verse aimed at its in the dictionary

187
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,619
over the first word the truth is its
large

188
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,420
good than you think it's the one million

189
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,140
whom I was good for the sort of because

190
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,939
littler as you series 1626 which

191
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,730
to gives you just double 232

192
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,320
to make them off work no

193

so funny

194
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,690
school just under doesn't work it so

195
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,959
think it's very hard when you come
examples furor

196
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,130
to that only makes sense to you to find
some other

197
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,070
nation position to say you know

198
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,690

199
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,040
a massive number that you have 15

205
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,850
