1
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,610
much of the new york password cracker
performs

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,669
you

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,380
does the wrongfulness of house for
truckers need more power

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,299
yes real we need more power subs bomb

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,189
it is getting his load out to sea views
do things like QPR

6
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,369
UTI closers you cracking a Fargo

7
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:36,650
uses to that song River I'll pseudogenes

8
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,540
budget are persecuting to revolutionize
the way to be certain look

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,300
yet up massacre little goldfish

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,379
bustles orgy use rosa

11
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,400
you how did you use word up G views

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,930
a bitch user not no never exactly like
this

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,159
fun after exactly but there's a
potential solutions Louis

14
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,799
run gives the look we can build up so we
build up

15
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,799
music you seal system or stuff it
follows much

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,510
she views as K there are certain laws
that have systems at a 79-77

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,710
of for that we're doing life you know

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,960
ok what 69 items a GP's max was more
look at that

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,179
a GP numbers discuss the last november
revises

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,890
that baby carriage driver supported up
until his most recent release

21
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,109
so we're doing everything we can to
build your sis's up to be the magic

22
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,699
number

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,460
a GPS system the problem is also
expensive as hell

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,048
and we had all sorts of problems with
certain mold spores will support the

25
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,159
cheek use

26
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,729
setting fires that have a PCIe to space
the sport is you

27
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,450
use its whatever so only supported each
key pieces

28
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,950
pass that look would you want to go
before the issue use

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,409
so solutions that is circled impels
civilian one single box as easy to use

30
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,850
so doing up multiple boxes that have
three or four GB use

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,119
was serving low- to give it a problem
right

32
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,159
is also two-plus seasons ball should
crack work which she were

33
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,200
call ever virtual Okies yeah

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,089
I'm assuming at this point everyone's a
winner open sea of love for

35
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,630
that allows general purpose computing 13
much radio devices not just you

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,940
used also PGA cindy is peace such
virtual

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,299
still is exactly what's up the slow to
use appears if you look at each

38
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,140
use it it was the entire don't see a
local said

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,179
was great number on so University

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,080
as should you buy most expensive you've
been a closer business last 20 years

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,760
probably heard the name rosa

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,518
the CO was a few Bros

43
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,720
it's free freezes free beer right

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
this is forcing all open co-vice as much
as you

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,900
use it worse is if I'm also open sea
Ella

46
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,450
that's not exactly the case this was I
the most recent version of PCL

47
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,890
does not work because the big bug in the
AUD STK

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,099
however I'll for our purposes

49
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,569
uses internet to work around that
doesn't ask access no longer pulse

50
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,119
I've just been told about an hour ago
the CWC

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,489
merced that supposedly works on this as
well but

52
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,310
we have not tested that's a lot of
couples Paul movie so completely lose

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,120
the complex you should be load

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,040
and is clustered did use these the
problems are as close source

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,569
close license and yes you can edit it we
can distribute it

56
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,670
so figures like backtracked and %uh get
into some other distributions they can

57
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,328
create like

58
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,659
for example the sea life seasons two
days a week he says

59
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,439
goals RV still for all intents and
purposes

60
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,489
are made for I'll lowers you know i
misteri clusters

61
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,920
the political %uh Educational Scientific
department probably what you guys have

62
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,359
your

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,390
University I'll they only have water is

64
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,040
for 64-bit Linux know which is why there
is no third you once

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,519
sued and we need a high-speed let me so
i cn

66
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,189
yes RVC oh you're not doing it I don't
close friend

67
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:15,560
so those you have your mind creating a
large worldwide

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,070
botnet it's not happy with the CL yet
with the next %uh solution

69
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,480
so how does the co-worker alright
improvises sure

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,990
all devices drugs whoever holds your
mobile application have

71
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,550
is the provision there yeah it was a for
the most part aside what we just talked

72
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,920
about the fucking latest AMD STK

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,580
on the application is not a few where he
co-owns the world CO

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,260
yes basis you learn more your broker
knows what size is that you did

75
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,120
you know pvs rover no excuses girls love
you know so you can view does

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,310
to keep yea

77
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,620
yeah so the rumor know this for fun

78
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,410
this is worse of course that doesn't
stop in this was the talk with over in

79
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,480
past that supports other brokers were
processed every song

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,480
you only yeah BC library over do you
install

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,910
ya BA BCom class you don't need any
drivers install headed so for all

82
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,870
intents and purposes

83
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,310
said you know your program ok to be a
personal machine up

84
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,460
to use small setup awesome he is a
strong enough word

85
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,849
just that you know sacking

86
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,230
you don't need to install your open sea
horse offer on the back at home he is

87
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,090
the co-author

88
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,150
maybe even and open silly voices and
prices are driving to the results show

89
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,849
the buses over talking about

90
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,780
anti-radiation ok you think on you CCL

91
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:44,229
yes he tells us all iraq Susan single
piece organza

92
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,830
businesses yes broker know here this one
year out

93
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,810
worse with your host CPU processor does
a affair

94
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,260
for Moses overall Cebu process is gonna
be yours of course that this is hacked

95
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,870
I'll justice the co-worker

96
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,150
brokers you talk to the back in the
morning if you know it's

97
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,659
was your course full performed fewer
horses on good so

98
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,310
license you also also or just so you can
have the broker running on a computer

99
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,490
miss social we do with our clothes car
that will be more

100
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,830
but this is a process except for you

101
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,010
both broker and you can see all the men
running on you know that there really is

102
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,900
no

103
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,250
hovered over you know does it work

104
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,640
its special workflow here

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,659
missus the workflow estimate was hatched
fucc

106
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,280
with passion pass to Greg really also do

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,590
is movie network issues are executed
gonna look to russia is going to give us

108
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,520
back in force

109
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,150
from your room there's a few minutes you

110
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,260
now PCL sociological super see all that
needs no of musicians

111
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,580
the seattle also see will call multiple
executions

112
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,580
dress file i/o no silly offers AC
researchers with

113
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,400
Road so no visions for super skills to
make

114
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,890
one call to view those you guys think
your curls

115
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,950
yet ready access to local filesystem
loser look to be said

116
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,479
that's right the stark contrast here

117
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,490
we have a listed phone back and forth
broker to the computer which was

118
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,530
executed lease terms

119
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,989
was to hear yeah low latency Lisa
execute his car was really fast is too

120
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,910
fast ashes ITV 5 2011

121
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,240
talking about you know hundreds of
billions criminalist uses a sec it's you

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,550
really lovely and sweet with you putes

123
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,630
in this mall you're super CL you don't
need to adhere to the broker

124
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,740
you know what through the computer file
system

125
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,640
gonna have to pass a sufficient you know
I okay with their so you really doing a

126
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,900
super silly should be in with the sleazy
beats

127
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,770
from communications in the broader if
you know subpoenas bosses that shit is a

128
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,740
local businesses here

129
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,110
yeah now is the party what a wonderful

130
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,300
I wish I use PCR with asset alright

131
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,280
as our mission you soon I did he still
supports up to 128 you use it was the

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,460
last step closer than 0.9

133
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,770
K yeah

134
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,500
0 and process because the ABS the gate
is broken

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,030
listeners with the CEO I'll for you to
myself

136
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,659
very extensive conversations with up and
I'm

137
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,440
Moses and they were more than happy to
help people issues once they realize we

138
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,110
did not return the world to do

139
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,990
password cracking book you yeah

140
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,610
this is a key considerations that the
monthly jump right in its sole UCO

141
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,180
or Daewoo brute force is not exactly
very little bit

142
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,279
book a worthless attacks you get a lot
of it was just trestles

143
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,610
does worthless you're talking most this
year qualifies you for this right

144
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,250
your choice for those will world this is
real time two years if you gots

145
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,089
latency slow ass isn't always so lazy to
the Colonels take one with sq

146
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:07,360
that's just not hard a bit slow so

147
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,199
0 you can talk about different also
super C O

148
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,469
at this point has stepped on a super cs4
so your communications with a broken

149
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,920
nose

150
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,750
and your few notes and low-latency
high-bandwidth

151
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,959
November the broker no needs a cracked I
don't know

152
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,250
if you're move asap yes the dash in
value was sure %uh

153
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,480
acceleration which gives so before
