1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
and just uh stay put because now we are

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,279
heading straight for christian brown

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,000
from google to talk about pas keys

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
and after that we're also doing the uh

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
panel on all things fido where we have

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,440
both fido alliance we have microsoft and

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
we have google up here if you have any

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
questions related to that you can ask

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
that while we go ahead with the panel

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,039
discussion you can tweet at me if you

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,119
want on twitter and i will ask the

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,240
question anonymously on your behalf but

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,599
prepare your questions for that

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
and while chrysalis getting ready

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
i can do some of my old jokes like

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,680
my ex-wife is probably

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
the woman in the world who knows most

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
against her password about passwords

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,399
against your own will

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,120
a pin walks into a bar and the bartender

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,519
says what

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,120
you're too short to be here obviously

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,000
yeah

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,879
um

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,200
i i i have a little uh

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,119
thing with christian um

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,240
i was doing passers-con in stockholm in

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
2018

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,880
i was incredibly happy to see that

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,960
christian from google

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
submitted the talk he wanted to come and

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
talk about

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,479
fido stuff

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,200
and being the person i am i was thinking

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
about well

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
so christian is coming to talk about

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
fido and uh

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
you know i've been up and down talking

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
about fido before as well

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
so i figured how to best welcome

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
christian to scandinavia to stockholm

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,320
and sweden

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
so i created a t-shirt

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
uh saying what do we still have in 10

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
years from now

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
passwords

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
or web or then

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
so we have a 10 year bat between the two

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,600
of us

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
luca

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
buys a beer for the other one

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
what do we still have in 10 years from

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,880
now christian i'm really looking forward

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
weboven related initiatives for

71

almost a decade now

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
this is the year i feel like i said that

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,040
every year now this really is the year

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
and

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
i think what i'm going to try and do

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
here is go through

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
um a little bit of background on like

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,000
what we've been doing you know i think

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
the

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
presentation is officially titled like

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
you know where we are where we've been

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,879
and where we're going um and then we'll

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,599
lead into a q a with a panel where some

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
of my other colleagues on the fighter

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
side will join me um if folks have any

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
any questions and we can have a healthy

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
discussion uh before we get into that

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
though i just want to make sure that

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,599
i have

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,760
my

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
logistics figured out i am planning to

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
do a live demo which is always a lot of

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
fun especially for the people in the

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,560
audience when it doesn't work um so i

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
think we're good i think we've got

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,120
everything ready and when we get to that

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
part of the presentation hopefully we

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
should be able to to do that without too

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,799
much trouble uh i'm gonna plug this in

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,239
two

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
just gonna make sure don't wanna set up

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
my keyboard no

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
and hopefully we should be

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
good to go all right excellent cool um

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
can folks still hear me if i'm walking

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
around here no

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,319
let me clip this on my t-shirt up here

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,360
let's see if that's better that's okay

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
folks in the back all right excellent

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,920
great okay um so again i'm christian and

111
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,720
we're gonna be talking a little bit

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
about pass keys today so let's start

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
with why we're doing this work right

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
what is the reason why we got involved

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
in this in the first place um back in

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
2009 um google suffered a

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
um an attack uh very similar actually to

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
what has happened just two or three days

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,880
ago with some other vendors um basically

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
google got phished right um there was a

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
phishing email phishing message someone

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,440
clicked on it uh gave away credentials

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,280
and hey you know someone got into the

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,800
system um and that same thing happened

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
recently and it still happens and it

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,720
really is because passwords are so

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
incredibly easy to fetch right it is so

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,199
trivial in tricking a user into

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
revealing their secret data the thing

130
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
that is supposed to make them unique so

131
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,680
easy for them to reveal that to you know

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
some other resource um and and to be

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
quite honest it's much easier to set up

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,639
a website and exploit phishing than it

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,680
is to exploit you know uh i guess the in

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
inherent protection in systems today

137
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
that come as a result of malware

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
protection right um if we think back

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,960
like a number of years ago if you look

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
at this graph right back in 2012 2013

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
2014 the way that you would pop someone

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
is by getting malware on their system um

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
no one does that nowadays right for two

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
reasons fishing is super easy to pull

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
off and secondly operating systems have

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
become much better at isolation um and

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
just in general at keeping bad and

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
unwanted software out apple app store is

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,320
one way uh you know very curated uh

150
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
google play store kind of similar and

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
even on other desktop operating systems

152
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
the operating systems have become much

153
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,680
much much better at ensuring that bad

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
software and unwanted software stays out

155
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,639
so phishing is the one thing that we

156
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,440
want to protect against uh back to the

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
the short history here 2009 uh you know

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
this stuff happened and we vowed that we

159
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
don't want phishing and credential

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,759
phishing to ever be a problem for google

161
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,520
enterprise users or google internal

162
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
users again um

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
and that's really where our journey the

164
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
google journey started um towards the

165
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,800
stuff that i want to talk about here

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
today which is uh fido and and pass keys

167
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,960
and web authent um so we wanted to find

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,479
a solution to this problem so a bunch of

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,600
different companies got together right

170
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,199
this isn't an exhaustive list this is a

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,840
couple of names uh of folks that's part

172
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
of this thing called the fido alliance

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,039
and i'm sure folks in this audience have

174
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,639
probably all about the photo alliance

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,919
it's a bunch of us that came together

176
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,360
and we said hey we want to solve this

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,160
problem uh we have this phishing problem

178
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
we have usability problems we've got

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
other problems we want to you know band

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
together and we want to try and address

181
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
this uh problem going forward

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
and what we came up with is something

183
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
called and in the next slide you'll see

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,080
a little bit of a different explanation

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
of this but we came up with something

186
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
called web of n web authentication uh

187
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,479
and it's w36 w3c worldwide web

188
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
consortium specification

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
that allows

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
developers or web developers to interact

191
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
with security hardware and security

192
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
implementations on platforms and we'll

193
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
talk a little bit more about what that

194
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,080
means in a second but basically there's

195
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,039
the world wide web consortium um who has

196
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
the specification for a lot of this work

197
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
and then there is the fido alliance

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
which is the organization um in which a

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,240
lot of us operate together and and and

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,919
kind of like came up with some of the

201
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,199
work that ultimately led to the

202
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
specification in the w3c and a different

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
a representation of how that work and

204
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
how these things are related to this

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
graphic here essentially you have fido

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
and fighter 2 502 it's kind of like this

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,919
overarching thing this umbrella uh you

208
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,759
know terminology that sits at the top

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
and then inside of fido 2 you have a web

210
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
specification which is how a developer

211
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
would interact with fido's stuff um you

212
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
know if you write a website essentially

213
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
you'll deal with whatever is in the w3c

214
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
webothen specification uh that's kind of

215
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
like on the right hand side here um and

216
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,639
then if you are a vendor that makes

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
physical security keys right that's

218
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,400
stuff that we'll talk about in a second

219
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
that's part of what we've done in fido

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
physical security keys was the first

221
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,879
instantiation of uh fido hardware and of

222
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
the solution this phishing resistance

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
solution which we'll talk about but

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,599
essentially if you're an authenticator

225
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,680
vendor um then you deal with the

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
standard that sits under the fido

227
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,840
alliance which is called ctap client to

228
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
authenticator protocol for most of us in

229
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
this room if you're not an authenticator

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,080
vendor if you're not interested in

231
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
making physical keys you can ignore most

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
of the parts on the left there but what

233
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
is way more interesting is

234
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
recently we've decided that not only

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
will we under the fido umbrella be

236
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
supporting physical external security

237
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,199
keys things that a user has to buy and

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,320
carry and that they can use to

239
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,559
authenticate but we will also support

240
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
built-in authenticators so stuff that's

241
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
already inside of the platform that can

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
make the platform act and get all the

243
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
benefits of a fido authenticator um

244
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,240
these are things like fingerprint

245
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,560
sensors uh the screen unlock of the

246
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
device face recognition so there's a lot

247
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,120
of this technology that has been in

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,839
devices ever since the advent of the

249
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,480
iphone 5s i guess which is the first

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
real consumer device with a fingerprint

251
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,600
on it i mean before that we had some

252
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
desktop and laptop systems but it never

253
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
really took off this is the first time

254
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
that it became mainstream and when we

255
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
saw that we were like hey it would be

256
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
cool to allow developers to get access

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,959
to that hardware with all of the

258
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
features and all of the benefits that

259
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
fido authentication provides so we'll

260
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,080
talk about that

261
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
so if we look at a quick timeline here

262
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
right we started off with the physical

263
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
removable security key back in 2009 when

264
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
google had our issues when we said hey

265
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,160
we never want to get fished again we um

266
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
designed a protocol which is basically

267
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
what ended up becoming u2f together with

268
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
some other folks that were business and

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,640
fido but u2f universal second factor was

270
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,959
the first instantiation of fido

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
and that is where you use a physical

272
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,959
device most of the time a usb device

273
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,880
that has some key material on it when

274
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,320
you want to sign into a system you

275
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
present this key material and then the

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,959
way that the protocol is constructed the

277
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,279
the uh authentication sequencing is is

278
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,959
phishing resistance so it means even if

279
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,959
you're tricked into going to a website

280
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,720
that's not really the real google or the

281
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,959
real microsoft or the real facebook the

282
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
security key will not reveal its secret

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,160
and that was kind of like one of the big

284
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,640
benefits of of moving into the spider

285
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
world because if you look at other forms

286
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
of multi-factor authentication um pretty

287
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
much none of them except for smart cards

288
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
have the inherent phishing protection

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
that fighter devices have so fighter

290
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
devices brought back in the blue kind of

291
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,279
side on the left it brought um

292
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,640
phishing resistant multi-factor

293
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
authentication to the masses into the

294
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,320
web but we still needed users to go and

295
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
buy physical security keys and you know

296
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
we knew that that had a a very limited

297
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
kind of like

298
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
usable segment there um and then we went

299
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,160
on and we said well it's really cool now

300
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
that the iphone 5 has fingerprint

301
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
sensors and androids fingerprint sensors

302
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,040
and nowadays on laptops and other

303
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
devices uh we have like windows hello

304
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,560
which is a mechanism for doing

305
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
biometrics on the device what if we

306
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,160
could tie that same technology into fido

307
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
um and we can essentially expand from

308
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
only users who buy physical keys to a

309
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
world where anyone that has a hardware

310
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,920
that has these capabilities can also

311
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,200
benefit from

312
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
resistant fido

313
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,279
as kind of like an additional factor

314
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,800
we'll talk about that in a second so

315
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,839
that's kind of like stuff that we've

316
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,040
done back in 2017 2018 um lately we've

317
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
added support for other uh you know

318
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
purpose build flows for example there

319
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
are certain types of financial services

320
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
regulation that came out in europe

321
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
in the u.s we see a lot of specific type

322
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,920
of credit card transaction security

323
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
that's needed stuff called 3d secure so

324
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
we were working together with these

325
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
other

326
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
bodies essentially in saying what can we

327
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,839
do to take fido support that we have and

328
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
bring it to more and more use cases so

329
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
not traditional authentication but other

330
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
types of specialized authentication

331
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
flows as well for example payment flows

332
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
um and and you know that was all great

333
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
but we still had a problem we still have

334
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
this adoption problem where fido was

335
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
kind of like for a minority uh fighter

336
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
was for users with physical security

337
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,320
keys fido was for users or developers

338
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
who um really added fido as an

339
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,639
additional option over and above

340
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,040
passwords but it wasn't really closer to

341
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,279
getting us rid of passwords completely

342
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,959
it was still one more option you could

343
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,880
use if you think back to the biometric

344
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
authentication you have in your phone

345
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
today right if you have a banking app on

346
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,920
your phone most of the time you open the

347
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,760
banking app uh you know you sign in with

348
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
your username and your password and then

349
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
you up step into biometric

350
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,399
authentication the next time you come

351
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,000
back now you can use your fingerprint

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,519
but the moment you buy a new device

353
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
you're back to password authentication

354
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,560
so you're never getting rid of passwords

355
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
you're really adding biometrics and

356
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,399
adding capabilities in order to make

357
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,000
authentication easier and more

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
user-friendly but you're not getting rid

359
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,120
of the security downsides of having a

360
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,639
password attached to that particular

361
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,959
account and that's really where pass

362
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,760
keys came in which isn't really a a

363
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
different specification or a different

364
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
technology it is taking what we have in

365
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
fido and web within and applying it in a

366
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
certain way where we can actually

367
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
finally start hopefully getting rid of

368
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
passwords completely

369
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
and me winning that bet with per and

370
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
getting a bunch of beer so let's talk a

371
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
little bit about that in a second here

372
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
security keys the fob this is the use

373
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,279
case we had first right users go sign in

374
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,880
somewhere you type your username you

375
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
type your password you pull out your

376
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,160
security key you plug it into the drive

377
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
and hey you're magically authenticated

378
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,639
not really a you know a better user

379
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,800
experience than using passwords uh you

380
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
one can argue that it's maybe better

381
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,639
than you know having to use sms otp in

382
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
terms of usability or better than having

383
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,399
to use push because it's easy and the

384
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,079
device is already maybe in your usb port

385
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,839
and you just tap it but it was

386
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
definitely an improvement in security

387
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,279
but it wasn't really an improvement

388
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
usability and it certainly didn't get us

389
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
closer to getting rid of the usability

390
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
issues regarding passwords um platform

391
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,600
authenticators is the thing we did next

392
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
you know as we can see here we saw these

393
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,600
things start to appear in more and more

394
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
devices fingerprint sensor on laptops

395
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
phones uh you know laptops there on the

396
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
left-hand side in terms of the of the

397
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
camera you know

398
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,760
facial recognition um and with that we

399
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
were able to build some interesting web

400
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
experiences and this is a gif that

401
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
should play there we go you should see

402
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,920
this uh working here this is for example

403
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,360
you can see we're on a website right

404
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,519
you're on accounts.google.com and you're

405
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,279
trying to do something where we need

406
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,600
additional assurance that it's you in

407
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
the past we would have asked you to

408
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,959
enter your google password here we say

409
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,079
just touch your fingerprint on the

410
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,000
system and we'll authenticate you not

411
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
really that groundbreaking because apps

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
were able to do this you know since the

413
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,720
iphone 5s but finally with web authent

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
we brought these experiences to the web

415
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,120
so we allowed web developers to also

416
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
make use of the inherent technology

417
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
built into these platforms

418
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
and we had a bunch of relying parties or

419
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
developers supporting these flows paypal

420
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
had some implementations ebay had some

421
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
yahoo japan entity docomo and google and

422
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
a bunch of others um

423
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,959
so actually um i saw an email this

424
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,680
morning uh a colleague of mine um sent

425
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,480
me a screenshot of a yahoo us account

426
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,760
that actually has a similar

427
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
functionality here as well so now i can

428
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,880
probably start removing the jp

429
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,199
designator there under the yahoo side

430
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,040
because it looks like we're still seeing

431
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,839
more and more adoption of this type of

432
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,920
of workflow but like i said this is a

433
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
usability improvement right it's not

434
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
necessarily a security improvement if

435
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,760
your finger is wet as jim said earlier

436
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,199
you still get the fallback right you can

437
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,880
cancel out of this flow and always opt

438
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
for still typing your password there is

439
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,639
no reason why you can't go back to that

440
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,399
what we wanted with fido and ultimately

441
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,000
with webothen is we wanted to move

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
beyond the password we want to end up

443
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,760
with accounts that don't have passwords

444
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
they might not even have usernames so

445
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
the big question is how do we get from

446
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,519
here which is where we were into that

447
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,320
role

448
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
and that's really what we'll be talking

449
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,279
about here so we had a problem with fido

450
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,120
adoption as i said right problem is

451
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
usability right limited consumer

452
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
awareness and usage of security keys um

453
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
you know i can tell you about the

454
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,199
statistics there but as you can imagine

455
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,360
it's not like we see all google users

456
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,880
using security keys i mean we can't even

457
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,199
get all the users to use usb so i mean

458
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,040
and there's there are certain types of

459
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
uh initiatives and things that we have

460
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
where we're trying to push more users to

461
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
take more ownership of account security

462
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
but it's hard when that entails

463
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
physically buying something and carrying

464
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,199
yet another device so we have that

465
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,240
challenge

466
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,079
second one is uh you know challenges

467
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,279
with platform authenticators a second

468
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,600
factor um even as a first factor like i

469
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,320
said we never got rid completely of the

470
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
password we just gave you another option

471
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
and it's great to have more options but

472
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
that doesn't really change the security

473
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,199
paradigm of the security model all that

474
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
much um and then the last one as i said

475
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,959
like high barrier to adoption for users

476
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,440
who need to opt-in to usb i mean we

477
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,279
can't even get used to opt-in to sv how

478
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
do we up them into using technology that

479
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,079
entails an additional step or two or

480
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,079
three steps and you know having to carry

481
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,519
around physical devices and all sorts of

482
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,279
other stuff so these were the problems

483
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,040
and these were really the final limits

484
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,519
back before we started uh in in this uh

485
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,839
engaging in this pass key uh rel

486
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,560
um so what is masking well pesky is a

487
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,639
password replacement that is safer

488
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
easier and faster to use passkey isn't

489
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,560
the brand it's not supposed to be

490
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
capitalized it's now it's like passwords

491
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,480
right you just say hey i have a password

492
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,199
i have a pass key um the idea here is

493
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,920
that this is a word which the industry

494
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,839
can kind of coalesce around it's not an

495
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
apple brand it's not a google brand it's

496
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,880
not a microsoft brand it's not a fido

497
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,439
brand it is just a pass key

498
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,520
which is very very similar to a password

499
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,839
and hopefully in the user's mind um we

500
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,880
can start to create this concept of

501
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
yesterday i used passwords today and

502
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
tomorrow i'm going to be using a pass

503
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,760
key and and we can start to um

504
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,079
essentially help users with the user

505
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
journeys and the changes in user

506
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
behavior that will be needed to support

507
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
the transition to keys and that's what

508
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,120
we'll be talking about here for the next

509
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
couple of minutes

510
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,080
so the capabilities that we get um and i

511
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,760
stole these slides shamelessly from

512
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,880
andrew's deck thank you andrew um so the

513
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
the capabilities that you get in a pass

514
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
key world what is different from

515
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
wimbledon yesterday and fido to pass

516
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,160
keys today well the first one is

517
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,679
remember that problem that i said you

518
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,679
know it's great if you have an app and

519
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,799
you type in your username and your

520
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,400
password and it up steps you into

521
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
biometrics but the problem is tomorrow

522
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
when you buy a new device you're right

523
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
back to typing your password again well

524
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,799
what if we can remove that restriction

525
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,280
what if we can give you a fido key the

526
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,679
moment that you register your biometric

527
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,080
for a certain app let's say i open my

528
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
bank of america take an example i open

529
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
my bank of america app on my phone i

530
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,960
open the bank of america websites on my

531
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
phone or my laptop i sign in with my

532
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,720
credentials username password and they

533
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,200
give me a fido key pair um i didn't go

534
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,480
into that details i'm assuming that

535
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
folks you kind of like have a basic

536
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
understanding of what's going on beneath

537
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,679
you know the the layers of fido but

538
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
essentially when you get a fido when you

539
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,200
do a fighter registration when you

540
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
register your security key or whether

541
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,720
you register your platform authenticator

542
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
your fingerprint sensor or your facial

543
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,360
recognition

544
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
on a certain website or to an app a

545
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
public private key key pair gets created

546
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,960
the private key stays on the device and

547
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799
the public key goes to the website right

548
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
so that's kind of like how fido works

549
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,360
back in the day earlier on fido private

550
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
keys were protected on the device only

551
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,320
when you have a physical security key

552
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,600
the private key is on the device it

553
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
stays there when you register it on your

554
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
phone or your laptop the fido private

555
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,799
key stays on the laptop what if that

556
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,520
restriction didn't exist what if we

557
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,039
could take that private key that you

558
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
have on your phone and we could

559
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,559
replicate it to all your other devices

560
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,160
that you own as well kind of almost like

561
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
what a password manager does today right

562
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
password manager wouldn't be super you

563
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,440
know useful if it only ever kept your

564
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,559
password on one device and you couldn't

565
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,320
get it off right password manager is

566
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
useful because your passwords are

567
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
available wherever you need to use it so

568
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,559
what if we take that property when we

569
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,960
apply it to phyto keys so when you

570
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
register a fido key and you make a new

571
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,799
photo key for a service on your phone

572
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,640
we're able to take that fido key and

573
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
replicate it and bring it to other

574
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
devices that you own as well now of

575
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
course if you're a studio you'll

576
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
immediately say well how do we know you

577
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
own those other devices what if it's an

578
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
attacker and that's the type of thing

579
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,280
that we want to get to later in our in

580
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
our panel session but essentially if

581
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,760
we're able to know that you own two or

582
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
three other devices let's just

583
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
proactively go and put your fido keys on

584
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
there as well what that means and what

585
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
that looks like is when you move and you

586
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
buy a new device you go buy a new phone

587
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
you never have to fall back to typing a

588
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,720
password ever again you'll just continue

589
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,559
to use your biometric your face your

590
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,080
fingerprint your screen unlocked and

591
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
that gets you access into that

592
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
particular

593
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
service without ever having to fall back

594
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
to passwords ever again it's basically

595
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
make fido as ubiquitous and available as

596
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,600
passwords there are some caveats to this

597
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
but we can get into that uh in in the in

598
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,760
the later session

599
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,480
the second thing is um well what happens

600
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
if you're on a device and you just don't

601
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
have your fido credentials there and

602
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,039
this is the typical password problem

603
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,400
right the password manager problem i

604
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
think i heard earlier folks saying like

605
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
you know i have this issue where i want

606
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,679
to sign in on my television or i want to

607
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,679
sign in on a friend's computer i have to

608
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
retype my passwords for my password

609
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
manager into the keyboard there are

610
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
special characters a huge pain in the

611
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
ass like how do we solve that problem

612
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
well the way that photo solves it is we

613
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
developed a local protocol that allows

614
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
two devices to talk to one another over

615
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
local proximity using a specialized

616
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
bluetooth protocol so essentially the

617
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
use cases i want to sign in on my

618
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
television i want to sign in on my

619
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
friend's laptop i go to their laptop i

620
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
click on the website they want to sign

621
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,400
into i bring my phone close enough

622
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
together which has my final pass keys

623
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,159
close enough together to their machine i

624
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,919
tap the account i want to use and

625
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,240
magically i'm signed in no retyping of

626
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
credentials totally fishing resistant

627
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,320
because everything that is fighter

628
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,159
related still stays intact and my

629
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,679
credential actually never goes to my

630
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,840
friend's machine only the signature that

631
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,919
allows a once used sign-in actually goes

632
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
to their machine over this local

633
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,440
proximity protocol because it's not via

634
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
the cloud because it's local proximity

635
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,880
based we get all of the inherent

636
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
phishing protection that you get out of

637
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,960
fido in this particular protocol as well

638
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,880
and these two things is basically the

639
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
only difference between what we had in

640
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
old fido and what we have a new pass

641
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,559
keys its fighter credentials with the

642
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
ability to synchronize and the ability

643
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,400
to be exercised remotely using these

644
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
proximity protocols that we've now

645
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,000
defined and that most

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
popular operating systems have stated

647
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,799
that they will adopt so we have support

648
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,039
for this uh whether you're using android

649
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,720
to a mac device or whether using an

650
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
iphone to a windows device these

651
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
protocols are implemented in a

652
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
standardized way so that it's not a

653
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,159
vendor lock-in it works basically

654
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,840
essential well it works doesn't matter

655
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,280
what what platform you own as long as

656
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
it's a fairly modern platform and again

657
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
we can talk about the exact versioning

658
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,039
there um these types of experiences is

659
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,400
what we enable

660
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
um so you know here's an experience on

661
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,840
windows for example user goes want to

662
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
sign in somewhere um sends a prompt to

663
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
the phone again it's not a prompt via

664
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,559
the cloud it's a prompt to the system on

665
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
android here it's also not to an app

666
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,480
it's to the android system and it allows

667
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,559
you to then unlock in this case using

668
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,960
your face here um pick the account you

669
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
want to use and then over the local

670
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
proximity protocol we then let the

671
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
device know that yep the user has

672
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,440
authorized this login they can go ahead

673
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
and they can continue uh you know down

674
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,360
this down this track um

675
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
cross device cross ecosystem you know

676
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
one mobile device can boost up another

677
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,159
ecosystem or another device which is

678
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,960
essentially um how we get away from the

679
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,080
issue of having the user you know retype

680
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,159
long strings and if you retype a long

681
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,000
string you can make it error and type it

682
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
into a phishing website and whatever

683
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,360
none of that is is is in effect here

684
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,480
because everything is essentially

685
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,159
automated between these two systems and

686
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,240
there's a handshake so access a new app

687
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,919
using mobile device to sign in and then

688
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
the thinking is if you use your mobile

689
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
device to sign in on a new system if

690
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,679
that's your system if that's not your

691
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
friend you can create a brand new pass

692
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,559
key on that system that signs you into

693
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,159
the account so tomorrow if you come back

694
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,760
on your windows machine you don't have

695
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
to grab your phone again because that

696
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
would be painful right you can now just

697
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,280
on your windows machine show your face

698
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,799
touch your fingerprint whatever you need

699
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,720
to do and then get you back into that

700
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
same service in an easier way so no need

701
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,679
to fall back um you know to using your

702
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,120
phone every single time that you want to

703
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
log on on devices that you own and

704
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
devices that you trust so with this

705
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
let's look at a quick demo if i can make

706
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,880
this work um this is always a little bit

707
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,799
tricky but i'm going to try my best

708
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,760
let's open this guy up here

709
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,279
and essentially what i want to do is i

710
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,400
want to show the

711
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
the experience that i just you know talk

712
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
you guys through i want to show that

713
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,320
experience in real time um on my android

714
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,000
device so let's see if we're able to

715
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
make this work

716
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
if everything works you should see my

717
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
phone screen there in a second cool okay

718
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
so that's always good if that part works

719
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
so that is just my android phone that i

720
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
have here right so i'm going to take you

721
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,720
through a typical experience of a user

722
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
here using pass keys

723
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,559
and essentially it goes like this user

724
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,039
goes opens their browser and they hit

725
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
you know their favorite

726
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
banking website in this case i have this

727
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
fictitious bank called tribank uh i've

728
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,880
never dealt with pass keys in my life

729
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,559
ever before this is my first time doing

730
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,559
that so what will happen is the system

731
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
says hey do you want to sign in ignore

732
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,080
the signing with a pass key button at

733
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
the top for the moment let's just talk

734
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,200
about the or space at the bottom right

735
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,520
so this is a user never dealt with fast

736
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,440
keys ever before first time ever they're

737
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,679
gonna go in they're gonna type oh sorry

738
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,600
let's refresh this make sure everything

739
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,000
works yep user goes types username

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
types password and hit the sign in

741
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
button right

742
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,799
now what will happen in the background

743
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,840
is the

744
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,240
system will detect the tribank

745
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,760
server side system will detect on a

746
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,440
device that supports baskets that's a

747
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,600
silent detection mechanism we've added

748
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,039
and it'll offer the user the option to

749
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,480
create what's called the passkey so

750
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,000
there's an explicit passkey creation

751
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
moment that takes place i'm going to say

752
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,679
yep create me a passkey

753
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,520
system ui kicks in and says hey do you

754
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
want to pass me i say yeah sure i want

755
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
one here's a little bit of metadata

756
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,039
about the pass key pass keys contains an

757
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,120
icon it contains a you know a display

758
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,640
name it contains a username a bunch of

759
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
information and it also tells me they're

760
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
down at the bottom that this pass key

761
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
will be synchronized to my google

762
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
account in the future so if i sign into

763
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,880
android on any other device i will

764
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
actually be getting those pass keys on

765
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
that device as well and then lastly i

766
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,159
need to do a user gesture here touch my

767
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,320
fingerprint and that creates my opacity

768
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,760
so now that i have a pass key on my

769
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
phone next time i come back to tribank

770
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
either on this phone or on any other

771
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,520
phone that's signed into that same

772
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,760
google account all i have to do is

773
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
either now know that i have to hit the

774
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,640
sign in with a pass key button but we

775
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
know most users won't so we've decided

776
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,559
to also integrate pass keys with the

777
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
autofull system on the particular device

778
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,559
that we're on so if the user were to

779
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,000
click into the account name field here

780
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
which is what i'm going to do

781
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
rather than allowing me to type it'll

782
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
come up and say hey you've got a pass

783
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,679
key do you want to use that and i'm

784
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,799
going to go yeah sure i'm going to use

785
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,120
my pass key click it touch my

786
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,159
fingerprint

787
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,520
and at this point i should

788
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
instantaneously be signed into the

789
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
account now i mean up until this point

790
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,640
that still makes a lot of sense um one

791
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
other cool thing that i didn't say is

792
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
once i made a pass key on the web the

793
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
same pass key is also usable in an app

794
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,840
so if i download the tribank app from

795
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
the google play store i can now open the

796
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,640
tribank app

797
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,960
i can hit sign in with a pass key here

798
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
i can click on that exact same passcode

799
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
i created over on the web and because

800
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,279
the app and the website is linked using

801
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,360
asset linking i can go and just touch my

802
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
fingerprint and amazingly be signed into

803
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
my app as well so whether i create the

804
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,159
pass key on the web or the app doesn't

805
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,679
really matter they're usable in both

806
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,559
places and then as a last um

807
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,000
kind of little

808
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
add-on to the demo is let's quickly show

809
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
how the experience would work for a user

810
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,200
that's on a friend's machine um so i'm

811
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
going to sign into tribank on my buddy's

812
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
machine over here and what i'm going to

813
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
do is i'm going to go to the tri bank

814
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
website to make sure it's online there

815
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
we go and i'm not going to type in my

816
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
username and password here i'm simply

817
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,399
going to say sign in with a passkey

818
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,679
the system will detect that i don't have

819
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,120
any pass keys yet for triband so it's

820
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,559
going to tell me to scan this qr code

821
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,399
now the qr code is necessary just to let

822
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,000
these two devices know that they want to

823
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
be talking to one another if you have

824
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
another five laptops and two phones in

825
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
the audience here we don't want my phone

826
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
to accidentally talk to your laptop so

827
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,320
it's kind of like a disambiguation thing

828
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,080
where i want to make sure this laptop

829
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
and this phone talk to one another over

830
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
bluetooth i'm going to say use pass key

831
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
there is no explicit pairing everything

832
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,679
is handled by the protocol so i say yep

833
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,039
i allow these devices to talk to one

834
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,000
another

835
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,919
the pass key i created earlier in my

836
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,240
demo is now available on my phone i pick

837
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,120
it

838
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,799
touch my fingerprint

839
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,559
and at that point in time i should be

840
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,880
magically signed in on my laptop here on

841
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,120
the left and as i said earlier because i

842
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
don't have a pass key on my laptop yet

843
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
the website will offer me to create a

844
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,240
local one so next time i come back to

845
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,840
tri-bank i don't have to grab my phone

846
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,279
so i'm going to say yeah sure make me

847
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,679
another pass key on my laptop

848
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,039
i can use my fingerprint because this

849
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,120
laptop is one of those that's equipped

850
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
with a fingerprint sensor so i'm going

851
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,399
to touch my fingerprint and now i have

852
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
yet another pass key for this website on

853
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,919
my laptop so if i ever come back to this

854
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,640
website on my laptop here i can just

855
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
click sign in with a pass key

856
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
touch my fingerprint no phone needed

857
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,360
pick the credential that i want to use

858
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,279
and instantly i will be signed into the

859
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,799
account

860
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,960
um i promise i'm almost done we'll go

861
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,120
quick recap and then i will make time

862
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,159
for the

863
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
for the panel here let's just look at a

864
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,559
quick recap here so what did we see here

865
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,640
well the first one is

866
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
user info is stored on the authenticator

867
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,240
on the registration right remember i had

868
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
this promo where the website said hey do

869
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,120
you want a pass key at that point in

870
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
time i create the credential on the

871
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
device it's called the discoverable

872
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
credential which means metadata about

873
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,679
the credential is associated with it on

874
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,440
the device which means i don't need to

875
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
type usernames anymore i don't need to

876
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
type passwords all of that information

877
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,039
is now associated and stored on the on

878
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,559
the particular authenticator on the

879
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,480
platform so next time i open that

880
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
website up the system can prompt me for

881
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,399
all of my stored credentials

882
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,080
i simply pick the one i want to use

883
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,159
click on the one do my fingerprint scan

884
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,640
and amazingly i'm signed it

885
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,279
as i said the synchronization happens if

886
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,600
i own more than one device and they're

887
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,360
all signed into the same

888
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
into the same account we get

889
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
synchronization now here's a little

890
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
caveat synchronization doesn't happen

891
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,120
like in password managers between chrome

892
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
on windows to chrome on android to

893
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,279
chrome on mac no no for fido we want

894
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,320
platform support so pass keys only sync

895
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,960
in between ecosystems owned by the same

896
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,440
vendor so on android my pass keys made

897
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
on android only sync to other android

898
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
devices it doesn't sync anywhere else

899
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,679
passkey is made on mac os sync to ipad

900
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
os and they sync to ios all part of the

901
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,520
apple ecosystem

902
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,440
passkeys from

903
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
android does not sync to ios if i want

904
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
to sign in on my mac device using an

905
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
android phone i need to use the cross

906
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,799
device bluetooth flow that we saw the qr

907
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,200
code scan flow that's how i get my pass

908
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,679
keys or the sign-in mechanism between

909
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,760
devices of different ecosystems and the

910
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,679
reason why we went for that is we wanted

911
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,440
the security properties of hardware

912
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
bound and stored keys that's stored

913
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,679
directly inside of the system we did not

914
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,279
want to have the

915
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
the same issues where the

916
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,880
private keys is perhaps just stored in a

917
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
file on disk so malware can get to it we

918
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,320
wanted the assurance of having these

919
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
keys protected by the hardware which

920
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,320
means passkey keys also inherently get

921
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,559
away from other forms of multi-factor if

922
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,960
i have a pass key i don't need sms otp i

923
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
don't need google authenticator i don't

924
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,799
need push authentication pass keys solve

925
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,120
two authentication factors in one single

926
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
step the possession of the key and the

927
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
way to unlock it is enough to get access

928
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,279
to a pass key which should then account

929
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,279
for both authentication factors in one

930
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,960
fell swoop that's the other reason we

931
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,720
wanted to go down the the pass key route

932
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,880
here with the protection uh last slide i

933
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
promise is and then of course the

934
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,159
integration with autofor we don't think

935
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,760
it's going to be successful if we have

936
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
to train users to go and find a button

937
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
like this on a page so we actually don't

938
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,960
think that a button like this should

939
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
even be on a page for the next five

940
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,720
years we should have integration fast

941
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,559
keys directly in the autofill system so

942
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,399
that together with your passwords we

943
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
just show you available pass keys you

944
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,240
click on it and you can sign in and if

945
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
you don't have a pass key available you

946
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,039
can always go passkey from a different

947
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,720
device which allows you to pair a

948
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,559
different phone bring it to this in

949
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
proximity and then use the passkey from

950
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
another device to sign in on the device

951
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,840
that you currently own and that you're

952
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
currently on

953
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,600
um that is it i know i am one minute

954
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
over um any

955
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,120
questions i guess we can get into lots

956
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,279
of questions afterwards

957
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,200
thank you christian all right

958
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,840
i i do know i have tons of questions but

959
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,080
that's why we are doing the pal uh now

960
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,399
so andrew and tim

961
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,600
can also come up and join me on stage

962
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,480
um

963
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,919
and um

964
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,600
well short round of applause for

965
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,830
christian first of course

966
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,909
[Applause]
