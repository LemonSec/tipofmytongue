1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,199
so we have with us matthew woodyard uh

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,440
from oath zero uh

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,359
first time of our pastor's comp but he's

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,120
been to besides before

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,000
um not trying to intimidate or scare you

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
or anything i'm really happy to have you

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
here and with this talk protecting

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,160
against breach credentials in identity

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
workflows so

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
go ahead

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
all right thank you so much for the

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
introduction since it's my first time

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,279
here i'd like to tell you a little bit

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,800
about myself so

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,439
professionally i was in finance for

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,640
about a decade um and worked through a

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,719
lot of rotations within security so it

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,760
could have been compliance um fraud

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,800
uh

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,399
architecture really anything you can

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
imagine um i probably did it at least

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
for a little bit of rotation i

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
co-founded a threat intelligence startup

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
called bad packets

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,800
and currently i research emerging

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
threats at auth0 based a lot on the data

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,399
that we have

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,480
i also do some academic research with

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
the university of glasgow mostly on

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,920
botnet tracking

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
um i live in chicago i love to bike i've

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,040
started gardening but i'm really bad at

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
it

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
mostly it's just weeding i mean honestly

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,080
like if your partner wants a garden you

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,240
will weed the garden so

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
that's how it goes um so about us uh

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
auth0 part of octa

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
we're a customer identity access

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
management platform which means that we

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
focus mostly on things um facing

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
customers so you like sneakers you go to

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
site to sell sneakers you hit that log

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,920
on box that's what we do and anything

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,159
past that though completely opaque to us

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,000
right so we don't know anything about

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
the web apps downstream we don't know

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
about their appsec posture um so that

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
gives our intel team the motivation to

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,399
track botnets track credential leaks

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
aggregate insights from the logs that we

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
get from all of our customers and

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
maintain a robust credential database

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
and integrate it into um identity

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
workflows before they hit applications

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
because that's where our control stops

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
all right so that's me um i want to talk

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
just a little bit about credential

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
stuffing you know

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
what it is um

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
keep things a little bit informal really

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,440
because i know that a lot of people in

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
this um room may have some background

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
here

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
on what it is already but nevertheless

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
we'll go through it i'll keep things a

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
little bit informal i'll stop for

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
questions like in 3x so

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
if there are any

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
things that need clarified please

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
definitely do that

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
so we'll start with the

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
what why and how of credential stuffing

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,000
the state of affairs and what we're

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
seeing from our log data and controls

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,518
that we can put in place

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,640
so what credential stuffing is exactly

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
um essentially it's the reuse of

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
credential leaks and attacks from

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,319
unrelated

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,959
leaks to the target account so by

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
credentials here for the scope of this

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
talk i just mean things like usernames

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
email addresses and passwords used in

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
some combination um or or something like

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
this so related attacks like session

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
hijacking other types of brute force

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,440
attacks gonna be out of scope for the

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,640
purposes of this um presentation but i

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
think president um credential stuff you

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
will be with us always because people

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
will continue to reuse passwords sites

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
will continue to leak the passwords that

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
you used on them

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
um

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,640
so why do threat actors employ this

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,799
attack in the first place besides just

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
his efficacy like what are they after

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
what are the goals

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,440
so a lot of times there's an economic

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,680
objective so i'm going to give as an

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
example say that an attacker wants to do

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
an account takeover and their goal is to

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
use a password that you had used before

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,319
say that it was leaked by ashley madison

106
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
and you re reuse that password on your

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,760
favorite sneaker ecommerce site that

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,159
person wants to

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
get those sneakers resell those sneakers

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,879
and there you go so

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
a second example of why you would

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
fall victim to credential stuffing is

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
attackers themselves want the personal

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,519
data so there's sort of this feedback

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,918
loop to the attack itself where if you

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
have access to the account you get to

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
learn more about the subject you get

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
access to their sneaker account you find

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,800
out where they live you can then launch

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
a more targeted

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,199
attack and similarly from a workforce

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
standpoint homestead among us has not

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,919
reused their work email on another

124
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
service maybe you don't reuse your

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,360
password as passwords con we don't reuse

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
passwords here but you probably reuse

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,199
your email and it's really great for

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
lateral movement um if somebody's domain

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
is octa.com that gets leaked i wonder

130
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
where they work

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
all right so let's put it all together

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
i'm probably going to walk for this one

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
hope that it works

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
okay cool

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,199
all right so an attacker would start

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,440
with a

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,080
list of passwords from the usual sources

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
so you know um

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,680
dark web uh whatever um public leaks and

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
their own previous attacks so this is

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
kind of the feedback loop that i'm

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
talking about here um they would load

143
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
that into a database and either through

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,199
scripted or unscripted means like humans

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,639
and we'll talk more about that in a

146
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,840
little bit

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
typically through a botnet or something

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
to obfuscate them they'll hit your

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,360
identity workflow and then they'll get

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
to your precious web application so

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
separating out the identity workflow for

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,520
the purposes of this talk is going to be

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
at least a little bit important because

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
that's the data that we're looking at

155
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
right so i'm going to take the first

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,639
break for discussion if there's anything

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
about that that wasn't clear that you

158
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
have questions about maybe it went too

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,440
fast

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
let's go ahead and take a second to talk

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
about that and if any of you want to

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
volunteer kind of

163
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
what against your organization attackers

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
are after this is a great time to do

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
that

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
so

167
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
um is there a mic runner was there a

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
question

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
my money all right your attackers are

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,559
after money really glad to hear that

171
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
but is it is it primarily a monetary

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
objective in this room like uh is most

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,039
of it they're trying to steal some

174
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
material good or you know take money

175
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,080
directly or what

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
okay yeah

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
so what you're saying is that a lot of

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
the attackers that you see they're kind

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
of getting in dorking around figuring

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,400
out what's there in the first place and

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,440
they're not coming into it with like it

182
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
right yeah so they're not coming into

183
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
the attack thinking oh man i'm gonna get

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
some sneakers out of this deal right

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
they're just that's what you see a lot

186
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
of

187
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
okay great yeah so that gives me an idea

188
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
a little bit on what to focus on as well

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,400
um

190
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,319
so thanks for your input on that gonna

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,720
talk a little bit um about

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
how bad things are and um

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
how everything you see presented was

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,720
generated so with only a few exceptions

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,199
um all this data is aggregated and

196
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
generated by the authentication

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
logs that we get

198
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
as auth0 and the insight that we've

199
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,120
gained as

200
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,639
practitioners in the threat intel team

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,919
so

202
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,080
will you be targeted uh science point to

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
yes so we did a look at quarter one of

204
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
this year and saw how many of when i say

205
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
applications um i mean tenants and we

206
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
can break down to what that looks like

207
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,960
um in the q a if you like but 48 saw

208
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,199
seven or more attempts

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
of credential stuffing against their

210
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
applications

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
so what will that attack look like to

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
get a feel i'm gonna give an example

213
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
here of a real world credential stuffing

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
attack so the graph shows a number of

215
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
authentication attempts before that's in

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
blue during that's uh one where you see

217
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
the big red bars and then after where

218
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
we've got blue bars again um of an

219
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
attack against one of off zero's

220
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,759
customers

221
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
so during this time frame the malicious

222
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
attack ended up being around

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,400
two times the number of

224
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
median login attempts from the previous

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
i think six months

226
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,199
um so i mean really

227
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
depending upon what your identity

228
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,880
paradigm looks like it almost looks like

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
an l7 attack against your authentication

230
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,479
right so

231
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
extremely common attacks um that's

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,599
generally what we see um how they work

233
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
so what's the mechanics of how we get

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,360
there i'm going to go through a

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,839
timeline of a

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
story based on a real world

237
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,519
attack that we saw and a little bit of

238
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
insight from verizon's data breach

239
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,160
investigations report the dvir

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
so

241
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
the dpr dvir um showed that

242
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,720
over 60

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
of breaches were actually detected by

244
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
victims within

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
24 to

246
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
84 hours

247
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,880
the bad news of that is that they

248
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
normally didn't detect it themselves

249
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,279
they were disclosed by the attacker by a

250
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
law enforcement agency an external cert

251
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
team

252
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,279
whatever right so in this attack that we

253
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,000
saw first the attacker obviously stole

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
the credentials we can't clearly know

255
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,360
this time

256
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,240
but

257
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,360
the

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
agency that we had worked with um had

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,519
estimated that it probably was about 24

260
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,920
hours between the breach the

261
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
confirmation of the breach and the first

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
attack

263
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,720
and in the next 24 hours the leaked

264
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
credentials were

265
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
um

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
identified by the detection response

267
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
team of our customers verified by us as

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,200
well and we were able to

269
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,240
put the credentials in our credential

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,640
stuffing protection workflows and within

271
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,399
really just minutes of putting it in

272
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,959
there we already saw use of the breach

273
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,440
credentials only from that one threat

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
group though we think you can never be

275
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
sure about these things

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
um over the next 72 hours we did um

277
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
ongoing monitoring and

278
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
really again saw it mostly coming from

279
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
just one group but once we got to i put

280
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,120
84 hours but it really is 84 plus

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
because it took about a month for us to

282
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
see this in the wild just very broadly

283
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
used so that really i think gives you an

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
idea from the amount of time you would

285
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,640
see going from breach to opportunistic

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
so um

287
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
this leads into specif um sophistication

288
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
and i kind of want to just really show

289
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,839
how low the bar is there's a lot going

290
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,519
on this chart i'm gonna walk over there

291
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,240
and talk through it

292
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
so what we see a lot of is like does the

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
attacker even try

294
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
so these dots down here is just normal

295
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,560
um authentication traffic right this up

296
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
here the size of the dot is um number of

297
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
ips um in requests and what we're

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
looking at is the number of unique user

299
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
agents versus

300
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
um

301
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,640
the number of attempts right so this

302
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
attacker up here is using a botnet it's

303
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
not a great botnet they're not even

304
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
messing with the http headers right this

305
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
is part of what gives us an idea of

306
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
whether or not sophisticated group is

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,680
using breach credentials and here we

308
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
have one that is at least a little bit

309
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,839
more sophisticated because they're

310
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
trying to use user agents that look like

311
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,200
humans

312
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
right so really this is how low the bar

313
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,000
is when it comes to attackers and their

314
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,800
sophistication

315
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
so i kind of break this into two

316
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
personas here um i think about the

317
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
opportunistic attacker

318
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,880
we'll call him sam skitty and they are

319
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
always using the older leaks a lot of

320
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,760
times public leaks um very common leaks

321
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,399
so if you just do a count of all the

322
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
times you've seen a email address for

323
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
example and just do a sort

324
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,440
that's what they're going to be using

325
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
oftentimes they don't even try

326
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,839
to rate limit

327
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,560
circumvent very common controls

328
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
and then ada ato we'll call them

329
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
works on fresh leaks like what i showed

330
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,399
before

331
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
they use bespoke botnets we'll talk a

332
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
little bit about what that

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
sophistication looks like and they

334
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
emulate human activity either by being

335
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
humans or um scripting and other

336
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
a little bit more clever

337
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
methods so

338
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
take a break here to pause

339
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
have you seen credential stuffing

340
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
attacks in your org what do they look

341
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,079
like do they look like what i just

342
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
presented do they look totally different

343
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
obviously i'm giving a very simple

344
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
picture here because i'd really like

345
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
feedback on this topic

346
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
yeah and if the mic doesn't work i'll

347
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
just repeat the question hopefully that

348
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,359
worked out well

349
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
got one in the back i've seen it tons of

350
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
times but i'm not partial you know i'm

351
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
not neutral in this one

352
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
hi yes

353
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
we've seen my employer has seen creation

354
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
stopping attacks

355
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,519
and actually with a

356
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,440
shorter timeline they are showing here

357
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
and on the more advanced side of it so

358
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,880
yeah

359
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
it's real

360
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,320
so it's real and kind of what i

361
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
presented matches up with your

362
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,079
experience more or less

363
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,720
okay um yeah i'm honestly happy to hear

364
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
that because as a researcher you're

365
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
never really sure if you're on the right

366
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
track until everybody else tells you you

367
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
are or i don't know if you have low

368
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
self-esteem it kind of works the same

369
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
way

370
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
so if there are no other questions i can

371
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
just move on to talking about controls

372
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,480
that might be put in place we are way

373
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
ahead of time so

374
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
this should go pretty well um i want to

375
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,680
revisit what i presented for before

376
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
on

377
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,199
what a slightly more sophisticated look

378
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,360
from the identity side might look like

379
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
so you still got the attackers

380
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,440
aggregating leaks they're still using a

381
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,480
botnet

382
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
but in the identity workflow we've got

383
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
the breach credentials detection and

384
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,639
that's really what makes a difference

385
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,279
right it is so important to have at

386
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,360
least some kind of list there to some

387
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,959
kind of tracking of the logs and

388
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,320
analytics and have some kind of action

389
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,120
taken after that so what we have are

390
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,000
things like notifying users forcing a

391
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
password reset

392
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,399
sorry forcing a password reset

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
some people do things like mandatory

394
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
education right where it's like hey i

395
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,519
see this has been reused this is where

396
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,760
it's been reused

397
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,639
you may

398
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
you may want to look into such and such

399
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
a thing or try such and such a thing

400
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,480
right

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
so

402
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
i think really the

403
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,240
solution here is defense in depth though

404
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,199
because

405
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
just having the protection that i showed

406
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
before is

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,560
really not going to be enough so bot

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
detection

409
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
i think plays a huge role here so when i

410
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
was speaking of more sophisticated

411
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,680
attackers if somebody knows the

412
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
area in which their target lives so back

413
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
to the person attempting to purchase

414
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,680
sneakers

415
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
they would want to err on the side of

416
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
using a residential

417
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,160
botnet that is actually a residential ip

418
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
in the area of where the target lives

419
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
this is a way of circumventing fraud

420
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,560
controls downstream

421
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,480
and it's a great way of circumventing

422
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
bot detection controls because often

423
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
these botnets are ephemeral fairly

424
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,279
short-lived take advantage of iot

425
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,600
devices or routers and and they just

426
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,320
look really really real so i think this

427
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
is an important control to have in-house

428
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
to protect your identity workflow

429
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,360
if you don't have it in-house then you

430
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
might want to buy it just figure out

431
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
what your budget looks like for that

432
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
second is going to be rate limiting i

433
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
i'm always shocked when i see how few

434
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,680
attackers even try to circumvent this

435
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
control

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,279
i i really am and the linkage the

437
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
credential stuffing we always see is is

438
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
very strong very strong a lot of

439
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,320
credential stuffing attacks are people

440
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
trying very hard very fast but we also

441
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
see things like people sprinkling in

442
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,959
attempts not trying too much again

443
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,360
that's the more sophisticated attacker

444
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,959
and rate limiting isn't going to work on

445
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,839
that

446
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,680
neither is something like impossible

447
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
travel where you might look at the ip of

448
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
somebody who signed in and see like oh

449
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
wow you're signed in from

450
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
norway and las vegas like that's pretty

451
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
weird we're going to throw up a flag

452
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,720
there if you have a more sophisticated

453
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,880
attacker not going to work if you have a

454
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,799
site where your users care about their

455
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,199
privacy generally also not going to work

456
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
because they're going to use vpns

457
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,559
probably in short amounts of sessions

458
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,439
right so i so dislike impossible travel

459
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
that i did not even put it on the slide

460
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
but nevertheless it is worth discussing

461
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,839
if you're talking about botnets and rate

462
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,679
limiting

463
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,280
and if you have the capability the next

464
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,160
move would be to rule and risk-based

465
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
pre-login assessment or assessment

466
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,080
throughout the process

467
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,720
so when you're looking at that attacker

468
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
if you're able to do constant

469
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,120
authentication using mouse usage

470
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
maybe analytics about how they use their

471
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
keyboards etc that's something that is

472
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
an extremely effective control that

473
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
frankly your id provider probably can't

474
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,440
give you if it is an external provider

475
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
right they're not going to see that

476
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,880
downstream that's going to be an

477
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
application security concern

478
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
and finally there's a reason i put it to

479
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
bottom is multi-factor authentication

480
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,039
there is a trade-off in this control

481
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,480
that

482
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,160
really depends on the market power that

483
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
your company has to be honest with you i

484
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,679
use some intuit products um

485
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,160
not going to call many of them out but

486
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
every time i log in i need an sms second

487
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
factor which is a terrible second factor

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
that i never asked for that makes using

489
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,320
hey how you hydrated hey you know what i

490
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,120
could be more hydrated

491
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
maybe i should have gone with the

492
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,280
stand-up routine or improv in chicago

493
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,440
i can't juggle

494
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,240
i cannot juggle that

495
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,360
i go i go fast i do

496
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,960
i get through you know what i probably

497
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,600
can't i drink like a diabetic camel

498
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,120
you requested you get it

499
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
i didn't even put that on the request

500
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,520
that's your mind reader um

501
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
a flamingo dance would have been better

502
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
but i'll take the water

503
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,559
yes thank you thank you for the water

504
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,200
appreciate it

505
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
so multi-factor authentication honestly

506
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
said don't like it a whole lot really

507
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
don't

508
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
but if you're into it and you have

509
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
markets really cornered okay yeah what's

510
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,120
up but like you know you've got things

511
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
like the email email section factor

512
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,880
there's an option as well which is a

513
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
little bit lower barrier

514
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,799
but you know for obviously like uh

515
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,559
sticking your own organization your

516
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,760
staff members

517
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,799
like surely it's impossible yeah well

518
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
that's a okay let me repeat the question

519
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,640
if that's okay

520
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
so the question in essence is

521
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
why don't i like multifactor that much

522
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
and i'm going to put it more generously

523
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,400
towards me um because i realized that

524
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,919
saying you don't like multi-factor a

525
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,400
whole lot can be a real bad look at a

526
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,799
security conference

527
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
but i also look bad so you know i guess

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
they go well together um

529
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,559
so i think it comes down to market power

530
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,880
um and where you are so with workforce

531
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,960
mfa always do it um if it's not email or

532
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,520
sms and something stronger that's great

533
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
i really think you should do it right

534
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,919
and so like the octa part of my brain

535
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,679
does not agree with the statement i just

536
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,000
made but with workforce you have to ask

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,039
the question

538
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,280
where are my workers gonna go i'm not

539
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
gonna lose workers over this right but

540
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
if you're selling sneakers and somebody

541
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
closes that tab

542
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
that is that's why you have workers in

543
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
the first place

544
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
so that's i mean i really think that is

545
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
a core trade-off um i don't know does

546
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,840
that make sense and more importantly is

547
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,159
that like totally incorrect in your view

548
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
because i'm open to vote

549
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
i think we're trying to protect against

550
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,600
different types of things here

551
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,559
my security problem

552
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
your security problems are very

553
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
interesting in my research

554
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
yeah we can um we also have like enough

555
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,320
time to keep things online too um that's

556
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,200
like exactly we're actually i think

557
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
maybe one slide away from the last so

558
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
that is

559
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
why i'm here in the first place um i

560
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
really do want it to be discussion i

561
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,039
think part of being a researcher is

562
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,720
carrying on the conversation right the

563
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,159
great conversation

564
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,159
that's pretty much what we do like it or

565
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
not in service of capital so you know

566
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
basically though i think that's what it

567
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,799
comes down to is a risk-based decision

568
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,600
and

569
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
me as a user what i don't like about sms

570
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
and email mfa being forced on me at

571
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
every login is you've introduced

572
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
friction with frankly not a huge value

573
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,280
add in security and if intuit had any

574
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
competition they probably wouldn't do it

575
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,520
right they would probably lean more on

576
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,120
risk-based controls or give me the

577
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,440
option of what i want to use like when

578
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,159
it comes to mfa uh they put water so i

579
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
can't put my laptop up um it's really

580
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,760
cool to have something where you can

581
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,039
push a button

582
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,080
and if you've got workforce and you have

583
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
a postal service at your disposal you

584
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,919
can mail them hardware security devices

585
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,840
you can have them enroll that device

586
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
right so i really think the friction is

587
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
really important um we talked about

588
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,159
market power yeah you gotta ask what's

589
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,080
there to lose what are they after in an

590
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
enterprise you may have like a whole lot

591
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
to lose i've worked for really really

592
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
large organizations and if you're like

593
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,919
one of the biggest banks on the planet

594
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
like what is there at stake like don't

595
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,080
want to be too dramatic but the world

596
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,360
economy i think we've seen

597
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,039
and what's the cost of implementing the

598
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
control finally i think is really

599
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
important like it comes down to

600
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
organization size so

601
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
show of hands how many work at an

602
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,960
organization smaller than 100

603
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,440
workers

604
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,080
okay awesome uh you just volunteered

605
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,919
yourself to be

606
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,400
to have a question asked so from your

607
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
standpoint of all the controls we've

608
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,919
mentioned and maybe others that you

609
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
could think of

610
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,880
which do you have the budget to

611
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
implement and how difficult is it

612
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,159
if you worked at a company 100

613
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,480
individuals or fewer

614
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
what you know kind of what would you run

615
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,919
up against right like we've talked about

616
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,960
what what the highest roi probably is

617
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,200
right so what what aligns with your

618
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,520
budget

619
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,120
uh yeah

620
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,039
you're gonna need some friends you have

621
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,039
100 friends at best

622
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,360
yes

623
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,559
[Music]

624
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,559
could you give him a mic i'm sorry i

625
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,440
yeah

626
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
when i hear mssp i'm like all right

627
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,240
let's get on the record here so uh all

628
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
right it's working i run an mssp and we

629
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
run up to accounts not quite under 100

630
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
but 500 or less and a lot of them have

631
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
that question of you know what do we

632
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,279
implement what's the best roi um and

633
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,480
despite

634
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
our best efforts not all of them want to

635
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
do you know risk-based discussions and

636
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
go through that and really pinpoint so

637
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,039
we had to come up with like our

638
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,440
essentials package which

639
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
mfa is on there because in a lot of

640
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,120
cases it's free

641
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,960
with the tools that they're using um if

642
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
not it's cheap through octa or duo or

643
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,080
whoever

644
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
security awareness training

645
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
endpoint endpoint protection email

646
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,039
security

647
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,320
and then if they want to go one step

648
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,919
further vulnerability assessments and

649
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,039
all that but

650
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,039
um that's that's generally those those

651
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,400
are the first five controls that people

652
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,840
will reach for

653
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
and usually if there's like

654
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,480
you know no more than um 500 employees

655
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,159
that's usually within their budgetatory

656
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,919
grasp i mean at least for your customers

657
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,080
right yeah you can see i'm a little you

658
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
know kind of narrow-minded because of my

659
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
my topic or my specialty mostly being

660
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,200
siam but yeah i think i think that's

661
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
great insight for workforce and it's

662
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,039
good to know what they can afford and i

663
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,799
honestly do agree if you're a smaller

664
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,880
org and you're using a lot of

665
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,279
cloud-based services it really does

666
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
often make sense to just outsource that

667
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,799
one way or the other right

668
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,320
maybe there's this agreement there too

669
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
but but honestly that's my view is that

670
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,919
if you're not an identity company you

671
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
may not be that great identity so that's

672
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,200
just what i've seen

673
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,200
um yeah so i mean really that's it um if

674
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
you want to talk about whatever

675
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
protections you have in your workflows

676
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
what you think works and what doesn't um

677
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,039
if you want to get really in-depth

678
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,480
because i know there's a lot of password

679
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
con people that are like super duper

680
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,919
smart about passwords and cracking them

681
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,159
i would really love to hear your views

682
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,840
on um

683
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
did i leave it on i didn't leave it on

684
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,559
on this thing

685
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,679
right here

686
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,919
so managing what's in that database

687
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,120
securely

688
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,039
actually doing a good job in your

689
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,559
identity workflow of taking the

690
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,640
credentials that are entered comparing

691
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
it to what's in the breach credential

692
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,320
database insight on that um

693
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
of course would be extremely welcome and

694
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,360
um does anybody like have any thoughts

695
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,720
on that or

696
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,799
what they what they do in their own

697
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,360
experience

698
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,919
i can see you smiling under the mask

699
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,919
yeah

700
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,760
out of curiosity

701
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
do you make a difference between

702
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
credential stuffing and password

703
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,679
spraying

704
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,680
in this talk no

705
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,039
[Laughter]

706
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
um but do we track that yes right um of

707
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,279
course and it's i don't know all the

708
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,080
brute force sort of attacks have some

709
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,760
kind of

710
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,799
commonality um but password spraying is

711
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,559
almost closer to

712
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,919
opportunistic botnet activity i think um

713
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,480
it's it's not very good it's not usually

714
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
super targeted um but with credential

715
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,559
stuffing like at least you know

716
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,000
something

717
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
your attacker has a starting point um

718
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,039
but definitely tracking that obviously

719
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,320
extremely vital in any application

720
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,240
i think at least is

721
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
is looking for bridge credentials is

722
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
that part of your service and is it

723
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
integrated or is it an option that i can

724
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
purchase

725
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
additionally you can give us as much

726
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,679
money as you like um i i don't want to

727
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
plug services too hard because um i

728
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,490
don't i want to be asked back

729
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,799
[Music]

730
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,279
yeah well i'm not asking for a quote

731
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,640
most definitely not

732
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,840
i do have an opinion on the use of uh

733
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,320
services providing bridge credentials uh

734
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
information from be it dark web or

735
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,240
wherever you find it so yeah okay yes so

736
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,039
i i will say yes to that um i i think i

737
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,200
can safely say that you know as you saw

738
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,880
from the example we work really closely

739
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
with our customers and they want that

740
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,200
stuff in our breach password protection

741
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,679
database too so we get a lot of good

742
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,720
stuff from that um you know we buy data

743
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,760
from lots of cti vendors as you might

744
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
imagine when it comes to credentials um

745
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,799
honestly we're not running crackers but

746
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,840
i would love to hear the roi on that uh

747
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,120
because i know there have been lots of

748
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
great talks on cracking passwords here

749
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,799
but i didn't i don't know if there's

750
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,960
been a lot of talk of like okay here's

751
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,880
the buy versus build like here's how

752
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
much really you want to spend on having

753
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,440
a gpu or whatever that could actually

754
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
crack you know

755
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,200
certain passwords hashed a certain way

756
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
or whatever um that's a discussion super

757
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
happy to have and this is definitely the

758
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,880
venue for it

759
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,279
um but yeah i i know that

760
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,200
more than like talked about your

761
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,159
question

762
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,200
but but i i hope that helps at least and

763
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,440
um honestly if if you're not gonna buy

764
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,799
it um you really should consider

765
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,760
building it like honestly

766
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
yeah so maybe i should go back to our

767
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,960
controls worth it because like is x

768
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,799
worth it is always something of great

769
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,880
interest to me and not just because i'm

770
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,200
at like a third-party vendor now um part

771
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
of like if you have principal or staff

772
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
or director in your title is like being

773
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,080
able to bs enough that you can like put

774
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,799
that question into your budget ask so

775
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,720
yeah

776
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,799
i just wanted to ask a question so if

777
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
you have a bridge

778
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
credential detection

779
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,640
why don't you notify people proactively

780
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,279
and using the database to actually you

781
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
know uh

782
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
reset those credentials ahead of the

783
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
time before the attack is happening i

784
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
mean i understand that you can

785
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,080
use that database maybe to detect the

786
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,399
attack itself and identify the malicious

787
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,039
ip but as far as the users are concerned

788
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,559
wouldn't it be better to notify them

789
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,399
ahead of the time

790
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
hmm that's that's a good question

791
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
honestly so for example if we had an

792
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
email address we know it was associated

793
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,200
with a a credential that had been

794
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,880
breached wouldn't it make sense to

795
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,279
notify that person rather than waiting

796
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,880
for them to log on to a downstream

797
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
service that's really the heart of it

798
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,679
right

799
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
um i think like

800
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
honestly part of it is is to have it in

801
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,679
product um to be super frank but also

802
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,159
when people actually try it that's what

803
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,000
gives us confirmation that we're on to

804
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,919
something because if you're using that

805
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,159
email and password in multiple contacts

806
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,840
we don't know if that password's still

807
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
like relevant you know maybe the leak

808
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,720
was from 2019 like a linkedin leak or

809
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,360
something like this so that's kind of i

810
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
hope i hope this answers satisfactory to

811
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,360
you but those are really i think the two

812
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,880
biggest reasons that we don't

813
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,120
proactively notify people who may have

814
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,279
been involved in breaches um honestly

815
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,399
said i also think that's a

816
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,360
responsibility of the company that was

817
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,039
supposed to be securing your credentials

818
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,679
in the first place

819
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,279
no one to scare them off um

820
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,880
yeah i suppose that's true

821
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,120
hey i just uh was curious bit about your

822
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,120
risk-based decision making in siam um so

823
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,559
what kind of practical implementations

824
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,320
could somebody look at if they wanted to

825
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
do risk-based

826
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,559
policy for

827
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,960
customer identity

828
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
yeah so i think that it really comes

829
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
down to where you sit in the flow so i

830
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,600
want to say that right out the gate

831
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,799
right so

832
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,799
are you at the login box and you stop at

833
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,399
the log on box or do you have the

834
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,799
application um but for something wrist

835
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,960
space i would really look at

836
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
any multiple factor

837
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
that you may have what risk may be

838
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,039
associated with that so if a phone

839
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,880
number is you is being used like for

840
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
passwordless or something

841
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
really really helps to have some intel

842
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
on that so there are lots of great

843
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,720
vendors that provide things like this i

844
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,000
would definitely include that as risk

845
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,120
space

846
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,559
we have

847
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,720
internal machine learning models

848
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,960
which you can actually read about tons

849
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,640
that we have resources that i can give

850
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,039
you after this talk

851
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,399
i would recommend that if you have it

852
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,399
right but like first step is is having

853
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,039
that log data at the ready and if you've

854
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,720
got the data um there are lots of

855
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
predictive tools that would be at your

856
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,919
fingertips are you up here because you

857
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,240
want me to eat

858
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,960
or you just up here to walk it around

859
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
i have consequences for you i'm just

860
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,559
okay if i should ask them hello

861
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,559
afterwards i'm i'm here all day and we

862
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,640
have i think at least a few minutes and

863
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,600
oh yeah yeah i mean i can wait yeah

864
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,120
well it's an interesting topic i can

865
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
tell you that

866
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,559
we've had several talks at pastors.com

867
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,159
before about

868
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,480
protection against

869
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
password spraying financial staffing and

870
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,679
so on

871
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
all talks are available online on

872
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,799
youtube for free

873
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,960
some of these talks were held in

874
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,600
europe over the past few years so

875
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,679
a certain possibility people in the us

876
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,919
haven't seen them and vice versa

877
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,480
but there's some great stuff in there

878
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,720
personally i'm working for a financial

879
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
services company or id provider in

880
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,760
norway and when you use us there's a

881
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
mandatory to find on location

882
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,240
one of the things that we do that i have

883
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
pretty much never seen anyone else do in

884
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
the world and i'm not saying we are

885
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,840
amazing we're just incredibly good

886
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
is the fact that when you log on with us

887
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
you log on in an order that is different

888
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,360
from how much most people do because

889
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,799
usually when we're two-factor on

890
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,279
application you do username

891
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,960
then password and then an otp

892
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,560
we ask username and then otp and otp is

893
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,639
not a push notification to you it's a

894
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,239
hardware device that you have where you

895
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,679
get the pin

896
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
and if you are not able to enter that

897
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,199
you will never get to the password

898
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,239
prompt

899
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,839
so credential stuffing and password

900
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,079
spraying is absolutely pointless towards

901
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,879
us it doesn't work it can't because you

902
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,679
can't get past the otp without actually

903
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,159
coming to norway and stealing a hardware

904
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,520
device from somebody using bank id

905
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
and this is something that you can do at

906
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,239
you know if you have a ubi key

907
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,119
social engineering

908
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,239
you and i just yes

909
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,520
all of twitter

910
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,119
because i

911
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,199
convinced you that i was part of it

912
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,239
did i mention fido web authent as part

913
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,680
of the flow of this

914
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,200
so nope

915
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,119
doesn't work

916
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,560
but i mean this is something that you

917
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,240
can do as easy without you know if you

918
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,880
have a hardware key like ubiqui or a

919
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,800
google titan key or something and you're

920
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,720
using secure shell

921
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
you can set up a pan module in your

922
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,720
linux box saying that whenever i ssh

923
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,040
into my box enter your username and then

924
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,680
they will ask you to use your ub key

925
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
first and if you don't have that or if

926
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
that doesn't work you don't get access

927
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,520
i mean i set this stuff up like

928
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
11 years ago

929
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,000
on my box at home when i got one of the

930
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,839
first ubikeys

931
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,720
made more or less and just for the fun i

932
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
put up a box available on the internet

933
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,640
with telnet and ssh available and i said

934
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,119
use them first and then you need to

935
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,960
authenticate using the otp so i just saw

936
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,880
i don't know how many login attempts and

937
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
all of them fail because you can't get

938
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
past the otp

939
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,640
that's a brilliant way to solve this

940
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,880
well not solve it but at least you're

941
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,400
reducing the uh attack surface

942
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,520
by

943
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,040
huge amounts so it's a good tip

944
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,480
well we

945
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,200
i in my case i decided just to go for

946
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,359
you know only do the ubiqui so no

947
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,720
password at all

948
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,599
but again i run passwords con i have a

949
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,520
passion for passwords i'm saying they

950
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,079
are never going away so i also say that

951
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,160
while having a memorized secret in here

952
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,839
as well is something they really should

953
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,920
have and for those who doesn't remember

954
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,720
what happened to rsa and security

955
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,680
rita

956
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,720
you need a password as well

957
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,160
more questions or comments from the

958
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,119
audience

959
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,720
oh yep

960
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,960
yeah i want to say also i could not

961
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,520
agree more um i wish in the u.s and

962
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,119
internationally we had

963
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,119
is it is it like a requirement in norway

964
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,520
that banks issue that or is it just

965
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,839
totally unique

966
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,119
oh well that makes it easy yeah yeah

967
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,480
your flow your flow is much better yes

968
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,680
yes please

969
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,920
so this is a not exactly a question more

970
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
a comment

971
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,800
because i didn't come here to represent

972
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,480
into intuit but

973
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
in fact

974
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,440
i i knew there would be somebody

975
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,079
in that sense so so we we do have a very

976
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,680
intensive monitoring of what's happening

977
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,520
with our customers and i can tell you

978
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,040
that the thing that you're you're

979
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,280
talking about this mfa is something that

980
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
we are well aware of uh this morning i

981
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,040
just got here late because i was on a

982
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,119
call exactly about this issue

983
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,359
uh you know we have a lot many threats

984
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,720
and many security mechanisms and

985
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,320
everything that we essentially know what

986
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,240
we have to do but you know everything

987
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,920
that we're doing we're doing very slowly

988
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,040
in order to not uh damage or open the

989
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,960
open the door for for additional fraud

990
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
so i

991
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
i'm sorry for what you're experiencing

992
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,480
but uh

993
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,760
you should know that this is something

994
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,320
that is being handled i accept your

995
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
apology and i thank you for your service

996
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,640
uh

997
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,800
[Laughter]

998
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
uh yeah i mean that truly i wasn't

999
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,240
honestly trying to pick on you there's

1000
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
other large us banks that actually do

1001
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,079
the exact same thing and it really

1002
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,400
really drives me nuts in fairness this

1003
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
is like in a small business smb context

1004
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
so i can see why they do it right like

1005
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,440
small business account takeover is a

1006
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
really really big deal and even though

1007
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,079
intuit like ultimately may not be like

1008
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,240
responsible or on the hook you still

1009
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,079
have that duty to your customers and and

1010
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,119
i appreciate that like i i do right um i

1011
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,040
was just being a baby about friction and

1012
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,520
i think that it's more of like a scion

1013
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,160
problem honestly so i don't know that's

1014
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,920
my view i hope that's a little more

1015
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,320
generous

1016
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,880
um i have two questions uh one is uh but

1017
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,480
you said you didn't like the impossible

1018
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,200
use case or impossible impossible

1019
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,680
but i didn't um i didn't get well the

1020
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
reasoning behind or what you don't like

1021
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,839
about it

1022
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,560
and then the second is um do you have

1023
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,880
any good usage use cases for a situation

1024
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,760
where

1025
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,839
somebody an organization is using a soft

1026
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,480
token as their second factor and it's

1027
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,400
compromised

1028
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,160
okay um

1029
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,520
you'll probably have to ask the second

1030
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
one again because by the time i get

1031
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,400
through the first one i'll probably i

1032
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,800
forgot but um what what don't i like

1033
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,599
about impossible travel um if you are a

1034
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,920
provider with a lot of different

1035
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,839
customers and a lot of different places

1036
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,960
with a lot of different use cases um

1037
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,040
i hate to give as an example but you

1038
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,000
know web3 companies that are startups

1039
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
really like to outsource their identity

1040
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,240
because you know they got to move fast

1041
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,720
and like not all web 3 companies are

1042
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,280
good at identity

1043
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,079
but

1044
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,760
what talks about impossible travel for

1045
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,839
them is that a lot of their customers

1046
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,920
are really concerned on privacy do use

1047
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,720
vpns and within the same session lake

1048
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,560
very well may change ips throughout

1049
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,920
countries but

1050
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,520
if you are doing something like

1051
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,000
workforce or finance impossible travel

1052
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
probably makes complete sense honestly

1053
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,200
so

1054
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,040
that's that's what it comes down to i

1055
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
think um is like what is your use case

1056
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,400
what are your trade-offs where's your

1057
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,920
revenue um and so the second question

1058
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
ask it one more time

1059
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,960
um compromise soft tokens uh do you have

1060
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
like use cases to detect

1061
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
you know credential stuffing plus

1062
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,759
compromised software things

1063
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,119
so the question is around like what what

1064
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,079
situations have arisen or

1065
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,480
like what how how do you how to deal

1066
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
with it or

1067
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,119
i'm trying to think as a login box um

1068
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,200
directly and i wish i had an answer

1069
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,960
immediately at hand um you uh

1070
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,119
yeah yeah yeah

1071
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,040
so my question actually ties into his

1072
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,720
question but um we use a siam um

1073
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,880
provider service called glue glue

1074
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,920
identity

1075
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,599
so i was going to ask for your comments

1076
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,599
on that but to speak to his point um

1077
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
glue is actually java based and you

1078
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,800
might have heard of something called

1079
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,520
log4j so um you know

1080
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,640
there's a tie in there did you want to

1081
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,040
comment on this question

1082
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,160
um

1083
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,400
so commonly this question i think that

1084
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
um you know ultimately downstream

1085
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,079
application security is probably where i

1086
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,160
would see that and i know that's not an

1087
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,319
answer that probably satisfies anyone

1088
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,240
but that's the best i can give you yeah

1089
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,040
yeah

1090
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,640
so just wondering if you if you had

1091
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
heard of glue identity and if you have

1092
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
any thoughts on open source uh you know

1093
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,079
providers to help to solve some of these

1094
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,119
problems

1095
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,720
um i don't really have too many thoughts

1096
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,040
on them

1097
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,720
so for workforce protection for

1098
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,839
that use case uh potential could be some

1099
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,480
some providers use kind of like an 802.x

1100
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,319
like mechanism where you have an

1101
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,319
endpoint that's recognized as a friendly

1102
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,400
endpoint and so you can enforce that at

1103
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,240
your organization where you're only

1104
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,000
allowed to actually authenticate with a

1105
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,520
work device that's been proven to be a

1106
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,560
work device

1107
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,839
yeah right yeah workforce is is very

1108
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,520
nice in that you have control over the

1109
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,200
endpoints or could

1110
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,960
at least usually though yeah well yeah

1111
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,200
uh in this world of remote work control

1112
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
is kind of a a weird concept in the

1113
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,759
first place

1114
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,680
okay

1115
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,160
then we're all done thank you for coming

1116
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,280
to peace rights and pass-through scope

1117
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,599
yes thank you for having me it it truly

1118
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,160
was a pleasure um i hope that i get some

1119
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,280
insults from you uh shortly after that

1120
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
we can do insults but now it's lunch

1121
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,839
time and i hope to see you all back at

1122
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,640
two o'clock thank you
