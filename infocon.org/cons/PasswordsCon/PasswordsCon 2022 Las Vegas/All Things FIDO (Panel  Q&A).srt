1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,439
now

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,600
i'm not gonna say i i i know christian

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,200
but we have we have met a couple of

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,440
times and we have talked online as well

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,240
so just still have a certain idea on on

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,639
on your how much of pain in the ass i

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,639
can be asking questions

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
i had dinner with him yesterday and also

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
warned him that i like to do the

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,560
difficult questions and andrew just

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
walked straight into the trap on this

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,690
one

13
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,720
[Laughter]

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,400
so back in norway at one of the

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
universities there there's a biometrics

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
lab that are rated as one of the best in

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,519
the world

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,000
and every time they are want to do a

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,920
pound discussion they

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
contact me because they say that i'm

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
really incredibly good at being the

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
devil's advocate

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
so

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,960
i wanted to start out by saying that

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
on my phone right now

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
i'm actually looking at a couple of

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,079
slides from someone named simon youssef

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,039
son

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,840
at a company called

30
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,079
ubico and these slides are actually from

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
passwords con

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
in june

33
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,600
2011. oh wow

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
in bergen norway

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
where he was presenting the yubikey

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
and very shortly after his talk

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
i purchased my first

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
yubikey

39
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
and this is then

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
11 years old

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,640
so my first question is

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,479
for andrew

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
what's taking you so long

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,079
thank you um how much time do we have

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
before the next session

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,520
well for this session

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
so a great question um

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,479
you know i'd note that so fido alliance

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,600
for those of you don't know we're an

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,119
industry body

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,520
over 250 companies take part uh we're

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
fortunate enough to have

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
all the platforms involved uh yubico

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
security key vendors service providers

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,159
groups like that

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,280
we're coming into our 10th year of

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
existence so this is around 11 years ago

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
that yubago had the idea of the yuba key

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
um i actually think we've made

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
remarkable progress with the fido's

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,159
standards well i mean christian talked

62
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,520
about web off then web authent is

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
supported by

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,639
dozens of leading brands hundreds of

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
millions of consumers can log in

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
re-authenticate without a password

67
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,440
thanks to that

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
what we're hitting though is a point of

69
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
well that's good but to really take on

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,680
passwords and to have the same ubiquity

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
as passwords we need to take on some of

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
the same traits which is easy access

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,879
ubiquitous access and ease of use

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,400
and i could say like today every

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
conversation i have about fino

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
begins and ends with usability and so

77
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
past you know pass keys first and

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
foremost are more usable means of doing

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
passwords authentication which allows us

80
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
to hit our core goal

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
of reducing industry reliance on

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
passwords

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
um so i think we've made good progress

84
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,440
in 10 years actually the fact that we've

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,599
seen such adoption every meaningful

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
company is taking part in fido alliance

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
there's no counter standard to fido

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
because everyone understands that this

89
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
is you know

90
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
fido is basically the ssl of user

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,920
authentication

92
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,599
um it's not it's not critical and i

93
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,720
think we'd have the same approach and

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
we'll have the same success as far as

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
being embedded in every system service

96
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
and platform out there

97
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
um now in regards to yubiko and yuba key

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
as christian was talking about before

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
that's another form factor for doing you

100
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
know fido authentication in fact i would

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
say

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
you know that will remain the gold

103
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
standard from a security standpoint for

104
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,599
fighter authentication there are certain

105
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,599
use cases where a key you know will

106
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
always be used that being said what is

107
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
so exciting about passkey

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,920
is the proposition of taking passwords

109
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,080
out of play entirely for hundreds of

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,799
millions if not billions of consumers

111
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,080
and if someone can't get excited about

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
that i don't know what they're waiting

113
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,319
for

114
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,680
so to answer your question i think we're

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
making good progress passkey stands to

116
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,200
take us to the next level after this

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,350
thank you um okay um

pass keys

124
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
can you explain this to my mom in like a

125
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
sentence

126
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,519
what is this stuff because my mom is

127
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,640
really

128
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
seriously not interested

129
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,879
yeah i mean i think well you know what

130
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,879
christian demoed um

131
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
the way we explain it to folks is that

132
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,399
you're using your screen lock on your

133
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,880
device to sign in everywhere right

134
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,639
that's ultimately the way we abstract it

135
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
away because the same

136
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
tech on the device is being used and all

137
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
of the

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
all the api surface all that's

139
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
completely abstract away from the user

140
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
and that's why we believe having a term

141
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,680
password pass key like password is so

142
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
critical because all we need people to

143
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
do is associate that as they can sign in

144
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
the way we kind of thought about this

145
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,199
was we're about

146
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,440
10 years into tap to pay right i think

147
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
google wallet came out in 2012 apple pay

148
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
was after right like most users know

149
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
what that tap to pay icon means now

150
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
whether it's a physical card tap or a

151
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
phone we need that on the web we need

152
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
that for apps so we need an icon and a

153
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
name that users just know oh all i have

154
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,280
to do is you know i'm going to get

155
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
prompted to to unlock my phone more or

156
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
less to do this or my device i want to

157
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,610
thank you that i i think

[Music]

159
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,639
up until a year ago we we weren't quite

160
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
ready with this experience yet because

161
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,039
we were always thinking a user will have

162
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
to know do i have a password do i have a

163
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,000
pass key i have to make that mental

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
decision and that was actually a big

165
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
flaw right in the in the in the

166
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
development of this it's like users

167
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,199
don't know today if you have a security

168
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,240
key you need to know you have a security

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
key because you need to have it present

170
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
right the thinking with pass keys is

171
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
everything is abstracted away like like

172
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
with a password manager today you just

173
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
go where you want to go you click into

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
the field and whatever is available

175
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
magically pops up and gets presented and

176
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
until we really had that experience

177
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
figured out i think this wasn't really

178
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
ready for prime time but because we now

179
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,039
have it we're hoping that it is yeah

180
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,240
um okay uh christian um

181
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,080
throughout the years i've seen all kinds

182
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,960
of

183
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
authentication schemes come up and fall

184
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
down like dead flies in in seconds

185
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,639
i've got to be honest i do have

186
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,800
a certain level of faith in fighter web

187
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,560
offend but again i'm here for being the

188
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,759
devil's advocate so i've seen

189
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
facebook uh tried to push through vital

190
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,919
on location a couple of years ago

191
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,000
and one of the things i got fascinated

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,919
when facebook was really pushing to have

193
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,319
authentication is that

194
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
after enabling 2000 authentication

195
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,360
you would get a pop-up for like every

196
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,039
time you logged in for a period of at

197
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
least two weeks

198
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
where they said

199
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
you have unable to find a vacation would

200
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
you like to turn it off

201
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,319
and i was like wait what

202
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
i do know people on facebook sorry i

203
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
asked about this and they said well it's

204
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
pretty simple pair when you have

205
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,800
1.5 billion users in the world

206
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
there are gonna be some people that are

207
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,360
clueless absolutely clueless to what

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
they just did

209
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,240
so they they had to do that just to make

210
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
sure that people

211
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,840
at some level knew what they were

212
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,479
doing apple have also tried to push the

213
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
adoption of your authentication for your

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
apple account

215
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
google is pushing the advanced

216
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,319
protection program

217
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,560
will google

218
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
when will you try to push

219
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
the use of fido web or then onto users

220
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
like to make it mandatory for let's say

221
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
just a couple of million users just to

222
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,560
see what happens that's a great question

223
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
um i was looking for the meme but then i

224
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
decided no i have too many tabs open on

225
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280
my browser i don't want to go there i

226
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
was looking for that meme with a guy

227
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,599
riding the bike and then putting the

228
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,759
stick into the wheel right i feel like

229
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,440
that is what facebook was doing when

230
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
they they tried to get like q factor

231
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,479
authentication adapted and then giving

232
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,080
users these options to keep turning

233
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,919
things off oh honestly the question kind

234
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
of twofold the first is google is on a

235
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,240
journey to enable two-factor

236
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
authentication managery for a billion

237
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
users doesn't matter if you want it or

238
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
not you're going to get it and i mean

239
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,440
apple is already into a certain extent

240
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
done some of that stuff on the icloud

241
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
side right today it's very very hard if

242
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,479
you have an icloud account it's hard to

243
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,080
turn off two factors to get an icloud

244
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
account right there was never an

245
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
explicit moment where i turned 2fa on my

246
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,039
icloud account but it's been there for

247
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,400
as long as i can remember and that's a

248
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,440
conscious choice in the conscious

249
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
decision they made we're doing the same

250
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,879
thing i think we just publicized it

251
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,800
we've enabled it for i think 150 million

252
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
users you go look at the google blogs uh

253
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
google two-factor like you'll see some

254
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
uh stuff that we've said about like

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,479
successfully testing this out like we we

256
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,199
took 150 million users we've enabled 25

257
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,720
authentication for them we looked at

258
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
their account health over like a six

259
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,759
month period and see what happened can

260
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,520
they still log in can't they log in okay

261
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,679
i will say i'll i'll cover this with

262
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,279
that was like a pretty good group of

263
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,200
users we pick right they have recovery

264
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,719
options there's other things that's good

265
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,399
about their accounts that made us want

266
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,399
to go and pick them but

267
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
it worked out and we're definitely on a

268
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
journey to get two-factor authentication

269
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,279
in general to more users now let's talk

270
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,279
about web author the reason why my

271
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,720
counterparts in google on the account

272
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
side is so excited about web authentic

273
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,839
you can sell level 10 as a usability

274
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
benefit right you can't it's hard to

275
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
sell two-factor as a usability benefit

276
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
right it really is purely a security

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
benefits don't care they're like you

278
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
should keep me safe they're really angry

279
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
at you when you let someone else get

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
into their account but for the most part

281
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,959
they don't want to deal with it right

282
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,399
they're more angry if you lock them out

283
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,839
i mean that's obviously the worst right

284
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
so lockout is bad getting someone else

285
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
to their account bad and then of course

286
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
for the rest of it they don't want to

287
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
deal with it the way that we're thinking

288
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
about positioning web of n is exactly

289
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,480
what we've seen in that in that banking

290
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
demo you'll sign into your google

291
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
account one day and you'll just get a

292
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
message that says hey you happen to be

293
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,519
on a device with a biometric sensor like

294
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,040
you can have a fingerprint face or

295
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
whatever do you want to use that to make

296
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
your signing process easier in the

297
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,399
future and then the user says yes now

298
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,480
they have a pass key now that is that is

299
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
the experience that we're thinking about

300
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,200
for google accounts that is the

301
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
experience that actually um many

302
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
apps have been have been you know

303
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,279
pushing users towards for the last

304
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,360
almost decade right if you log into your

305
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
chase or bank of america or whoever like

306
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
into your banking app today that's the

307
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
way that the app up sells you hey you

308
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
want to use biometrics in the future i

309
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
mean i'm not always a fan of the

310
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
exact user experience and how slick it

311
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is but what we want to do is make it

312
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
extremely easy for users and have the

313
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
value proposition center around

314
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,040
usability and ease of use and not around

315
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
security of course it's massive for

316
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,360
security but that's not what users i

317
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
think in general really care that much

318
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
about

319
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,480
sort of tempting to to ask tim the same

320
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
question i

321
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,399
i can't really remember seeing microsoft

322
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,279
doing a very significant very visible

323
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,079
push for 200 to the identification

324
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,399
but uh are you planning to sort of push

325
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,640
fighter web off and on to us and is that

326
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
going to be voluntary or by

327
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
false i'll take one little brag we were

328
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
the first of the three to allow you to

329
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,040
remove your password completely

330
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
that was about a year ago and that's

331
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
been wildly successful yeah we were

332
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
certainly thinking about the day when we

333
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
would mandate 2sv um

334
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,760
and that would be most likely to be a

335
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
pass key or security keys um so it's

336
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
certainly top of mind this is a as

337
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,880
christian mentioned right this is a

338
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
journey this these releases that you're

339
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
going to see very shortly this is not

340
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
the end right we're going to constantly

341
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
improve and you know it's it's going to

342
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,920
be you know it's going to be

343
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,320
realistically about 12 to 18 months

344
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,399
before you know we can really start to

345
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
push this on these big accounts yeah

346
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
andrew i mean

347
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
what are you doing from from fighter

348
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
line centrally to sort of like

349
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
i don't know can you ask all the members

350
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,720
of fighter alliance to push this stuff

351
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,800
at the same time so we get the

352
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
maximum attention to it oh yeah i'm

353
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,399
going to do that yeah so a couple points

354
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,360
here so first of all i think the

355
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,959
questions are fascinating because to me

356
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,880
they're all about usability the question

357
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,959
to tim the question about your mom or

358
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,880
whoever might be

359
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
my mom is incredibly difficult on this

360
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,920
your mom but like it's always your mom

361
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
or whatever it is but you know

362
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,279
it's that that proverbial person but

363
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
it's all about usability and to that

364
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
person it's it's like

365
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
you know apple has done a great service

366
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
of the industry by introducing touch id

367
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
and apple basically consumerized user

368
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
authentication with touch id and people

369
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
are so accustomed now to using

370
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
biometrics that's the expectation of

371
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
user experience

372
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
the facebook

373
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
experiment with trying to mandate uh

374
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
two-factor authentication and sticking

375
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
the

376
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
stick and the smoke that's usability

377
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
challenge and these are not technical

378
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,959
challenges so again as i said before

379
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,240
pretty much every conversation i have

380
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
about fido these days begins and ends

381
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
with usability which was not the case

382
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,480
12 months ago it was about security um

383
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
and all the benefits of usability

384
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
actually have obviously security

385
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
implications as well they have uh bottom

386
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,040
line benefits and top line benefits too

387
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
and so to your question of can we just

388
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
make people do this well no we can't

389
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
but the fact of the matter is you know

390
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
on may 5th of this year

391
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
we had a press announcement

392
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
with apple google microsoft and fido

393
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,079
alliance

394
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
where all three platforms

395
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,160
announced their commitment to support

396
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,040
this

397
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
vision of past keys

398
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
and you know we can't do much better

399
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
than that right and all three platforms

400
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
are going to support this starting with

401
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,800
ios and mac os this year following with

402
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
android and

403
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
windows over the next 12 to 18 months so

404
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,040
i think that as that endpoint support

405
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,959
becomes more and more prevalent we will

406
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
see the service providers

407
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
you know go towards pass keys and

408
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
there's a lot of discussions right now

409
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
about how and when and why they need to

410
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,079
do it

411
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
to be clear as tim just pointed out like

412
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
this is a technology

413
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
in development right so the technology

414
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
is mature right it will be it's already

415
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,399
out in ios and beta form right now but

416
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,000
like any new technology

417
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
it does need to iterate it will iterate

418
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
based on market feedback based on market

419
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
forces and we're taking you know that

420
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
feedback's happening organically and

421
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,199
also through the alliance itself so that

422
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
pass key over time will become more and

423
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,519
more

424
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
um you know better tuned

425
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
and also fit all market demands

426
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,880
one other point that we're doing inside

427
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,639
of fido alliance you know we're not just

428
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,880
hearing about usability we're actually

429
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
embracing it as a standards organization

430
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
to everything we do so we have a ux

431
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,000
committee we have a ux system coming

432
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
into place looking at user experience at

433
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
every step of the way across our

434
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
specifications and across the outputs so

435
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
pass key will be front and center but

436
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,839
we're also looking at things like ux for

437
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,920
security keys and other deployments of

438
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,720
photo authentication

439
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
how can we again the usability is a very

440
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,440
good point i do have a t-shirt today a

441
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
friend in israel avid

442
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
called

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,880
security digger sektiga on twitter he

444
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,000
has a rule avid's rule he says security

445
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,880
at the expense of usability comes at the

446
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,360
expense of security

447
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
it's a really good one

448
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,360
um

449
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,120
is fido you know is it easy for normal

450
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
people just to get started or do we

451
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
actually have to do any kind of training

452
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
to get them stuck with this i mean again

453
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
back to my mom can she figure this stuff

454
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
out without any kind of training at all

455
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,639
because training is a cost so let me

456
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,160
talk about the user perspective then

457
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
turn over to tim and christian talk

458
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
about the you know the developers

459
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,279
perspective so one month in again is a

460
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
remarkable um

461
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
api and it's built in every browser and

462
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
anyone could basically deploy it today

463
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
for you know use of platform

464
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,680
authenticators that being said um you

465
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
know we heard from service providers

466
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
like hey this is really exciting but

467
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,680
like

468
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,279
there's some wonky stuff happening with

469
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
like os prompts and browser prompts and

470
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
like we don't know if this is being how

471
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
do we deploy this as we actually did our

472
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,600
first ux study last year we hired a

473
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
external ux firm

474
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,839
we had a ux we had a committee

475
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
led by you know not your typical

476
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
standards walks but by

477
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
ux and design leads from companies like

478
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,000
visa and apple and intuit and jpmorgan

479
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
chase who helps scope a study

480
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
the three-part study of both um

481
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
moderated unmoderated testing of people

482
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,839
actually

483
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,519
trying to enroll

484
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
and leverage a platform authenticator to

485
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
log in

486
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
to a site supporting web authen and we

487
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,839
learned so much from that and it's

488
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,519
fascinating watching users do things

489
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399
like try to use touch id on a macbook to

490
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
log into if it ditches bank site and

491
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
watching like this focus group someone

492
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
being like wait a second like

493
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
why does it want my fingerprint and why

494
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,839
is this bank with my fingerprint and why

495
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,199
do they want this and so what we learned

496
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
is that there's a lot of education that

497
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
needs to happen about like hey first of

498
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
all your fingerprints not leaving

499
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,360
but also all the user flows they're in

500
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,199
and most of the design stuff that we

501
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,440
figured out was not about

502
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,519
iconography and colors and stuff like

503
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,839
that it's about terminology

504
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,360
and getting information across

505
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
effectively and letting people know

506
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
what's happening and like selectively

507
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
disclosing information as they go along

508
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,880
to help walk them through the entire

509
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
user journey from being primed

510
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
to enroll for a web app then

511
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
for your account on through to login and

512
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
customer support and stuff like that so

513
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,480
there's a lot of science behind this and

514
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,079
we're trying to take that on as a body

515
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
and then making these guidelines freely

516
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
available to anyone to use which they

517
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,399
are

518
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,720
today and they are being utilized uh

519
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,399
usability studies on this before we move

520
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,079
on to christian just an additional

521
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,920
follow-up on last one

522
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,079
usability studies in the us

523
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,120
fine

524
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,559
i'm from norway

525
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,160
and i will make the claim there are

526
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
social and cultural differences between

527
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
well different cultures uh different

528
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
countries across borders across

529
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
nations everything

530
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
have this been tested out in european

531
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,359
countries has been tested out in germany

532
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,000
which are just a tad more privacy

533
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
concern than anyone else in the world

534
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,079
i just want to ask that before android

535
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,600
artists i will say we're seeing

536
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,360
statistically significant difference in

537
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,919
in pass rates users being able to pass

538
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,200
this and looking at different

539
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
jurisdictions so absolutely there is

540
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
definitely differences that we see in

541
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,840
ways that we need to approach that

542
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
yeah

543
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
okay uh anything more to add to this you

544
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,360
know how to do you want to talk about

545
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
the developer side

546
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
but we can go to the technical side as

547
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
well it's a good point

548
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
yeah i mean i mean even just high level

549
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,600
for developers right

550
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
all of everything that you saw um today

551
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
was very minor tweaks to the existing

552
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
502 web app then stack right we the the

553
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
autofill is literally adding a new tag

554
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,559
to a username field the cross device

555
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,480
thing is not something you as a relying

556
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
party or website have to implement

557
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
that's all handled by the platform all

558
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
that magic is handled um at that c-tap

559
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
layer that christian uh mentioned client

560
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
authenticator protocol um and so one

561
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
thing that we think is different here is

562
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,000
that we have a very very

563
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
clean specific use case now right which

564
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
when all these specifications came out

565
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,600
right there was you know if you've ever

566
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,039
read any spec right you know they're

567
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,480
they're very hard to read right no

568
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,799
matter how hard we know how hard we try

569
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
to to to make them easier to read and

570
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
i'm one of the people who write some of

571
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
them um they're just they're too big

572
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
they're hard for a developer to pick up

573
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
and so what's unique here is you know

574
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,480
the goal that we have for some

575
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,799
new developer resources is that if a

576
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,760
developer that has a site that the only

577
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,880
reason they added sms otp or email magic

578
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
link was because they're you know they

579
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
were told you know passwords are

580
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
fishable and we can't have that they

581
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
should be able to go to the site and

582
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,480
implement pass keys without ever picking

583
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
up the web authentic right that's the

584
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
goal right like we never we may not even

585
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,000
link to it that's what we're thinking

586
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
and that that would that didn't that

587
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,280
really wasn't possible before because

588
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
there's just when you when you start

589
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,760
looking at a spec like that there's so

590
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
many different use cases it's addressing

591
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,160
and we really have a very clean very

592
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
boxed in use case here that applies to

593
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
nearly everyone and the other dimension

594
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,840
to it is we didn't have any good

595
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,120
libraries at the time right there were

596
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
some like reference implementations but

597
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
again they served either not enough use

598
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,600
cases or too many use cases there's a

599
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,559
one

600
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,960
one specific library called simple web

601
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
authent that is already ready for all

602
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,480
this pesky stuff we found a bug in it

603
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,400
last week it was fixed in two days right

604
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
we have amazing libraries that no one

605
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
has to go write this stuff themselves

606
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
anymore and we think that that's a

607
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
that's a big change from the first

608
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,400
go-around with trying to get folks to

609
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
implement this and when why do i then

610
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,640
have developers telling me that

611
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
implementing this stuff

612
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,919
is difficult

613
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
no i and i think it was and i think what

614
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
we're hoping is because we have kind of

615
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
a big a big package now that can be

616
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
whether it's the sdk whether it's the

617
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
docs everything should be ready to go

618
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
and and much easier to implement and

619
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
dive into initially than it was before

620
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
and that's from microsoft's perspective

621
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,400
it's easy

622
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
yeah these resources are actually a

623
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
collaboration between fidel and the

624
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
three companies so okay sure that's

625
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
certainly my perspective but i i think i

626
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,600
think the dots aren't being connected

627
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
quite yet and that is definitely i mean

628
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
i'm i'm talking to internal business

629
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,760
development relationship folks on google

630
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,080
this week finally where we're saying all

631
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,919
right we can now take a breather most of

632
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
the technology pieces are now there and

633
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
we're on our journey and by the way

634
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
apple mentioned that by the end of the

635
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,640
year they want to have their releases

636
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,320
out we're on the same time frame right

637
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,880
so um on the android side by the end of

638
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,600
this year we're sincerely hoping that we

639
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
have a release out there that is not

640
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
only ready for testing but is actually

641
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
ready for developing and deploying

642
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
against so so uh many of the things that

643
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,600
i've that i've shown i mean all of the

644
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
stuff that i showed is a real live

645
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
running code right nothing there was

646
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
mocked up it was real code um it was you

647
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,559
know behind some flags and experiments

648
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,799
but but but the pitch is these things

649
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,480
should be ready by the end of the year

650
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,400
um there there should not be a reason

651
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,159
why developers you know can't get access

652
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,440
to that and then on the other side get

653
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,799
access to the resources but like i said

654
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
about the dots i don't think developers

655
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
know that you can go and look at this

656
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,440
great new library over here and you

657
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,640
should be looking at this docs error

658
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
here people google web of then they get

659
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,679
to the spec and they're like what the

660
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,360
hell is this and i think that that

661
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
really is something that we need to

662
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
address so back to my business folks

663
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
it's like we want to try and make it

664
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
easy like if we can get

665
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,120
relationships started with the

666
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,039
developers and i mean that includes the

667
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,799
top 100 apps but it includes also all of

668
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,480
the long tail like how does someone pick

669
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
this stuff up the last thing i'll add is

670
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,960
um whereas we need to make sure there is

671
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
messages for developers or messaging for

672
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,799
developers i think we've already lost if

673
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,640
we need to pitch this to end users right

674
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
if we need to go pitch the value

675
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
proposition like today with security

676
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,280
keys you need to take an action you need

677
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,720
to buy one then you need to go and

678
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,080
navigate on a website and look for

679
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
multi-factor options and look for

680
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
security keys if this is the way that

681
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,480
the web design is going to be deployed

682
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
it'll be a huge failure in my opinion

683
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,919
right web of n should be deployed the

684
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,880
way that

685
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,159
biomedical authentication works today

686
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
which is as a matter of course when

687
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
you're just interacting with the product

688
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,919
there should be an upsell it should be

689
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
easy to understand in plain language one

690
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,919
to two sentences at most and it should

691
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
start working no one should go digging

692
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,679
through settings to enable an account

693
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,360
for web authentic because that already

694
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
means you need this cognitive kind of

695
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
understanding of how things interact but

696
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
that is not the way that we're thinking

697
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,520
right and one example of this there's a

698
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,600
there's a very large retailer in the us

699
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,960
which we're super excited they rolled

700
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
out web authentic but guess what their

701
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
login page says signed in with web

702
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,000
authent like that's what the button says

703
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,919
yeah like what who knows what that means

704
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,880
right like

705
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
as a user

706
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,280
that's right they were first right no

707
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,240
and that's what i mean we are super

708
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
happy they implemented it but that that

709
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,400
highlighted a market problem which we

710
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
was the reason we needed a generic term

711
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,840
like pascal

712
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
but you said that you know people will

713
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,360
just google for web authent and then

714
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
they find the standard and they will say

715
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,640
you know what the hell is this exactly i

716
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,960
well you're the owners of the search

717
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,200
engine so i assume something could be

718
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,559
done we don't have control over the

719
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,280
search engine results remember but yes

720
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,559
yeah

721
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,320
it's just living his own life so yeah

722
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,559
but one one side effect which i think is

723
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,039
good like inside phyto alliance like the

724
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,039
like within what three weeks after we

725
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,360
started using the term pass key we

726
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,799
didn't hear web off then again everyone

727
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,320
was saying past keys so that's a nice

728
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
thing

729
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,799
hopefully people are actually finding

730
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
the pesky resources not web

731
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,880
yeah i mean to be clear we actually

732
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
invested in uh

733
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
creating kind of a consumer brand option

734
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
for fido so we had sign in with phyto

735
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,760
buttons

736
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,039
which is i still think better than

737
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,559
simon's web off then whatever so the

738
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,159
market but the market didn't accept it

739
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,080
which is fine you know and we have a

740
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,279
mark with that but we put it out there

741
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,880
as a straw man the market didn't accept

742
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
it and that's fine

743
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,520
you know but we understood there needs

744
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
to be a name for something right and so

745
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,480
we do think that pasqui as a noun will

746
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
be that name yeah but but that's what i

747
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,559
want to i want to i mean the reason why

748
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,000
we're here is like i want to also put it

749
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
out to the room here the folks here are

750
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
the like this is our ambassadors like

751
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,679
hopefully like help us in getting the

752
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,840
word out like resources and developer

753
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
efforts and libraries like i mean that

754
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
is really what we need we can put forth

755
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
like our perspective and and you know

756
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,799
collectively maybe our three

757
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,279
organizations but um we will really only

758
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,760
have success if this is like i was like

759
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
a grassroot efforts between everyone

760
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
involved and the the experts in this

761
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
area kind of like using the technology

762
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
making it their own and releasing their

763
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,760
own artifacts like that is how we get

764
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
success here i think anyone in the

765
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
audience would like to ask questions

766
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
well but that i didn't have to ask that

767
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,760
question

768
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,480
any developers that are thinking about

769
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
implementing web both then but they

770
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,240
would like to ask a couple of questions

771
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
on you know how do i do this or if you

772
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
find it difficult raise your hand

773
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
yep okay

774
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,879
i can't hear you

775
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
hi i'm a developer

776
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,440
i i read a little bit about uh fido on

777
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,120
the web as a lot i'm gonna go and give

778
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,039
it a try on a demo and that kind of

779
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,640
drowned in the commentation it was like

780
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,880
a month and a half ago i was like oh my

781
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,120
god i'm not going anywhere here so i i

782
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,520
think you guys doing a great job

783
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,799
but

784
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,840
maybe

785
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
make it easier for the developers that

786
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,880
would be great but uh

787
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,480
and also i'm very happy that you guys

788
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
came here but i'm missing one uh big

789
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
actor it would be nice if apple was here

790
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,559
too to get some bit of people checked

791
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,960
twitter and like like it it's not

792
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
anything but like we're still in a

793
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,080
position where it's hard for folks to

794
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,520
travel and things like that but we're

795
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,120
still in a pandemic yeah

796
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
yeah but uh when you say we want people

797
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
to collaborate maybe we should be giving

798
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
people like the idea of community like

799
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,159
the final community so people feel like

800
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,480
they can so that's actually so the the

801
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,400
actually the the the developer resources

802
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
that i'm talking about which will end up

803
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
being passkeys.dev will be the website

804
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
once it's live that's actually being

805
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
driven by a community group in the w3c

806
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
called the web authentication group

807
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,559
which maybe we'll need to rename the

808
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,000
pesky adapter

809
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
but that is actually anyone you know

810
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,400
anyone can join we meet every two weeks

811
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
and actually it's myself and matt miller

812
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
from cisco who is actually we're

813
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,559
actually taking the output of that group

814
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,279
feedback resources and building out this

815
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,120
developer resource center so please i

816
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,679
can i can uh yeah if you google web

817
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,640
thing community adoption group it'll

818
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
come right up that's another thing web

819
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
off and it's a bad word yeah no i know

820
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,679
and that's what i'm saying we probably

821
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,200
need to rename it yeah yeah that's an

822
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,039
artifact of the past i guess

823
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
but that is but we are we do have a i

824
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
would say a pretty good sense of

825
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
community in that group there's also

826
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,080
there's also a uh where's this thing

827
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,000
it's also a fido dev uh mail list if

828
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
you're if you're onto issues so pretty

829
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,120
it's not a

830
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
super vibrant group but there there is a

831
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
fido dev google group that you can mail

832
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
to if you run the issues as well

833
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
yeah next

834
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,520
hello i just had one question to make

835
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,880
sure i'm understanding the security

836
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,039
model around the pass keys right so

837
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,600
the web authent u2f more specifically i

838
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,000
guess is a very decentralized security

839
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,279
model right the private key doesn't

840
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,000
leave the security token concept right

841
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
this is now a switch over to

842
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,240
the credentials are essentially being

843
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,559
managed by the vendor right so there is

844
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
a shift there i think mentally that we

845
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
need to make sure we're okay with or

846
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
we're thinking about the implications of

847
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,279
that

848
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
is that an accurate way to capture it

849
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,039
yeah i don't know i i mean

850
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,480
let me give you my my perspective on

851
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
this right so so uh

852
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,200
yes to a certain extent i think i think

853
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,279
we were trying to figure out

854
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,799
in which way

855
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,000
what are different ways in which we can

856
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,399
address this right um the the challenge

857
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,399
around every single time you buy a new

858
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,919
device we're gonna know you're gonna be

859
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,200
up quick right and that's

860
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
essentially what happens in the current

861
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,279
model and that's also what happens to

862
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,399
the physical authenticator when you lose

863
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,399
that authenticator you're so dead right

864
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,559
so now we recommend get you i mean okay

865
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
that's maybe for like for folks who's

866
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,720
like well let's go bye i mean that's

867
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,559
fine but in a general consumer adoption

868
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
thing we looked at what already has

869
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,679
traction and what attraction is password

870
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,520
managers right also not the level of

871
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
traction we really want them to have but

872
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,039
but they have traction and it's because

873
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
of synchronization we then looked at

874
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
what is the best kind of like line that

875
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,799
we can weave through here which is like

876
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,640
don't place this as files on disk like

877
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,559
have the os like kind of mediate the

878
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,240
access to them there are certain

879
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,520
additional security properties but

880
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
you're right it looks if you squint at

881
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,480
it it looks a little bit more like

882
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,840
federation than what werewolf and used

883
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
to look it still isn't quite federation

884
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
because it's still a direct two-party

885
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
relationship right it's between the

886
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,960
authenticator and the developer yes

887
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,559
there is another third party like

888
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,840
meddling here in the middle now which is

889
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,279
doing the synchronization but if you

890
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,360
think about it google has

891
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
a thousand folks that is purely tasked

892
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
with making sure that bad guys don't get

893
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,080
into good use of google accounts right

894
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
you're now leveraging if you're if

895
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,840
you're using pass keys in this way

896
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,360
you're essentially leveraging the fact

897
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,200
that we're already have all that

898
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
protection and all that investment and

899
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
making sure only the right users get

900
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,679
access to the right google accounts

901
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
you're leveraging that no it might be

902
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,279
that you have a particular use case

903
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,399
where

904
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,159
excuse me even that level isn't good

905
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
enough you need to take responsibility

906
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,480
of your own you know

907
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,200
i i guess like uh direction here and if

908
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
that's what you want to do there are

909
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,960
certain things in the specification that

910
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,120
allows you more granularity where you

911
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
don't have to rely on synchronization i

912
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
will say use that with caution because

913
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
that what that will mean is when the

914
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
user changes to a new device they're

915
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,039
gonna have to start over and unless you

916
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
have a good story there and i and i

917
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,000
think that's another i didn't want to

918
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
get into that because that's kind of

919
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
like where some of the viewpoints

920
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,679
between like what google's doing

921
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,279
microsoft doing and apple doing differs

922
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,880
a little bit it's like how much of that

923
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,039
control do we give developers and how

924
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,640
much of that of control do we give

925
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,799
developers in the initial release we're

926
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,600
very worried that this might go away

927
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,320
where the usability suffers because of a

928
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,960
perceived security look at per shirt

929
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
right i mean that's exactly that right

930
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,399
we we shouldn't all be trying to dial

931
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
this up to 11 because of some perceived

932
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,600
risk and then in the meantime usability

933
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,679
software no one uses the technology so i

934
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,279
i'm being a little vague here but i just

935
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
want to mention yes you're taking a new

936
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
like a new uh anyway i'll stop talking

937
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,279
on this but i'll say you are you aren't

938
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,080
taking another uh um you know

939
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,559
an initial dependency but i think it's a

940
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,720
net positive and not a net negative yeah

941
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
i'd say the same thing so one had a

942
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,120
point i want to make is so

943
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,279
it does change phyto security posture

944
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,480
fundamentally

945
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
but i want to point out this was not

946
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
done without a lot of deliberation and a

947
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,960
lot of conversation internally it wasn't

948
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,679
done flippantly or without a lot of a

949
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,240
lot of a lot of conversation ultimately

950
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
as christian said it's the greater good

951
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,159
right so our goal fido's mission since

952
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,679
day one has been to

953
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,080
reduce reliance on passwords

954
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,919
and this stands to do that taking again

955
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,559
passwords out of play for so many

956
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
consumer use cases

957
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,600
um that we decided that this change is

958
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
is worth it and that being said also

959
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
there are ways to work on this spec you

960
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,840
can you can actually still using passkey

961
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,200
allow for some device-bound

962
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
characteristics

963
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
additionally you know for specialized

964
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,880
use cases enterprise i.t

965
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
highly regulated use cases and so on so

966
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
forth fido security keys will still be

967
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
the default go-to approach and that

968
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,880
won't change

969
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
and just um one other important thing

970
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
right um the pass keys in your account

971
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
will be intend encrypted right so that's

972
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,399
an encrypted blob to google microsoft

973
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,440
and apple

974
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
they're entering encrypted like other

975
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,519
indent encrypted data so yes we manage

976
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,880
how they get down to the device but you

977
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,279
have to unlock them right and analyze

978
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
your policies

979
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,640
um yeah so i was i was wondering what um

980
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
what are the um

981
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,960
what have you been discussing regarding

982
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,200
um account recovery

983
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,760
um when it comes to this and like

984
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
the issues with vendor lock-in that

985
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
arise as a result of

986
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,840
putting the authentication in the device

987
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,279
that's a great question i'll try and

988
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,720
briefly just answer this in case you

989
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,679
know some of my colleagues here also

990
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,000
want to get in but i i think um you're

991
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,080
absolutely right this this

992
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,880
this

993
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,559
again hinges on the fact that like with

994
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
many other user data like you you have

995
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
data there is data now that's sitting

996
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,279
somewhere and you need to like with any

997
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,200
other data it's your data right you need

998
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,120
to have the ability to get that data out

999
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,640
of the ecosystem if you ever want to

1000
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
move somewhere else we definitely

1001
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,640
recognize that um you know how we do

1002
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
that in a secure way with passwords it's

1003
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
kind of like a little easier because we

1004
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,399
all know passwords are like effie and

1005
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,000
you know you have other second factors

1006
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
but like i said if we want past keys to

1007
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,039
be something where you don't necessarily

1008
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,960
need a second factor now suddenly that

1009
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,880
bar is high right and what do you do now

1010
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,960
apple and google have both said i mean

1011
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,200
apple has their white paper on

1012
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,440
essentially how the passkey mechanism

1013
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,279
works they also have the one i call you

1014
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,279
know keychain encryption google will do

1015
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,799
the same thing right so we will also

1016
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,000
like like them said like it's going to

1017
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
be end to end encrypted um

1018
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,600
we're already they're very very similar

1019
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
to ike like keychain um firstly you need

1020
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,120
access to the google account now we are

1021
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,159
driving

1022
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,840
we're trying to drive

1023
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
a multi-factor adoption of google

1024
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,760
accounts um

1025
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
by default right and that's not an

1026
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,279
accident that is that is part of the

1027
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,799
foundation what you really need for this

1028
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,320
to be successful right it doesn't help

1029
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,840
to say pass keys is good a second factor

1030
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,159
but then the recovery is a single factor

1031
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,519
thing that someone can just guess right

1032
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,120
so that needs to be solved number one

1033
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,320
the second thing that needs to be solved

1034
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,600
is or the second thing that we're doing

1035
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
is similar to apple um just having

1036
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
access to the account is not enough um

1037
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,880
you also need to have access to some

1038
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,240
other information the information that

1039
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,679
apple chose the information that google

1040
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,200
is choosing to do is you need to know

1041
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,960
how to unlock one of the devices that

1042
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,360
was previously part of your call it sync

1043
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
fabric like whatever that local lock

1044
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
screen that's actually used as a derived

1045
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,559
key for as part of the end-to-end

1046
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,200
encryption mechanism that we use um so

1047
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,919
we think mandatory like usb which we're

1048
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,640
trying to like drive in plus that factor

1049
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
plus all the other additional i mean i

1050
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,480
had a slide that i didn't show here but

1051
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
like if you think about it over 99.9 of

1052
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,960
automated attacks where an attacker has

1053
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,799
your correct google password will block

1054
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,399
we won't allow them in because there are

1055
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,399
so many other things that we know about

1056
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,760
attackers and where they come from and

1057
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,000
how they look so all of that benefits

1058
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,679
are there and on top of that we then

1059
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,519
layer the 2sv we layer the the

1060
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,279
additional like screen unlock so we

1061
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,000
think we have a very a pretty strong and

1062
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,240
a pretty robust system if after that you

1063
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
say no no i still need additional

1064
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,279
security for my use cases there are

1065
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,039
things in the spec that enable that but

1066
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,119
i think for most relying parties we're

1067
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,079
hoping that that where we've set the bar

1068
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
is essentially where we'd like to where

1069
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,599
we'd like to keep it i'll get in front

1070
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,119
of one question just briefly by also

1071
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,119
saying we're not saying this has to be

1072
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
keys always stored in apple or it has to

1073
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,879
be keys always start in google that is

1074
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,119
our initial implementation but we are

1075
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,639
very much of the opinion that we need to

1076
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,679
do what we've done with password

1077
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,440
managers and we need to make

1078
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,119
an open user choice right if you want to

1079
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,440
use a credential called credential

1080
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
manager password manager a third-party

1081
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,239
one we need to allow for good pluggable

1082
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,918
architectures to make that possible but

1083
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,320
you can imagine how much more complex

1084
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,399
that decision tree now is for a relying

1085
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,560
party or a developer because google

1086
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,399
end-to-end encrypts does

1087
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
password manager xyz end-to-end

1088
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
interrupt what is their security

1089
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,560
properties when it comes to account

1090
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
recovery so all these things have to be

1091
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,719
taken into account um we think we have

1092
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,800
solutions but we would actually love to

1093
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,880
have a separate conversation about those

1094
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,800
kind of things with folks providing

1095
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,160
password managers and credential

1096
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
managers so that we can design the

1097
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,599
system in a way that makes sense for

1098
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,680
developers and for users and even in the

1099
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,200
short term right if you if you look at i

1100
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,320
would recommend looking at some of the

1101
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,000
apple's demos right apple's done a

1102
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
fantastic job about merging like you can

1103
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
have your pass keys in icloud keychain

1104
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,200
but using lastpass for your passwords

1105
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,720
and they all come up in the same ui and

1106
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
you just pick which one you want to use

1107
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,280
right so there's also the convergence

1108
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,200
there in i would say what is the short

1109
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
term until we have a fully pluggable

1110
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,880
model where you can punch your pass keys

1111
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
over to lastpass or whatever password

1112
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440
you want yeah so uh questionnaire from

1113
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,880
twitter

1114
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,440
what is fido doing to continue to

1115
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,920
provide high security authentication

1116
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
with the introduction of pass keys that

1117
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
are lower security

1118
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,359
loan security i take offense but i will

1119
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,200
i think i think we kind of hit on that

1120
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,000
right so yeah i also disagree with low

1121
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,680
on security for all the reasons that we

1122
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,800
just talked about so there's a

1123
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,720
difference thank you twitter user yes

1124
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,320
but i think

1125
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,480
yes it's a different model and again i

1126
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
think that um

1127
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
you know i like to say that fido can

1128
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,920
address address a whole range of use

1129
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,800
cases

1130
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
right so again if you know we have a

1131
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,640
very robust certification program we

1132
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,839
actually certify authenticators at

1133
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,839
different levels uh to protect you know

1134
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,520
to verify that a

1135
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
physical authenticator protects against

1136
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
malware attacks or brute force attacks

1137
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
or hardware attacks you know so if

1138
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,839
that's your use case you can use one of

1139
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,480
these certified authenticators for that

1140
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
i think again the base level fido

1141
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,200
security key uh will remain you know the

1142
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,560
default go to

1143
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
for you know high security

1144
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,200
profile use cases now beyond that again

1145
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
i think the the security properties of

1146
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,119
pesky are not weak they're not weak at

1147
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,280
all and there's you know in fact i was

1148
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
talking this morning

1149
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,800
uh with the head of authentication at a

1150
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
major uh bank in the us i was like hey

1151
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,200
how are you guys looking to pass key

1152
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,240
what do you think about this how do you

1153
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
feel about the security posture his

1154
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,760
point is like andrew that's a bunch of

1155
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
 he's like the gap between what

1156
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,000
i'm doing now which is sms otp and what

1157
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
i get with passkey

1158
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
the the bar has risen so much from that

1159
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,599
right so maybe there's some use cases

1160
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,680
where like a high transaction or certain

1161
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,000
scenarios where i want to get added data

1162
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,760
or added bullet points in that case you

1163
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
know i could take capacity as just a

1164
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,800
single signal feed it into my risk

1165
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,240
engine and do other sorts of step up or

1166
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,480
other sorts of data to make sure that's

1167
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,880
a secure authentication but ultimately

1168
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
pasca raises the bar so high from the

1169
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,480
default means of authentication today

1170
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,079
that i don't think it's fair to say it's

1171
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,240
a weak security approach

1172
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,400
so i i have two

1173
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
i have two quick questions um

1174
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
i think a lot of people's concern when

1175
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
they're talking lower security is in

1176
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,480
comparison to what the 502 does right

1177
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
now which i i do prefer the 502 model i

1178
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,240
recognize the failings and like well now

1179
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,880
you've got to register on every site um

1180
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
but

1181
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,599
the quick question is

1182
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,200
one of the fundamentals of 502

1183
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,960
originally was the key existed on the

1184
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,640
device and it would never surrender it

1185
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,920
for any reason how do you know a key

1186
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,839
hasn't been cloned off like is it

1187
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,599
possible for a key to get cloned off

1188
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,920
maybe you authenticated it through some

1189
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,800
um

1190
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,000
you know you didn't realize what the

1191
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,839
page is showing you click something and

1192
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,280
then there's a clone out there that

1193
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,200
you're not aware of and that key is

1194
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
there is there any way to revoke

1195
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
credentials um

1196
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
so that's the first question i i mean i

1197
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,640
i'll let other folks also answer this i

1198
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,079
think that michael said that for them

1199
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,520
i'll just quickly mention that i mean

1200
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,839
remember um the qr code flow and all

1201
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,440
these things it's not actually your

1202
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,599
private key ever that goes over the only

1203
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,280
time that that will happen is when the

1204
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,079
user decides to sign in to an like to a

1205
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,000
new ios device to a new mac os device

1206
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,839
like in the apple ecosystem or to a new

1207
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,920
android device where where there is like

1208
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
okay maybe when you can kind of con

1209
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,599
drive this like this control deck where

1210
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,880
like you know the user thinks they're

1211
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
giving a google credential credentials

1212
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,240
to like a phishing site and then the bad

1213
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
guy runs an emulator at the back that

1214
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,880
looks like a real android device and

1215
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
they use that to pull the credentials

1216
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,359
down i mean we have a lot of um

1217
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,760
technology and signals around are we

1218
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,839
dealing with real legitimate devices or

1219
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,920
not so i think everything there feeds

1220
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,400
into our decision on whether or not we

1221
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,480
want to allow the credential syncing to

1222
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,880
come down to the device um if a user

1223
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,359
does let's say let's say i mean you

1224
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,359
convinced me on your android phone to

1225
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,359
type my credentials in there type my

1226
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,280
previous screen unlocking everything and

1227
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
now all my credentials are on that

1228
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,160
particular device let's say that's the

1229
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
attack that we're talking about right

1230
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,720
okay now my credentials are there i've

1231
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,119
got two options when i if i realize it i

1232
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,599
hope i do at some point um i can either

1233
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,920
go and i can go to you know settings and

1234
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
i can go and sign out that device which

1235
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,960
essentially then invalidates the pass

1236
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,400
keys like almost like a remote wipe

1237
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
right i can go do that or i can go to

1238
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,119
the various

1239
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,760
accounts for which i hold pass keys but

1240
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440
but this is the difference in let me

1241
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,119
kind of take an analogy right i lose my

1242
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,280
wallet can i call one number to just

1243
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,000
block okay sure can i can i can i block

1244
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,520
my entire wallet or do i have to call

1245
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
all five credit card companies do i have

1246
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,079
to call up all five credit card

1247
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,000
companies that's not great you have that

1248
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,520
option with passengers you can go to the

1249
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,359
sites and individually revoke the basket

1250
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,599
on that device but i would say mostly

1251
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,680
you would just go and like remove the

1252
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,040
account off the device which immediately

1253
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,480
wouldn't validate all the passwords so

1254
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,359
just to clarify on that um each

1255
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,359
each device has a unique credential that

1256
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,880
there's some mechanism that it

1257
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
authenticates with like it it's either a

1258
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,280
signing chain or are they all sharing it

1259
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
in the android world there is some

1260
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,119
uniqueness that can be used as part of

1261
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,160
the

1262
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,280
risk detection um not all platforms

1263
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,680
support that mechanism but there is

1264
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,839
something to die back onto there is

1265
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,599
caveats there but but there is a

1266
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,920
capability right but just just to answer

1267
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,280
more specifically if i have an android

1268
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,960
phone and an android tablet signed in

1269
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,480
the same google account it is the same

1270
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,319
credential on both devices okay so if i

1271
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,720
revoke it from tribank both of those

1272
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,640
devices lose access right okay just like

1273
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,560
a security key today and then the other

1274
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,720
question was because everything on like

1275
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
say a yubikey now is done

1276
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
locally and the way the mechanism works

1277
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,800
the low-level mechanism

1278
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,640
you can do two-factor authentication or

1279
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,040
even passwordless with um outlinking a

1280
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,480
lot of information on what sites you're

1281
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
doing stuff like that what type of like

1282
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,880
metadata analysis could google facebook

1283
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
or anyone in the phyto alliance be now

1284
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,880
open to

1285
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,800
because they're involved in the syncing

1286
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,079
process is it as limited as like there's

1287
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,599
no change right because the pass keys

1288
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,440
tied your account are intend encrypted

1289
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,940
right so there's no change in that model

1290
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,119
[Music]

1291
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560
so right now we're definitely encrypting

1292
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
all the private keys um to encrypt the

1293
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,760
metadata has issues regarding the way

1294
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
that we rendered it on the usability

1295
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,599
side so the mechanism that will work

1296
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,079
today metadata won't be encrypted but

1297
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,079
there is also no mining or anything of

1298
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,920
that but but technically that's

1299
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,520
something that we could add or that's

1300
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,720
something that if you choose to use a

1301
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,839
different provider in the future that

1302
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,920
they might provide for usability reasons

1303
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,119
we encrypt the private degrees and not

1304
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,960
the metadata today but that's something

1305
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,480
that there's for no reason other than

1306
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
just there's a usability constraint on

1307
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,400
that for us

1308
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,520
yeah i have a question regarding dual

1309
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,119
security keys

1310
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
uh i've implemented a couple of these

1311
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,200
bubbles and sites and tried to do the

1312
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,440
password

1313
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,560
okay

1314
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
hello okay eat the ac

1315
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,319
yeah much louder put it in my mouth

1316
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,520
yeah i

1317
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,319
developed a lot of this uh or i'm an

1318
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,160
early adopter and i tried to implement a

1319
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,839
lot of this

1320
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,800
what i felt lacking in the documentation

1321
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
or the implementation for before is like

1322
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,359
the

1323
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,560
support for dual security case so i want

1324
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,760
to have my computer that has a dpm and

1325
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,720
such

1326
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,560
and also my security key that is

1327
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,240
attached to my

1328
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,440
keychain

1329
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,200
to be able to do this

1330
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
yeah co-opted login

1331
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,560
how are your thoughts about that

1332
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,760
so

1333
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,960
just to make sure i understand the

1334
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,140
question like like dual security keys

1335
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,640
[Music]

1336
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
so being able to use or need to use both

1337
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,720
at the same time for an authentication i

1338
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
mean that's technically already possible

1339
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,240
it's like a relying party choice it's

1340
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,680
kind of like almost like a workflow

1341
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
where the relying party today can make

1342
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,000
the decision and saying hey i need my

1343
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
criteria as a password plus a security

1344
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,160
key or my criteria is a security key

1345
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
plus sms otp or my criteria as two

1346
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,839
security keys and that's something that

1347
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,000
is totally implementable uh from a

1348
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,520
workflow perspective on the relying

1349
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,040
party not something that the spec needs

1350
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,920
an easy change to teach you support

1351
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
uh yeah so my question kind of goes

1352
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,359
along with some of the questions that

1353
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,760
you had earlier and

1354
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,920
but my scenario is more of the sense of

1355
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
the user trying to recover

1356
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,400
their account when their devices lost

1357
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,960
stolen or no longer accessible

1358
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,040
they're traveling for business vacation

1359
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,400
whatever else

1360
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,680
they they have to resort to a machine at

1361
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,240
the hotel whatever to log in to

1362
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,760
access their information whether it's

1363
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,240
bank whatever else what is the user's

1364
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,000
option to be able to access our account

1365
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,560
when they don't have access to their uh

1366
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,000
devices that's already been in the

1367
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,160
ecosystem super tough question probably

1368
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,680
the toughest one that anyone is asked

1369
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,040
today right and that is that is

1370
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,400
ultimately like how do i know it's the

1371
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,160
right user and it's not someone

1372
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,240
pretending to be the user in this exact

1373
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,160
scenario right um

1374
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,040
the the easy answer today is going to be

1375
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,440
you're going to need to prove to us that

1376
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,560
like it's you through something

1377
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,280
you will you know if if there is no

1378
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,839
signal if it's not coming from a known

1379
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,920
ip address or like a location or

1380
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,839
something that we know about you which

1381
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,280
is you know got many different types of

1382
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,079
signals um you know if in the future the

1383
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,599
idea is that we remove passwords of

1384
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,800
google account so there will not be a

1385
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,240
password that will not be a signal that

1386
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,680
you can provide us anymore right because

1387
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,280
it's such a weak signal then the

1388
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,119
question is what can you provide us well

1389
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,560
maybe you can tell us about how you

1390
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,480
unlock your previous phone but then

1391
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,760
where are you going to tell that to us

1392
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,319
to the kiosk machine you know maybe

1393
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,920
that's okay but the question is also

1394
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,359
even if you can get into that kiosk

1395
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,880
machine we can't really make your pass

1396
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,800
keys usable from there because then that

1397
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,000
means they will be leaking onto the

1398
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,480
kiosk machine so it is a very this is a

1399
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,440
very tough problem um we're kicking the

1400
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,640
count down the road a little bit where

1401
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,079
we say well if you can at least get

1402
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,400
access to like another phone like a new

1403
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,480
one or someone else's you can sign in

1404
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
there like then then maybe you can sing

1405
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,319
things down but it's it's very hard

1406
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,319
because it's it's clearly a usability

1407
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,240
issue but it is also such a big security

1408
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,160
issue if we let the wrong user in or

1409
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,280
sync their credentials to a shared

1410
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,839
terminal then we don't have a perfect

1411
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,000
answer for that today but that is a

1412
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,960
problem that users are already

1413
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,200
experiencing right now but i think one

1414
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
potential thing right so let's assume

1415
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,240
that their phone got stolen but their

1416
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,079
laptop didn't we do have the ability to

1417
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,000
reverse that cross device flow it's just

1418
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,280
a little awkward right now turning your

1419
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,520
laptop to scan a qr code um that the

1420
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,880
protocol allows that right we just

1421
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,160
haven't enabled that experience so you

1422
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,839
could in theory use your laptop that

1423
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,119
didn't get stolen goes in your hotel

1424
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,319
room to get back into your google

1425
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,839
account by reversing the flow it's

1426
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:48,960
totally possible and apple's actually

1427
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,359
already supporting it for ipad and mac

1428
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,720
if you have nothing that we're stuck

1429
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,000
right

1430
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,200
you don't have access absolutely

1431
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,760
yeah hey uh yes

1432
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,599
thank you for your time by the way um

1433
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,599
how do you see uh

1434
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,839
onboarding working for first time log in

1435
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,520
like say you had no relationship to that

1436
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,680
tri bank no account no nothing no

1437
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,880
existing account how do you see that

1438
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,800
working and can you

1439
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,960
complete that workflow without ever ever

1440
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,480
making a password

1441
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
that that's the goal right i would say i

1442
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,160
hope in the next 12 to 18 months we'll

1443
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,680
start to see the first truly

1444
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,200
passwordless accounts with passkeys

1445
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,040
right the way we see this right you you

1446
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,319
still probably have to capture name and

1447
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,839
email address and phone number and then

1448
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,000
maybe when you hit submit it invokes web

1449
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,079
invokes the api creates a pass key and

1450
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,680
away you go you're on your way so the

1451
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,440
password field is gone you never capture

1452
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,280
it password and there are there are

1453
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,680
sites that already very small number but

1454
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,040
there are already sites that are doing

1455
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,240
that today but we hope the user

1456
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,079
experience will be much cleaner with us

1457
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,680
yeah and certain service providers are

1458
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,040
onboarding people without passwords

1459
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,560
today based on other

1460
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
proprietary data they might have like a

1461
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
telco for example has account

1462
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,079
information about them or other network

1463
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,640
api data they can use we're also inside

1464
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,720
the fido alliance we have we're doing

1465
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,480
some standardization work around

1466
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,800
identity proofing and verification

1467
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,400
which if we pull off which is you know

1468
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,480
very complex i think actually stands to

1469
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,400
have as much impact on the market and

1470
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,000
this whole problem as the authentication

1471
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,760
piece does but that's still pretty

1472
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,000
nascent um although we do have we'll

1473
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,400
have our first uh doc-off requirements

1474
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,480
document out in the next uh next couple

1475
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,720
months

1476
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,000
okay um

1477
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,520
it's it's really good to hear that

1478
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,319
you're taking on such a skilled uh

1479
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,520
usability uh team uh to work on your

1480
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,440
usability because my primary worry is

1481
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,079
and then i get divorced what happened i

1482
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,400
i managed to set up all my devices but

1483
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,880
all of a sudden i am now

1484
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,280
gonna untangle myself from the

1485
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,520
complexity that i've just made

1486
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,559
am i able to do i understand this or

1487
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,920
what if i die

1488
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,559
what happens

1489
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,880
that's a good one for you yeah christian

1490
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,440
but one well no tim

1491
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,520
oh just like fashion value right i mean

1492
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,720
yeah i mean there's well

1493
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,200
i'm not saying the problem is solved but

1494
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,960
it's very similar to what you already

1495
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,119
have with not a very good problem right

1496
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,559
yeah yeah i would agree with that that

1497
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,559
we're not we're not necessarily solving

1498
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,240
everything right these are not

1499
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,839
necessarily net new but that's part of

1500
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,760
iterating over time too right like we've

1501
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,800
already seen

1502
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,400
apple iterate on some of the digital

1503
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,000
legacy stuff that a lot that is thinking

1504
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,040
about that right so that's something we

1505
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,720
can enable over time as we start to

1506
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,680
think about what are the security

1507
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,280
implications of sharing a pass key right

1508
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,720
like all these different how do you pull

1509
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,720
that passkey back is it better you know

1510
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,640
one question we keep asking is it better

1511
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,880
for me to send you my pass key for my

1512
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,559
netflix account or just have you add a

1513
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,240
pass key to my netflix account right

1514
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,359
these are these are the things we're

1515
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,720
starting to think about all around

1516
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
revocability and all these models

1517
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,640
netflix says neither yeah well yeah

1518
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,800
terms of service official yeah yeah yeah

1519
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,640
yeah netflix i think is very happy about

1520
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
passkeys

1521
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,160
now they are yeah

1522
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,079
yeah i just i have basically the same

1523
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,680
question about shared devices it's a

1524
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
really common use case our customers are

1525
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,000
commonly coming to i work at slack and

1526
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
they they want the ability to have check

1527
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,359
out personnel use the same ipad

1528
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,760
and have a secure experience

1529
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,200
logging and logging out yeah so that

1530
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,040
that's actually so the one thing um you

1531
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,720
know christian's demo is really great

1532
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
showing the cross device flow where we

1533
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,480
step up and create you aposky on the

1534
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,240
local device the other flip side of that

1535
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,599
use case which we will heavily use in

1536
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,599
windows right the example i always use

1537
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,520
is a gate agent at the airport right you

1538
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,040
never want to create local pass keys on

1539
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,480
that terminal you always want to use the

1540
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,079
cross device flow so the shared device

1541
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,240
flow the shared device scenario is one

1542
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
where you will always want to use that

1543
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,079
cross device and never never even you

1544
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,040
may not even want to keep the

1545
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,400
relationship between that phone and that

1546
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,920
device it's completely ephemeral and in

1547
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,760
some cases maybe even a security key is

1548
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,119
better than a phone there like tap the

1549
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,559
security key it personalized and then

1550
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,160
when you remove it

1551
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,559
and those are great examples of you know

1552
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,400
you know the question we got uh i think

1553
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,599
last night at dinner was like well this

1554
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,359
is this is a consumer feature right and

1555
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,680
the answer is it's targeted at very

1556
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,760
consumer-centric use cases but if you

1557
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,839
look at a front-line worker in a retail

1558
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,839
environment uh you know i can tell you

1559
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,680
as azure ad identity provider they're

1560
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,680
using sms sign-in this is instantly

1561
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,880
better and those are quote-unquote

1562
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,720
enterprise scenarios right so the gate

1563
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,240
agent use case same thing like what is

1564
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,400
what is better than using a fishable

1565
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,760
mechanism or this phishing resistance

1566
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,440
thing that may or may not be on their

1567
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,880
personal phone or a managed device it's

1568
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,640
still better and in a better user

1569
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,839
experience less efficient yeah we

1570
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:24,960
shouldn't rule out passkey for the

1571
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,760
enterprise what's the azure date like 28

1572
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,559
of

1573
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,480
your clients for using mfa yeah so we

1574
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,000
can move that up you know 10 20 percent

1575
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,079
by using pass keys that's that's a great

1576
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,160
thing and christian alluded to right we

1577
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,760
are we have added to the to the

1578
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,760
specifications options for enterprises

1579
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,200
or i hate the term enterprise work

1580
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
school higher security you could argue

1581
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,800
that like a twitter verified user is

1582
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,240
closer to an enterprise user than a

1583
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,319
consumer that's one example so where uh

1584
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,000
you know there are there are mechanisms

1585
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,839
in the spec to to accommodate those that

1586
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,000
you'll start to see uh it

1587
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,079
so we are we're getting close to time i

1588
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,319
have to end this and there will also be

1589
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,960
a one hour break before we continue but

1590
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,760
again uh this one's for you first andrew

1591
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,000
um

1592
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,760
privacy in this i mean security is one

1593
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,359
thing privacy is

1594
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,520
part of security it is also something

1595
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,559
different

1596
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,440
so

1597
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,920
have you looked into if this

1598
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,880
pass keys fido web off and youtube or

1599
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,880
whatever you want to call it

1600
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,240
you should really look into

1601
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,280
standardizing stuff yeah

1602
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,760
on the privacy part of things have you

1603
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,800
looked into whether this technology will

1604
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,440
improve privacy or if it also introduces

1605
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,480
new

1606
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,000
privacy

1607
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,160
difficulties for people in any way

1608
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,800
whatsoever like my friend cecilia asking

1609
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,760
well what about when i got get divorced

1610
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,720
is it suddenly harder to maintain good

1611
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
privacy as an example yeah that's a

1612
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,240
great question and this is the type of

1613
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,520
discussion we're having inside of fido

1614
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,800
alliance today so i'm not going to give

1615
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,640
you a really square answer on that we

1616
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,920
have a security and privacy working

1617
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,680
group that's looking at these issues

1618
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,720
coming up with the best kind of a

1619
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,720
canonical approach if you will for how

1620
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,880
one should implement pesky to

1621
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,880
um to adhere to fido's privacy

1622
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
principles that we've had since day one

1623
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,079
yep and so i think there's certainly

1624
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,440
already implications there's there's so

1625
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,359
there's that conversation happening the

1626
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,119
other thing we do as a body actively is

1627
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,920
we engage with regulators um

1628
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
across the world to understand how you

1629
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,400
know phytoauthentication in our various

1630
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,440
forms

1631
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,520
fits in with current and emerging

1632
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,640
privacy and regulatory policies so i

1633
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,400
mean like any new technology that we

1634
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,079
introduce in alliance or elsewhere that

1635
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,480
impact user authentication

1636
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,680
we look at it closely inside the

1637
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,440
alliance and figure out you know how

1638
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,480
fido's

1639
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,720
best practices and specifications can

1640
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
meet you know the privacy needs

1641
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,200
so yeah one one thing that i'll and i'll

1642
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,559
speak specifically for microsoft on this

1643
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,720
um one thing that has come up in the

1644
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,640
past few months for us is thinking about

1645
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,960
how easy it is for users to use consumer

1646
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,839
federated sign-in right passkey has the

1647
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,920
opportunity to remove

1648
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,760
the need to do consumer federated

1649
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,119
signing which has serious privacy

1650
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,880
implications right you're telling that

1651
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,160
identity provider everywhere you're

1652
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,079
signing in now on the enterprise side

1653
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,280
that's what people pay for right you're

1654
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,640
paying for federation you're paying to

1655
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,000
track employees because you need to

1656
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,839
enforce policy the consumer side they're

1657
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,599
doing it because it's easy so it's back

1658
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,520
to whoever asks the sign up flow if that

1659
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,319
sign up flow is as frictionless as as

1660
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,240
clicking sign in with x that i won't

1661
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,000
name

1662
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,160
i'm just kidding yeah i know we have it

1663
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,599
too technically no one uses it but um no

1664
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,880
no so if we can make that as

1665
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,520
frictionless as possible um then you

1666
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,760
could make the argument that consumer

1667
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,839
federation with these big big identity

1668
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,480
providers could and maybe should go down

1669
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,160
significantly over time i'll say one

1670
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,440
thing for 30 seconds this is the other

1671
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,599
point right i think a lot of the a lot

1672
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,079
of the questions around like i mean

1673
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,400
there is a whole

1674
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,559
you know slew of use cases which i won't

1675
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,000
even go into because they're all super

1676
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,880
depressing but around you know whether

1677
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,119
or not users should get access and what

1678
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,960
happens when folks break up and like

1679
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,720
there's this whole and i think a lot of

1680
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,400
that isn't so much the protocol it's

1681
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,440
around the implementation of the

1682
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,040
protocol and that's good and bad because

1683
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,319
that means hey the protocol is done but

1684
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,920
that also means the relying parties need

1685
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,520
to take ownership of those experiences

1686
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,040
themselves i know we're having

1687
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,640
discussions at google around like what

1688
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,559
does it mean to give someone access to

1689
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,559
you you know and rather than typing a

1690
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,240
google account password now you can just

1691
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,680
use the screen lock on the device what

1692
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,160
if that's a you know a spouse's device

1693
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,839
what if that's the shared kids tablet

1694
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,440
like how do i revoke that and i think

1695
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,720
we're trying to think through those and

1696
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,040
implement uh you know particular

1697
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,760
workflows but the the downside is that

1698
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,440
means every single relying party need to

1699
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,599
do the same thing and and i think that

1700
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,680
can be tricky and i think we're gonna

1701
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,359
you know folks will get it wrong like i

1702
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,280
think you know we're better like

1703
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,359
but but i think we are absolutely trying

1704
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,960
to think through those use cases because

1705
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,680
we do realize that they are important

1706
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,480
and and use cases on this i i think that

1707
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,119
well i i know that

1708
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,520
cecilia myself we will most definitely

1709
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,559
be looking into the abusability aspects

1710
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,200
of this absolutely for the for the next

1711
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,880
weeks and months and years as well we

1712
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,640
are really interested in this stuff so

1713
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,480
it's interesting um we're getting very

1714
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,400
very close um

1715
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,640
i want the sales pitch

1716
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,760
for this

1717
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,319
because i'm based on me saying

1718
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,559
there is no risk analysis and there is

1719
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,240
no business case

1720
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,680
justifying the removal of passwords so

1721
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,760
try me yeah give me this sentence i'm

1722
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,119
going to give you a hot date

1723
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,559
tell me i'm wrong i'm going to give you

1724
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,559
a hot take one

1725
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,799
how much is your sms cost your sms

1726
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,640
service how much do you pay per year i

1727
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,000
can tell you

1728
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,440
i'm not going to tell you what microsoft

1729
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,720
is

1730
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,480
we're talking millions of dollars across

1731
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,400
these companies for even just an sms

1732
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,559
based signup right that's

1733
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,000
not the primary reason but that's a hot

1734
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,839
take that often has come up in

1735
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,440
discussions is what do these other

1736
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,880
methods actually cost that are

1737
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,640
completely unnecessary if the primary

1738
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,599
factor is phishing resistant

1739
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,000
christian sales pitch i mean

1740
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,839
i i haven't prepared this one but i

1741
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,160
guess my talking points here would be

1742
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,319
something along the lines of if you're

1743
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,160
not removing the password

1744
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,599
and you're making the password safer

1745
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,520
you're adding something adding something

1746
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,200
comes at the

1747
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,960
like you're immediately the moment

1748
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,559
you're adding you're you're you're

1749
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,400
taking you know you're making usability

1750
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,640
worse like that is just insecurity like

1751
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,839
whether there's something additive

1752
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,240
security is being made worse the only

1753
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,839
way where we can make usability better

1754
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,599
or keep it on par

1755
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,559
while adding the security protection is

1756
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,240
taking something away and what is the

1757
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,760
thing we can take away it's certainly

1758
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,559
not fido it must be i mean ergo it must

1759
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,079
be the password like that that is my

1760
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,119
argument here to make

1761
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,240
i we need to talk more afterwards okay

1762
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,400
well uh that's it for for this

1763
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,480
discussion i'm really really incredibly

1764
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,119
