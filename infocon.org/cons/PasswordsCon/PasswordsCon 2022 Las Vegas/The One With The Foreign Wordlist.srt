1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
um

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,560
sort of a background for this talk is

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,080
that

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
i think i believe

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,080
that when we are discussing passwords we

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,240
are giving our password advice

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,679
when we are talking about password

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,640
cracking which we love to do

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
we are most of the time focusing on

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
english names and words

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,359
a vast majority of all research is

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
heavily

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
towards english

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,200
even me with

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
norwegian being my native language

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,879
there is a lot less research

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
about that

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,120
we had an excellent talk several years

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
ago in stockholm from somebody living in

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
south africa

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
talking about

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,000
exactly that

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
he said that if you know swahili as an

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
example and you can do a very simple

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,280
password in swahili

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,760
chances are pretty small that the bad

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
guys will be able to crack it because

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
they just don't have a word list in

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
swahili available

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
and today i'm really happy to have back

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,840
again dimitri from south africa and his

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
colleague ethan

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
that will be talking about the one with

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
the foreign word list

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
and i'm not going to say that's a

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040
continuation of that previous talk but

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,159
again research into passwords and

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
passphrases that are not necessarily

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
strictly english or using standard

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,119
english alphabet

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,640
so please take it away

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,119
thank you bear and thanks thanks

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,320
everyone for attending today

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,200
just

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
some background on us so i'm dmitry

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
forsekis i'm the chief technology

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,880
officer at

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
bcs group

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
which also owns

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,479
a company called bit crack cyber

51
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
security

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,880
um we're based in south africa and we

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
operate throughout africa

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
handling cyber security pen testing

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
assessments advisory

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,319
password auditing and so forth so

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,440
ethan

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
is one of my colleagues he's a security

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
consultant from the company so we'll

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,959
both be presenting this part today

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,720
as per mentioned we have done i've done

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
some talks before on passwords having

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
efficient password lists

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,319
but what we wanted to do was look for

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
new and different ways that people are

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
creating their passwords especially now

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
and especially since that talk was given

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
i think you said seven or eight years

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
ago i can't remember how long ago it was

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
we've also changed a lot of the dynamics

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
around how we enter passwords now a lot

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
of it is more done on a mobile device

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
than it is for example on a keyboard in

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,160
front of

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
a computer which is why we're also going

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
to touch on a few things

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,239
related to entering passwords on a

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,640
mobile device

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
but when it comes to foreign word lists

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,879
what we wanted to touch on was what

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
makes an efficient

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
word list right

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
very briefly i'm not going to go into

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
too much detail on that but it's the

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
reason for why also we want to discuss

86
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
foreign word lists

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
by my english is when we will now start

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
looking at the foreign word list

89
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,200
the one with the emojis so coming to the

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
cell phones again

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
generating passwords on on cell phones

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
is very common these days

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
which means we have a keyboard that can

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,360
also do

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,959
emojis now

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,920
and that also creates some complexity

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
some websites

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
will die a horrible death if you try and

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
use emojis but some will not so if those

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
passwords are leaked and there's

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,120
password hashes up for being cracked

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
emojis could be in there

103
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,400
and then putting it all together we'll

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,080
just show you some brief tools that we

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
created to help you do that they'll be

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,879
on github shortly after the talk

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,400
and we hope that you'll extend them and

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
work with them and get them to do more

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,239
and then of course

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
the mandatory cat picture for pear i

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
hope you'll i hope you like it

112
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,439
good so we can now begin

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,680
okay so what makes

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,918
an efficient word list and as i said

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,120
we're going to spend too much time on

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
this but i wanted to highlight

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,880
actually the opposite what's not

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,120
efficient and why we thus want to have

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
these targeted wordless

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
so big wordless

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
they're not efficient right

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
especially if you've got slow passwords

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
that you want to crack if you've got a

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
25 gig word list

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
and you've got a ton of gpus and you're

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,360
cracking md5 that's great you'll you'll

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,479
get through them

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
switch to assaulted hash switch to

129
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
bcrypt something like that

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
and your great grandchildren will still

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
be watching the job running

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
so we want to create efficient wordless

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
especially ones in foreign languages

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
what about numbers in wordless we want

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
to leave these out as well the reason

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,560
i'm mentioning numbers is because

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,400
they'll come up in the

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
emoji side as well we generally don't

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,960
want numbers and word lists because

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
brute force rules can generate those

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
very quickly we can append them to words

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
or stick them anywhere in a wordless

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
candidate so there's no point to really

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
having

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
numbers in our word lists

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
except maybe when we're dealing with

147
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
emojis and you'll see why when ethan

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
does his part there may be a good point

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,240
to having

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,800
your rules output some words with emojis

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
and the golden wordless rule that i've

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
stressed before all those many years ago

153
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
if a rule can do it your wordless

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
shouldn't have it okay because

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
if your word list has all the things

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
your rules could do instead of using the

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,199
computational power of your gpu you're

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,720
just using text files and hard disk io

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
and it's pointless because you're

160
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
shoving those planes into gpus

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
and you're just doing a glorified

162
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,680
comparison rather than getting work done

163
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
on the process of a gpu so

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
try and keep the word list as simple as

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
possible let rules do all the work

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,520
that needs to be done on that

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
so for the first part the first

168
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,560
technique we're going to look at to

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
today is something called

170
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,319
translation

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,199
when it comes to foreign word lists now

172
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
i don't know if any of you have had

173
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,400
experience with chancellor alliteration

174
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
if you've ever had to translate into

175
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
other languages

176
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
you may have come across transliteration

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
what is it

178
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,639
so according to the dictionary it's

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
defined as representing or spelling in

180
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,080
the characters of another alphabet right

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,639
so it's not translation

182
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
it's transliteration

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
but it can happen after translation okay

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
so if i've got a word in one language

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
i translate it to another language right

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
and that language could be say it is

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
russian or arabic or greek or something

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,560
without a standard

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
latin character set

190
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
that's all good and well and we can find

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,720
many dictionaries on the internet

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
with russian words with

193
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
um greek words without with arabic words

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
but what most people do

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
is that they're sitting in front of a

196
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
keyboard that's got latin characters or

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,319
english if you want to call it there but

198
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
let's call it by the proper name which

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
is latin character so what did they do

200
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
they think of the word in their in their

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
home language

202
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
but they type it out the way it sounds

203
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,599
on the keyboard that's transliteration

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,840
so let's look at an

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
example if we take the word alphabet

206
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,280
okay

207
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,120
that's what the translation to alphabet

208
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,720
is in russian

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,599
okay

210
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
now a russian person entering a password

211
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,240
on a website may think to themselves

212
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,039
well

213
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
let me take this word and rather type it

214
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
as it sounds

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
and so i'm not going to enter the

216
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,599
russian

217
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
character so we could have a dictionary

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
with a lot of russian words in it some

219
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,960
nice unicode there you could brute force

220
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
if you're using hashgate or john unicode

221
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
characters yes you might come past this

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
word at some point

223
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
but there's a good chance and we see

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
that a lot in the passwords we crack

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,479
that the person didn't actually type it

226
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,280
in

227
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
that character set

228
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
what they did in fact was

229
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,360
they used transliteration which is here

230
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
on our next slide

231
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,000
okay

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
so they took how the word would sound in

233
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,639
their language and they wrote it out in

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,120
latin characters and then they add all

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
the bells and whistles to it so we can

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
have

237
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
adding of numbers we can have special

238
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
characters we can have

239
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,479
case sensitive toggling uh we can add

240
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
special characters to it we can do quite

241
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
a lot right now if you were only working

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,760
off of english this word wouldn't come

243
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,799
past

244
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
in your dictionary right because it's

245
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
not an english word its base started off

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,959
in russian

247
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,480
and we

248
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
see it sounds like the word alphabet and

249
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
excuse my russian pronunciation but

250
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,399
i'm dmitry the greek version not the

251
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
russian one so my russian's not good

252
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,839
and alphavit could have been written

253
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,360
like that and thus we would have missed

254
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
it in our in our dictionaries if we were

255
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
trying to crack these passwords

256
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,279
even if you were brute forcing okay

257
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
we're not assuming that was the password

258
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
we're assuming it's going to be a

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
complex one and something that's got to

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
go through rules to actually be

261
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
effective

262
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
so

263
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
how do we generate these words okay

264
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,680
because we could do it

265
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,880
manually

266
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
by manually i mean you go take russian

267
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,760
word

268
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
what is the what does it sound like how

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
is it pronounced okay let me write that

270
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,720
in in latin characters all right like

271
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
brute forcing b crypt with a large word

272
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
list your grand great grandchildren will

273
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
be doing that work as well

274
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
what about dictionary mappings

275
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
not exactly easy because it's long and

276
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
it's hard and the other thing is it may

277
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
not understand the pronunciation of the

278
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
word

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
to actually give you

280
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
an answer right so when i'm saying that

281
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,880
word in another language like arabic

282
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,480
greek russian

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,279
or chinese how does it sound and how do

284
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
i get that into english or non-uh

285
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
standard characters back into the latin

286
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,360
characters

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
so we leveraged a service and both

288
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
google and microsoft offer the service

289
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
the microsoft one just is a lot easier

290
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,079
to use it's called microsoft's azure

291
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,920
cognitive services and

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
it's actually not designed for this it's

293
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
designed for all the fancy things like

294
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
uh auto completion of words on your apps

295
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,120
translation

296
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,880
translating sentences and keeping the

297
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
right intent in it

298
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
but one of the features it does have in

299
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,079
the future that we're using is

300
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,760
transliteration

301
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
where it can take

302
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,839
a language like a russian word or a

303
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,120
sentence

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,839
give you the translation of that into

305
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,279
how it sounds

306
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,640
and then give you the english

307
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,680
translation sorry the latin characters

308
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
translation for that

309
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
so if we come back to this slide

310
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
right that word running through

311
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
microsoft's

312
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,560
cognitive services came out with that

313
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
okay now something else to keep in mind

314
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,440
is that these characters might not

315
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
always be what a person will use what do

316
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
i mean

317
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,800
what do i mean by that right maybe some

318
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
of you can pick pick it up but

319
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,320
if i'm a russian person and i'm

320
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
pronouncing alphavit and i'm not using

321
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,959
an english or a latin keyboard to type

322
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,480
alphabet

323
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
i might not use an i i might use a y

324
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
so it might be a l f a v y t okay

325
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,720
we'll touch on that just now because

326
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
that means some rules are required in

327
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,959
these word lists to get them to be even

328
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,880
more effective than just dumping out a

329
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,640
bunch of words and using them

330
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,040
so azure cognitive services

331
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,760
just a warning about this okay like any

332
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
service out there especially when you

333
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,560
spin up your aws machines and you do

334
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
something and you forget about it and

335
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
then you have to sell your house

336
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,240
something similar might happen here okay

337
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
there's a free tier

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
in in azure where one million characters

339
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
can be transliterated for free

340
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
after that you need to use a paid

341
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,279
service and that's going to bill you per

342
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
character

343
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
so if you take the the tool as it is and

344
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
you shove a

345
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
25 gig word list in it

346
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
well it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna be

347
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
a bit expensive what did you find out

348
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,940
yeah the hard way

349
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,760
[Laughter]

350
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
okay so it's going to get expensive what

351
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
we've done and i'll get that on to the

352
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
next slide for you

353
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
we've done some things to help you out

354
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
and we'll continue putting them on our

355
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,040
git

356
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
as we go forward

357
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
but what i want to show you quickly

358
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
if i can just escape from here

359
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
is

360
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
coming to our console here

361
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
okay

362
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
okay i'm just going to show you the code

363
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
here it's very easy to use to go forward

364
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
so what you do is

365
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
you come to the bottom you'll get

366
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,240
yourself a

367
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
and a subscription from microsoft's

368
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
cognitive services

369
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
it'll spin up an end point for you that

370
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
that you can use

371
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,240
you simply add your location

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
uh you add the endpoint using the

373
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
translate endpoint this code will be

374
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,800
online you can take it and work with it

375
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
and then you go from from there and when

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,519
we get to looking at the tools i'll show

377
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
you what the output

378
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,519
for that is

379
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,519
now what we did is we took the english

380
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,200
dictionary

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
and we shoved it through the service

382
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,560
okay

383
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,360
and

384
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,240
it's a two-stage process but thankfully

385
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
microsoft cognitive services returns

386
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
both in the same reply

387
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
so we took english

388
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,160
we said take the english dictionary and

389
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
convert it to russian

390
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,880
right

391
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,760
then

392
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
how would that russian be pronounced

393
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
give us the transliteration in latin

394
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
characters and that's when you get

395
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,880
output like this now okay

396
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
so it's the english dictionary and it's

397
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,839
obviously the end of it i'm not showing

398
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,199
you the whole thing

399
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
it's the english dictionary and we've

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
translated it and at the same time taken

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the pronunciation and transliterated

402
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
that

403
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
and now we have a whole bunch of nice

404
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
bass words to use

405
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
when we're cracking our

406
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,560
past passwords

407
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,279
to help you we've done three languages

408
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
through the engine i'll put those on

409
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,800
github for you you can use them as base

410
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,760
words

411
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
and you can extend it further um

412
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
obviously like i mentioned be careful

413
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,160
because once you pass the free tier

414
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,959
your

415
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,240
credit card's going to start being built

416
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
for the output coming coming out out of

417
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
this

418
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
it's not overly expensive i'm just

419
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,399
saying just keep an eye on what you're

420
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,279
doing

421
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,880
and the reason i mentioned rules are so

422
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,000
important is

423
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,480
never ever give this

424
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
your dictionary with

425
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,519
a whole bunch of junk in it right

426
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,880
because if you give azure airplane one

427
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,320
two three

428
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,079
azure is gonna say well this looks like

429
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,600
a spelling mistake i'm sure you meant

430
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,639
airplane

431
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,440
right

432
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,959
i say you've got a thousand of those

433
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,399
you've actually paid to translate the

434
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,560
same word a thousand times because a

435
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
zero is going to either give an error or

436
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
it's going to say i think you meant this

437
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
and it's going to give you the word so

438
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
you actually do duplicating work so make

439
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
sure the input dictionaries

440
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
into the cognitive services when you use

441
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
these tools

442
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,800
are very based dictionaries they have

443
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,880
nothing extra added to them so that it

444
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
can just give you the raw output of what

445
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,320
it sounds like when translated in to

446
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,639
english

447
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
after that there's some rules you you

448
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
can consider like i mentioned and we'll

449
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,040
put these up on the github as well

450
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
okay because

451
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
people are not microsoft's cognitive

452
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
services right they think differently

453
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
they get into habits

454
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,839
so someone who is russian maybe and

455
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,800
typing

456
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
these words on on an english keyboard

457
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,000
the way they sound

458
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
may not use an i where it should be they

459
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,519
used a y instead

460
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,079
maybe they didn't use a k they use the c

461
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,360
instead so

462
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
now you don't want wordless with this

463
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,240
because like i mentioned you want your

464
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,160
word list to remain efficient

465
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
and fast

466
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
but you want rules to plug into your

467
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,560
password cracking offload at your gpu

468
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,959
let it do all the hard work here of

469
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
figuring out all these iterations of

470
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,959
what the person could have typed

471
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,040
while they were busy with it

472
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
in case you forgot what you don't know

473
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
okay this this is a standard hashcat

474
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,399
rule the s means replace x with y so

475
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,759
replace a y with an i replace an i with

476
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,519
a with a y replacing c with a k i'm sure

477
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,079
you get the drift you can build on these

478
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,560
we have done quite a lot of this so i'll

479
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
publish those on git for you as well

480
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
what we've done in the various languages

481
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
is we've looked at what people could

482
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,360
have used right so for example greek

483
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,399
if you're translating the word greek

484
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
say drink in greek is

485
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,399
right so potter could be p-o-t-o when

486
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,679
written on a latin keyboard

487
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
but greeks have the omicron and the

488
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,959
omega

489
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,520
which looks like a w so the person could

490
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
maybe have used the w instead of an o

491
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
but the cognitive engine won't know that

492
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,679
it'll give you p-o-t-o as the output and

493
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,160
so these rules will then come in handy

494
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,240
to fix those minor things where just

495
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,599
human

496
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,520
humans have changed it by using a

497
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,960
character that could have been some

498
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,520
something else

499
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
so that covered the first technique the

500
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
second technique we're going to look at

501
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
is keyboard walks

502
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,240
with a difference when it comes to

503
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
foreign languages

504
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,640
and this is an interesting one because i

505
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
didn't realize how often it actually

506
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
gets used

507
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
but it's used quite a lot not really on

508
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
on cell phones and tablets

509
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,400
but certainly on computer keyboards

510
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,280
and keyboards where people type

511
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
okay a normal keyboard walk this is not

512
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,240
what we're talking about right i'm sure

513
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
those of you in the know will know what

514
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
a keyboard walk is you have a pattern

515
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,160
you don't know the the password you know

516
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,240
the pattern on the keyboard right so i

517
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
go

518
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
and a password comes out of it okay

519
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
and these various tools that can do that

520
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
hash cat's got a few

521
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
others have a few

522
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
right

523
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,640
not complex

524
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
there are many ways to do that

525
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
but how does it tie into foreign

526
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,919
wordless right if the

527
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
person's used that

528
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
well we're going to look at a keyboard

529
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
now it's called the

530
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
perma keyboard it's a chinese keyboard

531
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
one of the many

532
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
chinese keyboards out there they're

533
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
simplified ones there's there's uh

534
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
non-simplified ones there's a whole lot

535
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
of different ones

536
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,679
but what we're going to do now is we're

537
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,679
going to look at a keyboard walk based

538
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,919
on the assumption that

539
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,640
two things have happened

540
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
either the person

541
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
typed the word in chinese

542
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,960
but left the keyboard set in english

543
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,799
or type the word in english and left the

544
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
keyboard set in chinese

545
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,200
right so what happens then is

546
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,120
i'm thinking of the word

547
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
password right so

548
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,039
i'm a chinese person i speak english and

549
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,120
speak chinese and i think let me type

550
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,640
password in

551
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
but i'm going to be

552
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
clever as it were and what i'm going to

553
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,400
do is i'm not going to leave the

554
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,679
keyboard in english i'm going to set the

555
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
keyboard to chinese and then type the

556
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
word past password now if we do that and

557
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
we press a p and an a and an s and an s

558
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
and a w and o and r d

559
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,080
that's what comes out in characters

560
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,400
okay it means nothing

561
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
you can't translate it it's not a word

562
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,160
right it looks pretty random and if you

563
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,480
came that across that in in the past in

564
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
a hashes you were trying to crack you

565
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
may look at it and think but we're not

566
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
trying to translate it it's not working

567
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,919
that's because the original word was

568
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,960
actually thought of in a different

569
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,039
language but it was typed on a

570
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
multi-language keyboard with it set in

571
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
the other language

572
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
so the person hit the right keys but the

573
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,440
keyboard entered what each

574
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,240
one of it in its chinese simplified is

575
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
and that's what came out as characters

576
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
and then they might add their fancy

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
things like a few exclamation marks and

578
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
or well

579
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,919
we knew we know users it's not

580
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
complicated chances are it was at august

581
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,919
22 or something but

582
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,760
the fact is that

583
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
this is pretty random from our point of

584
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
view and the opposite could be true

585
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
right the person could have thought of

586
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,120
the word in chinese

587
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,880
but typed it on this keyboard set to

588
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
english in which case it'll look like

589
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
gibberish to you but there's actually

590
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,640
words

591
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
so what we've done is we built a tool

592
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
that will also be on on github

593
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
and it's it's going to take a few of

594
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
these keyboards and say okay give me the

595
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
input language

596
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
and i'll show you what

597
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,360
what would have been output if the

598
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
person entered it in that language but

599
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
set the keyboard to its actual language

600
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
or the other way around and so you would

601
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,360
get nice wordless

602
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
filled with these

603
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
random characters as it were even though

604
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,760
they're not actually random random

605
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
characters

606
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,880
so those were the two techniques i've

607
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,760
covered

608
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
for you now

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
the transliteration

610
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
which is how does it sound in that

611
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
language but i'm typing it in latin

612
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
characters right

613
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,159
very common so when i crack some hashes

614
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,799
using those base words it does crack a

615
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,720
few of the open stuff that you can find

616
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
lying around

617
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,559
on the internet remember to think about

618
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,799
your about the target right

619
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,679
so

620
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,600
if it's a russian website where you've

621
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,679
got hashes that that you're

622
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
legally obtained and you're and you're

623
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,080
trying to crack them okay

624
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,360
you're not going to use chinese

625
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
transliteration as much as you are going

626
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,799
to use russian

627
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
you could you can if you want to but i'm

628
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
saying give it some thought as well when

629
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,640
you're working out that and then on on

630
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,159
the keyboard things to think about your

631
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,760
targets as well because

632
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
it could be that it's an arabic keyboard

633
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
right but the person thought in english

634
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,360
but typed it in arabic mode on the

635
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
keyboard and so we've got a bunch of

636
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
arabic gibberish which is actually makes

637
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,679
sense if you look at what was timed when

638
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,760
they walked the keyboard

639
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,679
so up next we're going to introduce

640
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,640
ethan

641
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,320
and he's going to take us through the

642
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,840
one with the emojis

643
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,960
[Music]

644
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
the one with the emojis

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
so why do we need to account for emojis

646
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,640
in our password lists

647
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
well for starters there's increasing

648
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
support for it

649
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
we on our mobile phones we've had emojis

650
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
for ages

651
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,840
and you see now in windows 11 they've

652
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,480
just released an emoji keyboard max also

653
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,799
had it for a while so a lot of devices

654
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,000
have support

655
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
for emojis

656
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
so it's no longer the case where you'd

657
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
maybe make a password on your phone

658
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,840
and then when you get your desktop it

659
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,440
wouldn't work because there's no emoji

660
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
support there

661
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,039
also our heavy use of our mobile phones

662
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,960
everyone has a mobile phone and using

663
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
emojis has become part of our lives

664
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,640
we use it in our text messages

665
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
it's really become part of our language

666
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
so it's only natural

667
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,679
that it also become part of our

668
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,559
passwords as well

669
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,720
again a lot of accounts are

670
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,960
only used on our mobile devices

671
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
if we think about things like instagram

672
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
tick tock uber they're all accounts that

673
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
we only use on our mobile devices where

674
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,720
we have emojis

675
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,240
and then there are a lot of emojis over

676
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,720
3600 emojis in unicode standard

677
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
so this is a very very large character

678
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,559
set that we need to take account in of

679
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,840
when we do our passwords

680
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,200
perfect

681
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
so what does our tool do

682
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,120
while our tool works on the assumption

683
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
that people would use emojis in phrases

684
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,440
in their passwords

685
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
you can generate a random list of the

686
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
most frequently used emojis and use that

687
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,760
to try crack some passwords but what our

688
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,000
tool does is it will take a phrase for

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
example

690
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,360
i love my dog hashcat

691
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
and then the plaintext password of that

692
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
could be i love my dog hashcat 2022

693
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
all together without spaces and then the

694
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
emoji fired password of that would be i

695
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
beating hearts my dog emoji

696
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,320
hash emoji etc etc

697
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
there were a couple challenges that we

698
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,360
faced

699
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,520
when making this tool first off there's

700
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
a lot of emojis

701
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
for example the word love could have

702
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,480
well over 20 different emojis

703
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,440
related to that specific word could have

704
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,760
the heart emoji the blue hoten heart

705
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,880
emoji

706
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
heart eyes kissy face all those

707
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
different ones could portray the word

708
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
love and same with things like dog

709
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,039
so what we had to do is generate

710
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
all those different combinations and

711
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
someone might have only used one emoji

712
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
in their password they might have used

713
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
two they could have used three et cetera

714
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
et cetera so with this tool we really

715
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
try to generate

716
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,159
all the different possible

717
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,720
uh emojis with this

718
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,120
or passwords with this well that does

719
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,559
mean that you're gonna end up with a

720
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,159
word list that's quite big if you don't

721
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,799
have a really specific input file with

722
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,799
just a couple words or phrases

723
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
another challenge was the different skin

724
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,039
tones

725
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,320
if we think about just the thumbs up

726
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,840
emoji or good emoji there are five

727
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,600
different other skin tones and we need

728
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,880
to take accounts of that as well

729
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,760
and

730
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,440
how it works with

731
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,640
emojis and and things like skin color or

732
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,600
color

733
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
is there's actually two different

734
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
unicode characters

735
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
we have one unicode character for the

736
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,279
thumbs up

737
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,120
and then the next unicode character for

738
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
the color brown and combine they

739
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,919
generate the brown thumbs up emoji so we

740
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,799
also

741
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,559
generated that in our tool

742
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,400
tool inputs so our tool can take in a

743
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
variety of inputs

744
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
you can take in something like a book or

745
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
a wikipedia page about someone

746
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,000
some sort of article and we're also

747
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,960
using

748
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
engrams

749
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
to to do this and what an engram is is

750
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
collection of n number of words or

751
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,200
sample text with

752
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,880
with the highest probability of what the

753
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,760
word will be next so for example i've

754
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,919
got the wikipedia page of formula one

755
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,000
driver max verstappen

756
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,320
and in there we can see that after the

757
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
word max the most common word that would

758
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
come after that would be verstappen

759
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,279
and then when he was born born 30

760
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,080
september and so on and so forth so you

761
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
could feed it anything from a book or

762
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
wikipedia page and generate

763
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,600
passwords like that

764
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
another thing you can take in is just a

765
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,720
text file of passwords so you might have

766
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
in your password list something like i

767
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
love my dog hashcat

768
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
2022 you would have to have the

769
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,799
numerical value in there

770
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,720
otherwise it won't get transferred into

771
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,799
emoji and then although we'll just split

772
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,120
that up into the different words in

773
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,000
there so i love my dog

774
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and then i'll change all the

775
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,360
those words into emojis

776
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,679
so options for the tool obviously just

777
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,679
the infile option the file you want to

778
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
take as input for it art file

779
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
spaces you can choose if you want to

780
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,440
have spaces in between the words or if

781
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
you're just like them all stuck together

782
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,440
numbers if you'd only like to emojify

783
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,279
the numbers in your

784
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,840
in your password you can also choose to

785
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
do that

786
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
sub char substitutes all available

787
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,080
characters instead of just the words

788
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,679
so for a password like fox moon 19

789
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,720
there's uh emoji for the character for

790
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,919
the letter

791
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
o for x for m

792
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,600
and what they'll do is they'll just

793
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,720
generate

794
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
fox moon with all those characters being

795
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
emojis and also generates all the

796
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
different

797
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,159
combinations

798
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,000
of that

799
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,360
dashing this is for if you're using

800
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,559
engrams

801
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,559
for something like a book or an article

802
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,080
and then dashing is just the number of

803
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,000
engrams the depth that you that you want

804
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
to go to

805
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
so just for a quick demonstration

806
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,200
escape

807
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,520
okay cool

808
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,080
so just go to our tool python.name

809
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,840
you can have our input file

810
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,679
i think it's just

811
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,640
yeah and then our odd file

812
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,360
okay

813
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,679
so this would just do

814
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,159
change every of all of the words

815
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
in that text file into an emoji so for

816
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,120
just examples we can look at what our

817
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,439
input was

818
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,799
all right

819
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
sorry

820
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,279
apologies is very difficult to see up

821
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,279
here

822
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,799
so that would just be our example uh

823
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,559
file i'm a fan of the radar chili

824
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,720
peppers i'll put that in there

825
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,840
and then the outputs

826
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,240
did you see our outfall

827
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,960
so there would be our output file

828
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
of all the different emojis and all the

829
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
different

830
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,200
combinations

831
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,840
where's it gone

832
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
of all the different combinations of

833
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,279
that word and

834
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,919
i can't do it

835
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,080
and they'll go through all the different

836
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,960
combinations of that just

837
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,159
with the emojis in there

838
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,480
cool

839
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,039
handing back to dimitri

840
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,920
[Music]

841
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,600
okay

842
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,840
just so you can see it a bit but

843
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,679
clearest okay so if you go back to the

844
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,519
beginning

845
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,120
okay so that's what it

846
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,320
took with red hot chili peppers okay so

847
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,080
obviously it's going to iterate as ethan

848
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,279
mentioned

849
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,559
through the different options of what

850
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,679
could be

851
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
red hot right um

852
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,559
okay

853
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,600
that's the mask okay as we go down we

854
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,440
get to the next one

855
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,440
okay

856
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,360
so

857
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,039
as ethan mentioned it can get complex

858
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,840
with emojis because

859
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,799
different

860
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,240
people use emojis to mean different

861
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
things right okay like when i'm

862
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,279
when i when i'm happy i might use an

863
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
emoji with a smiley face someone else

864
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,000
may think thumbs up means i'm okay so

865
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,399
i'm happy so we have to iterate a lot

866
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
based on intent as well which does

867
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,120
create make the file bigger but

868
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
depending on what hash you've got

869
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,279
it can get through them quite fast

870
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,080
you can also use std art

871
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,600
on the tool and

872
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,679
and pipe it straight into hashcat so you

873
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,600
don't even have to generate the uh wait

874
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,799
for the word list to generate either

875
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,720
i'm just going to exit this quickly

876
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,200
okay so if we come back to our um

877
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,559
slides where we were

878
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,279
okay so putting it all together

879
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,640
so we've had a look at the one of with

880
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
the emojis

881
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,880
we've had a look at the keyboard walks

882
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,919
so looking at transliteration

883
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,760
right

884
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,840
if i have a file let's call it

885
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,200
test1.txt okay

886
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,039
and we put some words in there base

887
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,720
words that we want in our dictionary so

888
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,200
let's take

889
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,519
airplane

890
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,000
let's take potato

891
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,600
uh someone give me some words

892
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,000
nouns

893
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
garden

894
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,720
gar

895
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,200
garden

896
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,000
good okay

897
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,840
so what we'll do then is um

898
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,279
we will call our tool

899
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,960
right

900
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
and we're going to say that the in file

901
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,000
is test one

902
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,159
okay we give it an art file test1.out

903
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,800
okay and then we give it the language

904
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,960
so what i want to do is i want to make

905
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,159
this let's take arabic right ar

906
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,679
so i'm asking

907
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,839
the cognitive translator translated to

908
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,119
arabic

909
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,879
how does it sound if i speak it in

910
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,520
arabic and give me that in latin

911
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,199
characters and hopefully if

912
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,320
it works

913
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,679
we should get some output here

914
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,918
okay so there we have some upward i'm

915
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,000
not sure if it's big enough to see okay

916
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
so what it did did is it translated

917
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,040
aeroplane

918
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,320
to tyra

919
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,679
i'm not my

920
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,119
arabic is also not good right so if i'm

921
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,399
pronouncing it wrong

922
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,599
forgive me but

923
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
so it took the word translated it out

924
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,440
and then gave you what it what it would

925
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
it would sound like

926
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,520
again the tool will be on github and you

927
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,440
know take it and change it make it

928
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
better get it for what you want it to do

929
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,000
there's no threading for example the

930
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,280
reason i didn't put threading in is

931
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,480
because

932
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,160
i was worried that might burn my credit

933
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,000
card even more than

934
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
than it has already but um

935
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
yeah so just just be careful because if

936
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,720
it goes wide

937
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
microsoft's going to be smiling at you

938
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,560
with the amount of of or what you're

939
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
doing but like i mentioned we will over

940
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,240
time be translating

941
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,200
based

942
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,359
dictionaries for you into these

943
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,480
uh so just

944
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
visit the github page every so often

945
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,920
um

946
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
which like if i go back to here

947
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,240
um

948
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,079
so it's it's not there yet don't visit

949
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,640
it yet we haven't copied the stuff over

950
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,280
but uh from this evening or tomorrow if

951
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
you visit it i will

952
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,280
tweet it out as well

953
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,800
you can then visit it and we'll start

954
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,079
putting this stuff up there and you're

955
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,119
welcome to fork all the tools and create

956
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,280
your own change them as you want to and

957
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
do that so

958
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
that's how we covered foreign word lists

959
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
i'd like to thank everyone

960
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,800
also uh some of the stuff we've done is

961
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,200
not has been studied before

962
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,800
we're just changing the way we're

963
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
adapting it so we've got

964
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
some people to thank for research and

965
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
stuff that they've done

966
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,359
as well

967
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,359
um

968

the word ninja emoji translate the

969
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,920
natural language toolkit hash cat of

970
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,119
course

971
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,040
um

972
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,880
those people whose names i don't want to

973
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,480
destroy

974
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,680
and then uh yeah for microsoft azure

975
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,839
cognitive services i'm i'm thanking them

976
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,640
for taking my money thank you very much

977

but the service is good and and it works

978
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,119
well like i mentioned there is a

979
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,040
google one as well if you want to play

980
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,400
with that one we're not using it in our

981
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
tool but you can also play with

982
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,720
the google one as well give it a try see

983
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
what it's like

984
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,079
and you can build off that

985
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,700
thank you very much

986
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,240
[Applause]

987
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,359
for dimitri and ethan

988
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,599
sure while they're asking i'll put it

989
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,359
back up

990
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,440
i have a question uh in my language we

991
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,560
have a

992
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
danish character called

993
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
and if you try to write that in english

994
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,160
often danish people will type o and e

995
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,200
so

996
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,359
do you take that into consideration that

997
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,960
one character could become more

998
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
characters

999
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,720
yes so what we're doing

1000
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,480
uh i'll quickly come here to this one

1001
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,440
okay it will fall under here

1002
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,320
um with rules okay we didn't do danish

1003
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
rules but thanks for the info we'll

1004
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,960
we'll add those as well you know

1005
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
you you can also yeah i mean there's

1006
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,200
nothing to stop you doing it in fact

1007
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
it's better if the person who speaks the

1008
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
language does it because you know

1009
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,720
like i know in greek what we often

1010
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,560
transliterate to right i might not know

1011
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,720
in in danish so

1012
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
but do it under rules so that you don't

1013
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
have to cater for it in all your word

1014
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
list output

1015
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,720
someone wanted

1016
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,359
this one i think

1017
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,599
just going to add the twitter account as

1018
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,280
well while you're asking questions so

1019
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,839
that we can also

1020
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
i have a question for you uh yeah can

1021
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
you say anything about any success rates

1022
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,720
you've had with this i mean

1023
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,560
the tool is awesome the concept is

1024
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
awesome but

1025
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,599
have you been able to crack like one

1026
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,000
more hash or are we talking

1027
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,839
uh what are we talking about how you

1028
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,240
know how much have you improved your

1029
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,640
uh password cracking capability with

1030
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,839
this so we did crack a few hashes on

1031
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,040
some

1032
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,200
publicly available lists

1033
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,359
um we didn't try to target them

1034
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,040
specifically so we didn't actually

1035
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,000
create

1036
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,520
the word list we created were more for

1037
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,079
the talk than for actual wordless

1038
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,160
targeted lists out there

1039
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,960
we tried them on a few from

1040
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
the hash killer website

1041
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,839
but but again it's too vast to actually

1042
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,920
know what they they what they could have

1043
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,720
been

1044
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,119
they were uncracked hashes that

1045
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,040
some of the password crackers have tried

1046
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,200
and didn't get and a few cracked out of

1047
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,560
that

1048
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,640
we i would see it working a lot better

1049
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,960
is in a corporate environment so

1050
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
if you get ntlm hashes

1051
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,040
especially in in corporate environments

1052
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,800
where they've got the multiple keyboards

1053
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,079
pretty sure you'll see quite a bit of

1054
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,280
that

1055
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
and you'll see it if you can get a hold

1056
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,880
of hashes well

1057
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,720
maybe add the disclaimer if you can

1058
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,880
legally get hold of hashes from

1059
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,359
websites with mobile registration you'll

1060
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,240
come across a lot of emojis on there

1061
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,680
like ethan mentioned although the

1062
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
keyboards are available in windows and

1063
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,079
mac i don't think the uptake is as high

1064
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,520
as when they're creating them on the

1065
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,760
mobile devices

1066
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
your example of the keyboard works uh

1067
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,480
walks is something that i actually saw

1068
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,720
when i was tracking passwords illegally

1069
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,000
in ukraine like 15 years ago so people

1070
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
were doing that back then they thought

1071
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,480
of something in russian or ukraine and

1072
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,160
they sort of looked at the achilles

1073
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
characters but they actually typed in

1074
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,000
what became english characters into the

1075
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,720
system and to me was complete nonsense

1076
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
until i realized what they were actually

1077
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,839
doing

1078
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,078
more questions

1079
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,760
i i think there's a question probably

1080
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
more for ethan

1081
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,560
some of the

1082
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,680
conversions to emojis that you had ended

1083
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,920
up being very short like i love my dog

1084
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,760
could be i heart dog

1085
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,720
do you have and i'm wondering if uh

1086
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,520
websites and so forth are

1087
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
uh counting the minimum

1088
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,119
password length wrong you know you'd if

1089
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,200
it's supposed to be eight characters do

1090
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,119
they are they counting

1091
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,200
you know each emoji is like

1092
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
four or something like that because

1093
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,440
that's that's its length in unicode uh

1094
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
it well it depends so a lot of the

1095
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,599
emojis are just a single character a

1096
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,839
single unicode character but then again

1097
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,359
some of them with like different colors

1098
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,319
and stuff it's two it's two characters

1099
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,000
right you'll see it as two characters

1100
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,599
but but even the emojis that are a

1101
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,119
single character

1102
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,280
it takes multiple bytes to represent

1103
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,079
that so it might be a four byte long

1104
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,480
unicode character to represent that

1105
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,040
emoji yes but it will still be only seen

1106
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
as one character

1107
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
okay yeah i i

1108
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
hope hoping that they're seeing it as

1109
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,560
one rather than four otherwise you're

1110
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
going to get some really

1111
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,640
probably easy to crack two character uh

1112
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,480
passwords yes

1113
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,480
cool

1114
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,000
sorry just to add to that so what i

1115
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,079
think a lot of websites are doing as

1116
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,119
well

1117
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,280
is that they're taking the input if it's

1118
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,560
unicode

1119
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,960
um they're then catering for okay it's

1120
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,359
unicode so don't look at the actual

1121
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,520
unique code itself but

1122
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,359
work out what how many characters i've

1123
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,760
i've i've got in unicode rather than how

1124
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,640
many plain text with the actual unicode

1125
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,440
written out as u1 or whatever the heck's

1126
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,960
value is

1127
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,359
for that

1128
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,640
okay so thank you again dmitry and ethan

1129
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,720
great talk

1130
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,480
now there will be a break until five

1131
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,480
o'clock uh some changes are coming

1132
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,319
jeremy gosney

1133
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,240
couldn't come and he had to cancel his

1134
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,359
talk

1135
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,440
and magic happened

1136
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,480
so he is now at a hotel

1137
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,520
and hopefully he will do his talk

1138
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,960
passwords but make it uh nihilism at

1139
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,839
five o'clock i will gladly skip my talk

1140
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:36,560
for

1141
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,359
listening to him so i really hope that

1142
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,119
you will be back at five o'clock and i

1143
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,599
will go look for jeremy right now thank

1144
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,839
you
