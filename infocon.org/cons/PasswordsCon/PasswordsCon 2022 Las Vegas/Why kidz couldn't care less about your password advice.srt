good

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
so my name is mia hacker grill lansam

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
so no it's not hacker girl

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,280
it's grill as in a hot grill

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
because my gaming name was gamer grill

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,240
which is a term used for a hot girl

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
gamer and i was like 15.

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,360
so i changed it to hacky grill cause i

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
don't even have a hacker name yet so i

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
just did it i am a pen tester though i

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
and i'm probably one of the youngest

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
speakers maybe

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800

i couldn't bring her to school

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080

171
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
and

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
i see that kids mostly ask on instagram

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
and snapchat if they need my help and

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,520
then we have the dinosaurs

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,759
they're coming to this um

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
to this website sending me emails and my

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
facebook page

178
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
most kids these days they have a pretty

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,039
empty facebook profile if you seen it

180
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
and then you have all the dinosaurs who

181
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,319
love writing about what they had for

182
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639
dinner and breakfast on facebook every

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
single day

184
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,800
yeah

185
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,440
there's a lot of cool stuff to social

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,360
media and internet as well that's why

187
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
we're here right we work with cyber or

188
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,120
you're interested in cyber because it's

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,759
so cool but there are some bad sites and

190
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,759
i'm not gonna talk about all of them

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
because it's a lot

192
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,479
but

193
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,039
three out of four 19 years old reports

194
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,720
that they have blocked someone on social

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
media

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
seven out of ten said they have added a

197
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,639
stranger on social media

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,680
26

199
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
reports that they have been bullied

200
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,520
online in 2020

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
and some say they have received threats

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
online

203
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
and when i speak to parents i do educate

204
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
parents in schools all over norway

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,759
they say that they're afraid of their

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
kids being bullied that they will have

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,599
their nudes leaked

208
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,599
um that there's dangerous people who

209
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,720
likes children pedophiles

210
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
and abuse

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
but no one is mentioning hackers loss of

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,639
passwords or other personal uh

213
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,280
information

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
so how can we protect them then

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
do you guys recognize this guy on the

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
screen

217
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
oh he's sitting right there

218
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,479
so authenticating

219
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,879
that's a hard word to say

220
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
i just used to say like login or

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
whatever

222
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
and on most social media apps we need to

223
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
authenticate you guys have a username

224
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,519
you have an email you have a password

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,360
children does that too

226
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
and as pair says here children also has

227
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
to authenticate on social media gaming

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
platforms

229
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
shocking

230
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,279
that says the dinosaur pair too same

231
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
so even dinosaurs knows that children

232
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,800
also has to authenticate

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
they face the same cyber threats every

234
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,480
day just as we do

235
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
even at school they need to authenticate

236
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
to use stuff and gaming

237
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
and we do say

238
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
never share your password with anyone

239
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
not even your best friend

240
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
okay

241
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,000
but 24

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
of these children have shared their

243
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
password with someone

244
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,240
and here you have these um dinosaurs

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
telling the children don't don't ever

246
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
share this

247
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,240
but they do see where you write down

248
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
your password under the socks in your

249
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
closet because you walk there every time

250
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
because you always forget your passwords

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,290
that's how i hacked my dad

252
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,600
[Laughter]

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
sorry dad if you're watching

254
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
and

255
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
29

256
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
says that they know their parents

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
password on app store or google play

258
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
so never share your password with anyone

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
but here is my password

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
there is parental controls so you don't

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
need to give them the passwords

262
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,320
it's just a google search away really

263
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
and it's kind of lame if your kid spends

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
thousands of dollars on minecraft

265
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
try to get that back on the insurance

266
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,839
i was told not to drink tequila by my

267
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,720
mom it was a bad idea she said did i do

268
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
it

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
yes i did

270
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
did it end well

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
no

272
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
it didn't

273
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
did you you see that's what happens and

274
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
did i do it again

275
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,880
yeah

276
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
my mom told me not to steal cookies i

277
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
stole them

278
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,000
and i counted the cookies

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
we will always do what our parents tells

280
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
us not to do

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
but that doesn't mean we should not not

282
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
to that doesn't mean that we don't say

283
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
don't do this and that because we need

284
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,079
to tell them like the rules and how they

285
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,719
need to behave

286
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,040
but why do they share their password

287
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
even though you say

288
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
nah

289
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,959
so norwegian numbers from 2020

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,160
31 of those who shared a password that's

291
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
because they needed help with something

292
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
21

293
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
in case they would forget

294
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
seven percent to prove that i am a good

295
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,880
friend

296
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,360
and 59 percent

297
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
who shared a password shared it to help

298
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,040
out with snapchat streaks

299
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
yeah

300
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
so snapchat streaks is a bigger deal

301
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
than you might guess

302
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,800
how it works

303
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,959
after three days of snapping you get

304
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
these very cool flames we like flames

305
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,680
you know and it will start to count the

306
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,360
days that you guys have been snapping

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
each other

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
so after three days you get a flame

309
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
super cool and you want that to go high

310
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
high high but if you don't snap them for

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
about 24 hours

312
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,880
then the hourglass comes

313
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,639
it's saying that if you don't snap them

314
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,399
really soon you're gonna lose your

315
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
streak and you have to start all over

316
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
again

317
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
no

318
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
that's like losing your world of

319
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
warcraft account after 10 years and you

320
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
have to start leveling up again yes i

321
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,519
did that that was horrible

322
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,040
i broke up with my boyfriend but we kept

323
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
a streak for a few more weeks but once

324
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
he broke the streak i knew it was

325
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
officially over

326
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,519
that day was so sad

327
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,600
it can really hurt when a streak ends

328
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
some of my friends get offended if i

329
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
break a streak and others don't care as

330
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,399
much it all depends on the person

331
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
my parents took my phone away one time

332
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
and i gave my friend my login to my

333
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,360
snapchat so she could keep up my streaks

334
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
i was panicked about losing them all

335
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
because i couldn't get to my phone for

336
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
two days while i was grounded

337
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
numbers from my cafe

338
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,920
so this is actually my longest trick all

339
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,440
my other streaks are like 10 days

340
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
this is magnus and hi magnus if you're

341
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,079
watching

342
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,079
378 days

343
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
that's a long time i think

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
me and magnus we don't really hang out

345
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,279
that much

346
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,040
we actually don't really snap each other

347
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,600
either we used to for a while and we

348
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
won't work in it we work a lot we're not

349
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
that much on snapchat really so now for

350
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,040
like 100 days the only things i get from

351
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,480
him is streak streak streak

352
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
once a day to not break the streak

353
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
and this comes from a person who thinks

354
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,639
the streaks is stupid but i do i can't

355
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,000
feel what these children are telling

356
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,079
because if you have a streak over 300

357
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,440
days

358
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
you know you want to continue if you win

359
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
at gambling

360
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,600
you you take 1 000 you get 10 000 back

361
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
of course you want to gamble more

362
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
and also i remember when i had a

363
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
boyfriend and the streak was gone that

364
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,600
reminded me

365
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,920
this is the first time in one year that

366
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
we have not spoken for a day

367
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,160
and that is pretty sad actually

368
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,480
so what can we do about this

369
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
we need to be a god influence or a good

370
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,959
role models ourselves

371
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,519
so dear dino make sure you know what the

372
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,320
kids do but also yourself like saying

373
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
not share your password don't don't

374
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
bully people but then you're in the

375
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,839
facebook comments calling all the girls

376
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,880
fat or are saying that's stupid i had

377
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
salmon for lunch today because you don't

378
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,959
care about the news

379
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,800
children they do

380
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,360
learn this stuff from somewhere

381
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
school needs to implement better first

382
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
passwords

383
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,839
so some school still uses the last name

384
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,480
and the yearborn of their students i

385
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,399
remember mine quite well lam me 97 i'm

386
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,600
born in 97 last name is lansam

387
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
do you think i guessed the password to

388
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
the other students hell yeah i did

389
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,199
did i do something bad yes i did and i'm

390
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,079
sorry if you're watching

391
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
they also

392
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
use um easily guest passwords

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
and i want them to use some sort of

394
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,720
password managers or to step security

395
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
there's a million functions to these

396
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
password managers

397
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
and that's a million functions also that

398
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
is never even used

399
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,920
does the password manager people

400
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
check what their users are actually

401
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
using or not why do we need all these

402
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
functions what do i click what is a

403
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
vault what is this i don't know even i

404
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,959
i'm even confused

405
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,040
can we just make it really really really

406
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,279
easy so hey there password manager

407
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,959
people make easy ones for kids

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,079
and not so expensive ones to the school

409
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,360
because not our schools actually have

410
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
the money to use stuff like this and

411
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
that's why they have 80 people creating

412
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
la min 97

413
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
why do they share password with someone

414
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,839
else to get help

415
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,680
it's very embarrassing to ask your

416
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,440
parents for help

417
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,600
even i am like now if i need to ask my

418
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
mom how to like wash my clothing or

419
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
something i like um mom what do i do

420
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,759
with this shirt again

421
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,920
they think that the parents know nothing

422
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
about security

423
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
and computers

424
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
even if you work in i.t

425
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
doesn't mean that they will ask you

426
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
because they're maybe

427
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,800
even afraid that you will make them feel

428
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
stupid

429
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
or that you talk too much

430
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,880
or you're talking to dinosaur or too

431
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,959
nerdy for them to even understand

432
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,240
if they won't come to you for help

433
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,320
make sure they know where to get help

434
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,120
look at the other dinosaurs around them

435
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,040
you have the t-rex you have all these

436
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,240
other dinosaurs around them

437
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
talk to them and make sure they know you

438
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
can contact this t-rex instead of me if

439
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
you want to

440
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,240
it's important that they know where to

441
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,079
ask for help if this happens where do

442
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,280
they go

443
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
you are not their only

444
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,479
dinosaur in their lives

445
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
and also

446
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,599
why does kids not know about two-step

447
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
authentication

448
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,319
so maybe someone here noticed how i

449
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,119
wrote two-step altercation

450
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,319
but more up here i did two-step security

451
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,280
whoops

452
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
or maybe not

453
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,200
why is these words not standardized

454
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
on behalf of all young people

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,559
and all dinosaurs

456
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,400
please standardize it

457
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,720
it's stupid we have like 10 different

458
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
names for the same thing

459
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,760
and everyone is fighting now we need to

460
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
use this

461
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
it's nothing to fight about

462
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,760
the children especially the children

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,320
they don't understand this word what kid

464
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
uses the word authenticate

465
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
what do they say when they log into

466
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,880
their favorite game

467
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
i'm authenticating myself into fortnite

468
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,919
no they're saying i'm logging in now you

469
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,120
guys

470
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
we're gonna win this

471
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,559
they're logging in

472
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,200
logging on

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
it's stupid for everyone to have

474
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,080
different ways to do it and

475
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
like apps or sms or maybe email how to

476
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
set it up it's stupid standardize it

477
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,520
don't fight about it just agree

478
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
so i will say two-step security because

479
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,120
it's easy to recognize

480
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,320
two steps okay there's two steps

481
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,679
not two-factor two-step security maybe

482
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,080
two-step login security easy for

483
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
everyone to understand

484
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
so

485
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,080
also children they're pretty lazy now

486
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
they're really smart they can even hack

487
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
their parents

488
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,960
but they're just used to getting all the

489
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,600
answers they're not googling anymore

490
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
they don't know how to use google they

491
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,360
don't know how to find this information

492
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,039
themselves because they just watch

493
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
youtube and tick tock all day

494
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,640
we need to make sure that we just don't

495
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
give them the answers

496
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
some people some kids that are like 14

497
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
and they have all these social media ask

498
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
me what is two-step security

499
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
google it

500
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,559
don't just ask me find the information

501
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,360
yourself as well

502
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,640
understand what is important to these

503
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
children and why because when i speak

504
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,640
about snapchat streak me and you here

505
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,799
you're laughing

506
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,720
but for children it's actually more

507
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
important to have a snapchat streak with

508
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
their friends and loved ones than

509
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
being

510
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,600
safe they know it's bad to give away the

511
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
passwords they know it's bad they know

512
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
they're told not to but friendship and

513
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,480
love

514
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
beats that common sense

515
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,880
losing a snapchat streak may cause drama

516
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
fights lots of friends lots of status

517
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,559
and it's a way to prove who is the best

518
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,159
of friends and that's really important

519
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,799
to these children

520
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,039
i think that snapchat

521
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,240
should make two-step security a must

522
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,480
if you are going to have the opportunity

523
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
to have streaks

524
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
because they know that 59 of these

525
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,200
children giving out their passwords it's

526
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,840
for snapchat streak and snapchat streak

527
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,159
only

528
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,480
then they should make it a must

529
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
of course they can let them even with

530
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,760
the two-step security as well but not if

531
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
the parents took away their phone and

532
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,919
they're grounded then they can't because

533
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,480
they are just giving out the password if

534
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
they're gonna give them the two-step

535
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
security as well

536
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
it's not gonna work

537
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,679
and also they need to stop and think one

538
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,200
more time

539
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
children especially one young ones they

540
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,159
can't really stop and think too and two

541
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,360
three times

542
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,280
it doesn't work that way

543
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
and also i don't like children using

544
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
money but me you have kids here they use

545
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
all the money and on the minecraft and

546
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,440
fortnite all the skins and all of that

547
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
so maybe snapchat could have like a

548
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,039
packet that you can buy

549
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,480
if you're going away you're losing your

550
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,919
phone whatever

551
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,840
pay a dollar and you won't lose your

552
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
streak for five days

553
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
it's easy money for them it's not too

554
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
expensive

555
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
and it shouldn't take much time to get

556
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
that

557
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
also maybe parents can try to understand

558
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
how important the streaks are

559
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,559
you're taking away their phone which is

560
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
a punishment i do not support at all

561
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,240
because it just means they're scared to

562
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,120
do

563
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,360
a stupid [ __ ] because they're gonna lose

564
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
their games and friends

565
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,799
that's horrible

566
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,240
they should know that if they did

567
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,919
something bad

568
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,120
then you should have a talk with them

569
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
don't just take their phone

570
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
tell them and show them

571
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
why was this comment you said on

572
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
someone's picture wrong

573
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,919
you don't have to take away anything and

574
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
if you do

575
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,120
snapchat streak

576
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
let them log in once a day and fix the

577
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,799
streak i'd rather do that which i think

578
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,480
is stupid

579
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
and not necessary at all but it's not

580
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
stupid for them

581
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
gaming

582
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
i believe that a lot of ik people

583
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
they're into i.t because of gaming

584
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
me myself

585
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,120
i was on a gaming team i also my first

586
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,240
time on television was in 2014

587
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
it was this mia with this light very

588
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
very light voice

589
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,679
and i was speaking about gaming and

590
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
being a full-time athlete trying to

591
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,240
reach the olympics

592
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,039
and 86 percent of those aged 9-18 they

593
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,120
do play games online

594
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
and i loved games if it wasn't for

595
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,520
gaming i wouldn't be in las vegas today

596
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
good reaction skills skills they can use

597
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
in other activities i was a full-time

598
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
athlete doing good in school and

599
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,559
balancing all this stuff talking and tv

600
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,919
shows about gamers about this issue

601
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,120
they also feel that they're learning

602
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
english better

603
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
and most games they do need a password

604
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,240
kids they contact me or their parents

605
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,679
because they're getting hacked on their

606
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,200
favorite game

607
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,720
and when you spend like thousands

608
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
dollars

609
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
that's not fun at all

610
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,080
it's a lot of accounts that they maybe

611
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,159
spend years on leveling up or spend a

612
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,440
lot of money on

613
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
and they're really really sad

614
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
someone in the game tricked them and

615
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
said if you give me your password i i

616
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
can show you this cool skin

617
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
so where did i learn about security it's

618
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,360
gaming i built my first computer when i

619
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,039
was 15

620
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
just because i needed to play better i

621
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,919
needed better fps i didn't want it to

622
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,960
lag

623
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
i wanted a nice gaming computer i didn't

624
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,240
care about forensics hacking or whatever

625
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,279
i just wanted to play my games

626
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
the password they use

627
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
so the problem is they have now of

628
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
course because people like ped and says

629
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
that you need different passwords for

630
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,039
applications so if you get hacked on one

631
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,559
of them you won't get hacked on the

632
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,919
other ones

633
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,960
that's great and i agree

634
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
the problem is children need to make

635
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,799
multiple passwords

636
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,559
they also need to keep

637
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,120
to keep track of passwords safely

638
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,559
and they also have to think about the

639
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,960
strength of their passwords

640
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
we're talking about children who still

641
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
likes barbie and plays fortnite and they

642
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,159
need to think about grown-up stuff

643
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,880
the first very passwords are received by

644
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
parents or at school

645
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
and i remember this

646
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
very well because the passwords are

647
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,919
mostly related to their lives

648
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,799
sports gaming animals names numbers

649
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,120
colors

650
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,000
if you go to like um password leaks

651
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
and you search for my old email you're

652
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,120
gonna see football 1997

653
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,279
mia

654
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,840
0904

655
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
my birthday and when i needed a longer

656
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,919
password because that's that was the

657
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,440
thing you know you need a long ass

658
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,559
password

659
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,480
mia

660
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,720
0904 0904

661
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,559
and then when you need special things i

662
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,799
just did the same and then

663
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,520
some kind of march

664
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,279
i stopped using those password when i

665
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,880
was 16.

666
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,240
it's just

667
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,039
luck that i was never hacked

668
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
16 that's like that's nine years ago

669
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
dangerous i never thought about that

670
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
before i was into gaming because i

671
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,679
didn't want to lose my account

672
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,840
younger kids they do rely on family

673
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,720
support for password maintenance

674
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
that's from nist

675
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
and

676
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,159
my parents never helped me with that

677
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,000
they didn't know things about passwords

678
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
i knew their password sorry mom

679
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,200
um i could figure it out all the time

680
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
bad habits they're learning best

681
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,679
practices at school

682
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,840
and by parents or other relatives but

683
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,880
they have bad habits

684
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
they reuse the passwords and they share

685
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
step as well with friends does it seem

686
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,159
familiar to what grownups is doing too

687
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,320
so when the grown-ups are giving the app

688
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,279
store passwords to the children

689
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
do you think maybe they're reusing it to

690
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,159
their facebook and stuff as well

691
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,640
i think so

692
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
oh here we also have another word you

693
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159

694
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,159
another word for the same thing

695
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,200
so this is epic games and they

696
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120

697
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,360

705
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
authentication

706
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,559
they're even better than the biggest

707
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,120
companies are helping the children with

708
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
their security

709
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,679
snapchat and other platforms where you

710
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,200
know there's children there and they're

711
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,440
here to stay they should also offer the

712
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
same stuff they should offer them

713
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
something on this fortnight or the other

714
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
games you will get this cool skin

715
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,240
and what does kids use money for skins

716
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,200
weapons on the cs they use it to get

717
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,320
these things in the games

718
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
we need to give them a cookie when they

719
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,159
do something good

720
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,480
my dog i learned i taught her how to sit

721
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,960
by giving her treats

722
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,840
we're run by rewards as humans as well

723
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,919
we are scared of

724
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,480
of uh police officers but when you don't

725
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,399
see them you're gonna speed anyway with

726
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,360
your car

727
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
but when you see the photo box and oh no

728
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,039
there's a camera i'm gonna follow the

729
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,320
law now we're so scared of punishment

730
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,559
and we care about rewards that's how the

731
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,039
world works children they're like that

732
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,880
to give them a cookie and they will wash

733
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,559
wash your whole house

734
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,279
at least i would

735
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,520
other platforms love for the same they

736
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,679
should talk it's not my job they should

737
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,360
talk and like how can we offer these

738
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
kids something that will make them use

739
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,559
this security stuff

740
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,799
we need to realize that children are

741
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,679
here to stay and the bad habits

742
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,399
that they have as children

743
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,760
that will follow them for the rest of

744
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,000
their lives

745
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240

749
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,960
long time

750

that one kid that maybe gets her

758
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,600

759
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,799

image abuse because there's a lot of

773
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,840
things that can happen if you share your

774
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
password with your friend and now they

775
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,320

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,799
that you have and not tell you anything

778

but just stop taking these nude photos

801
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,840

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
they are created

833
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,880
websites that are made to only harass

834

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,320
super cool and you want to trade them

842
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
and that's how this let's go to the

843
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
industry works as well

844
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
anyone got any pics of her

845
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
do you have this do you have that let's

846
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
trade

847
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,399
category a i call this me as abc it's

848
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
really simple i like simple things

849
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
because if not i'm not gonna remember

850
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,240
them

851
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,080
abc category a is what i say when i mean

852
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,559
where these abusers

853
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,600
gather

854
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,880
where they try to arrange trades um ask

855
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,519
for pictures and so on and of course

856
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,000
they know that now the police is

857
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
actually doing something

858
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
and you have this super super um

859
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,640
scary feminists like me alonso

860
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
who will come and catch you

861
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
and make you go to prison

862
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,360
so now they have to like authenticate or

863
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,000
they have to prove who they are and who

864
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,360
they are not

865
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
so you gather here you say yeah i want

866
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,399
to trade okay but you need to prove to

867
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,880
me that you are not the police

868
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,720
so they go to category b which is the

869
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,559
place where you

870
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,799
kind of authenticate where you identify

871
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,720
yourself and you prove yourself

872
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,799
that works this way you have it's

873
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,519
usually a file dropping service like

874
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,360
dropbox um

875
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
google disk

876
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,080
all of this stuff vola file mega share

877
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,919
and there's a set of rules don't be a

878
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,519
dick to anyone

879
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,159
nice to have rules and you have to

880
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
send a photo of someone you have to

881
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
publish it in that file

882
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,159
a folder

883
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,960
and then add the name of the picture as

884
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
your name that you will be added on

885
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,480
later

886
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
so you're gonna publish a picture and

887
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
then within 24 hours you get access to

888
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,480
category c which is the holy grail for

889
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
abusers douchebags and

890
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,240

891
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,399
you might see here discord it's one of

892
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,560
the most used applications for this

893
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,199
third step

894
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,359
you see a channel you create groups you

895
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,119

896
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,879
whatever you want you can make it open

897
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,239

898
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,119

lowest age in these groups on discord

909
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,440
and other platforms

910
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,680
it's videos and pictures of children

people ask me why i want to do this

914
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,119
stuff and it's not that i want to do it

915
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,160
but it's because i speak to children

understand

924
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,880
that they need to take their security

925
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,040
a step up

926
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
two-factor authentication all of this

927
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,880

woman in the itc community in norway

934
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,200

absolutely love it

941
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,680
they should and they should be scared

942
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,480
because i talk to children at the age of

943
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,960
16 who is forced to have sex with their

944
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,400
abuser to not get their pictures leaked

945
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,280
i talk to children at the age of 17

946
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
where the sex video stayed somewhere and

947
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,960
someone hacked their account found it on

948
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,599
snapchat memories cause it's cloud-based

949
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,800
and now they're saying give me a

950
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
thousand dollars or i will post it on

951
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,560
your story to everyone you know

952
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
i help and speak to parents of children

953
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,079
at the age of 15 who is no longer a lie

954
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,320
because someone decided to blackmail

955
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,839
them and post their videos online

956
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,160
they're dead

957
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,240
and it's really sad

958
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,480
children they're on social media

959
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
it's the same cyber threats

960
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,400
we need to understand and talk to them

961
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,720
about what is important to them

962
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,960
companies who are supposed to keep us

963
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,680
all safe and create solutions good stuff

964
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,160
for us they need to create more simple

965
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,240
solutions especially for the young ones

966
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,839
and also the elderly people

967
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,240
we need to standardize and simplify

968
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,640
password managers and password or

969
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,960
security related words like two step

970
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
factors something something something

971
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,040
casion

972
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
snapchat and other companies need to

973
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
look at the biggest factors of children

974
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
giving away their password and remove

975
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,200
the threat what do we do in cyber we try

976
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
to

977
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,880
make the threats go away we try to look

978
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
what can be leaked here what can happen

979
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
here what are the biggest threats to my

980
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,240
company i don't give a [ __ ] about your

981
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,440
company

982
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,880
if these kids don't get help

983
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,440
they are very much more important than

984
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,040
your software if you ask me

985
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,839
is a stupid streak to make people use

986
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,320
your application more important than

987
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,800
children's safety health and their lives

988
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,320
what is snapchat streak good for nothing

989
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
it makes us go there and send send snaps

990
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,560
and it makes them get more money as they

991
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,040
didn't have enough from before

992
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,359
it creates a significant risk for

993
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,040
children that they give up their

994
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
passwords

995
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,800
they think it's so important with this

996
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
streak

997
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,160
and

998
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,560
um as i usually say

999
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,119
if these companies and the people who

1000
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,400
are leading them

1001
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
thinks that the streak and other

1002
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,400
not important stuff is more important

1003
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,040
than there is they're facing please meet

1004
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
me at the children's graves and say it

1005
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,880
to my face

1006
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,119
i'm standing there at their graves i

1007
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,800
haven't even met them and i cry

1008
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,760
does the companies do that no

1009
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,200
but i'm telling you to do it

1010
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,560
so i'm i've been talking about really

1011
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,000
heavy stuff this is what i do every day

1012
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
and some people cry when they walk out

1013
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,480
of my talks

1014
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
because the internet is as big as space

1015
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
and that means we don't quite know how

1016
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,960
big it is

1017
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,119
of course you can count everything and

1018
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,040
how many users on this on this platform

1019
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
it's not that i'm talking about we can

1020
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,800
never know anything everything we can

1021
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,960
never know what's there and that means

1022
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,200
we all need to take responsibility it

1023
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,599
means we all need to care and we have to

1024
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,640
face what is actually going on

1025
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,119
i don't care if your platform got hacked

1026
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,520
10 000 kids on your app got hacked

1027
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,720
that's what i care about

1028
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,160
so my title for this presentation you

1029
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280

1030

1057
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,839
questions for mia

1058
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,359
hi um first thank you for the

1059
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,119
presentation and all the information you

1060
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,200
provided in what you do

1061
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
um i had a chance in the past to do work

1062
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
in this capacity with a

1063
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,440
three-letter agency here with the us

1064
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,400
government

1065
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,640
and i was fortunate enough to

1066
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,680
uh be involved in a program i can't

1067
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,280
disclose right now because it's a

1068
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,440
classified um program they could

1069
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
actually assist in what you're doing

1070
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,280
and so my question to you are you aware

1071
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,400
of that program because it did involve

1072
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,760
nations in europe um to to do this and

1073
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
what it entails if you don't know about

1074
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,400
it

1075
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,280
it allows the program to look at images

1076
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,000
videos or whatever else of victims that

1077
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,560
are exploiting in this capacity without

1078
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,480
having to have the human

1079
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,000
element view

1080
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
the the content and have the machine and

1081
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
ai ml components

1082
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,319
analyze that and recognize it from like

1083
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,000
photos that parents or other family

1084
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,079
members provide to the law enforcement

1085
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,000
so that's my first question or that

1086
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
program there are several programs and

1087
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,640
similar stuff around the world and i'm

1088
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,720
not an organization i have a full-time

1089
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,280
job and a dog

1090
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,839
so i can't remember that right now but i

1091
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,240
would love for to hear more sure and

1092
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,960
then my other question is that there's a

1093
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,319
component that i realized um that you

1094
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,359
covered in the beginning of your

1095
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
presentation where in my opinion focuses

1096
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
more on

1097
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,319
human behavior or child development

1098
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,240
approach with like a psychiatrist or

1099
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,480
psychologist to help parents parent

1100
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,400
their kids because it is a big

1101
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,319
responsibility for the parents and the

1102
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,319
lack or ignorance of the parents not

1103
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,079
being able to provide that guidance to

1104
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,720
the kids for passwords or the big

1105
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
spectrum of what you covered so my

1106
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
question to you is have you approached

1107
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,920
that

1108
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,079
within your country or anywhere around

1109
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,480
the world dealing with family

1110
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,400
therapists psychologists psychiatrists

1111
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,200
to

1112
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,440
help or even school systems to help

1113
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,560
educate the kids at that development age

1114
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
so i actually was a part of changing the

1115
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,160
laws in norway

1116
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,359
a year ago

1117
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,119
and i have also made programs for

1118
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,520
parents i have also volunteered for red

1119
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
cross

1120
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,680
i also do about 100 talks a year just

1121
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,880
for parents i also do

1122
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,599
the crisis centers that women go to if

1123
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,640
they're

1124
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,359
if there's digital violence cases i also

1125
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,960
educated the police at the police

1126
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,079
academy

1127
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,960
and i also have everything published

1128
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,560
free for everyone

1129
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,800
um so that's what i've been doing really

1130
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,319
i've been doing this for five years i

1131
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,079
was a full-time student

1132
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,680
and i'm working on some really cool

1133
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,720
stuff um for the rest of the years

1134
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,400
so yeah

1135
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,079
i wanted to talk about this kind of

1136
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,680
stuff on this talk because there's a lot

1137
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,480
of cyber people here but i do talk a lot

1138
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,520
to the grown-ups and teachers at school

1139
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,440
because these children they're being

1140
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,359
taught this in school now in

1141
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,560
kindergarten

1142
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,079
but their parents are 30 40 50 years old

1143
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,680
who taught them

1144
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,359
and why does these people then have the

1145
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,119
responsibility to teach their now

1146
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,480
children we are generation [ __ ] up

1147
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,280
because we grew up with this i was like

1148
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,839
in the middle of this i had the nokia

1149
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,319
and then when i was like 12 i got

1150
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,000
snapchat

1151
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,839
now the kids have tablets before they're

1152
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,280
born you know they used to say that

1153
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,079
norwegians are born with skis

1154
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,400
now they're born with iphones in their

1155
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,160
hands

1156
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,079
so yeah i've been doing a lot of that

1157
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,599
stuff and i would love for you to reach

thank you so much for your talk and

1164
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,640
thank you for your service to the your

1165
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,119
community and our community um my

1166
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,240
question is for me as a dinosaur who

1167
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,880
learned a lot in this hour

1168
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,319
one of the things that really drove the

1169
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,560
point home as sad as it was was kind of

1170
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,720
the anecdotes of the negative outcomes

1171
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
how do you wrestle with communicating

1172
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,960
with kids and trying to teach them the

1173
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
dangers but not over frightening them

1174
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,599
that's a really good question and i get

1175
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,520
that question a lot so i've written a

1176
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,960
children's book

1177
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,440
i use their words i speak to children

1178
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,480
who is six and seven years old and i i

1179
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,040
say poop i say pee

1180
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,119
and i say there is some grown-ups that

1181
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,520
actually want to be your boyfriend or

1182
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,800
your girlfriend

1183
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,839
and and they think this stuff is so cool

1184
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,119
and interesting

1185
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,599
they come and take selfies with me so

1186
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,079
for grown-ups if grown-ups can handle

1187
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,760
what i'm talking about how how can

1188
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,000
children live through them but with

1189
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,079
children i am much more

1190
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,960
positive things guys i'm a gamer

1191
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,079
are you gamers do you play games me too

1192
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,640

1193
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,720
you on fortnite

1194
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,920
i do this so i actually took on my

1195
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,079
school of sports sciences we have our

1196
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,880
own lectures considering children i was

1197
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,760
also a coach for children in taekwondo

1198
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,319
and so i i'm not like this at all to the

1199
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,640
children they laugh and they

1200
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,480
they speak they speak

1201
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,240
to their teachers and they want to be

1202
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
with me afterwards i think i'm doing a

1203
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,839
good thing i haven't received any

1204
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:30,960
complaints

1205
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,720
uh yet

1206
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,680
you never know about that so yeah

1207
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,000
it's much more cute

1208
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and i don't speak about like

1209
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,040
people kill themselves two six-year-olds

1210
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,280
it's more like they they can get really

1211
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
pain in their hearts

1212
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,560
you know

1213
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,359

[Music]

1221
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
i was

1222
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,960
given the

1223
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,839
the sort of social psychological bonding

1224
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,880
relationship trust

1225
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,800
sharing things

1226
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,040
even if snapchat disappeared tomorrow

1227
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,279
their

1228
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,400
people and kids are still going to be

1229
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,559
sharing their passwords it's not

1230
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,400
something

1231
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
um

1232
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,480
so

1233
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,359
i don't know what

1234
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,000
we can do you know what we here can do

1235
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,400
about that other than

1236
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,960
trying to develop techniques to safely

1237
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,720
share passwords

1238
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,880
you know for example you know you know

1239
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,680
so you know

1240
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
you know technologies where you can have

1241
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
like sub passwords i'm sorry i don't

1242
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,240
want to show throw out more terminology

1243
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,480
that nobody understands

1244
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,520
but

1245
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,599
maybe

1246
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,280
instead of saying

1247
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,440
don't share passwords

1248
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,599
when you know that that's not going to

1249
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,800
work

1250
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,240
find a way

1251
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,200
to help them do what they want yeah

1252
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
safely yeah

1253
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,240
exactly

1254
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,880
and also parents ask me because i say

1255
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,280
that if you say to your child remember

1256
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
to never take a nude photo of yourself

1257
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,440
and never send it to anyone

1258
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,520
then you are the last person that child

1259
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,359
will come to when that happens because

1260
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,680
they're so scared of you

1261
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,599
so when i educate parents i say instead

1262
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,000
of saying that directly and you slam the

1263
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,640
door and you lock it

1264
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,400
do what i do to children i tell them

1265
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,079
what can happen

1266
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,960
and to be careful and i talk about safe

1267
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,000
sexting instead do not show your face if

1268
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,760
you have tattoos like i'm [ __ ]

1269
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,040
obviously

1270
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,200
i will show up oh i have tattoos here

1271
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,800
too yeah i'm [ __ ]

1272
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,599
um i get up my eyeball

1273
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,760
that's my nude photo

1274
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,800
so i say let them think themselves and

1275
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,640
that comes back to googling

1276
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,000
don't just tell them stuff because

1277
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,800
they're not going to listen

1278
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,119
show them the consequences we actually

1279
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,440
made two tv shows in norway

1280
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,280
where i look through the everything the

1281
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,040
transcript everything

1282
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,640
one for the younger one someone for the

1283
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,040
older ones who showed stories

1284
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,359
and who helped the victims and didn't

1285
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,720
shame anyone

1286
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,880
and people were so shocked they won

1287
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,839
awards for these tv shows and i tell

1288
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,000
parents to show their kids this and it

1289
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,160
creates a perfect opportunity to talk

1290
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,680
about it so after seeing this what

1291
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,599
do you know if anyone in your class had

1292
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,839
their photos leaked

1293
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,240
that's a better way than just have you

1294
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,480
shared your naked photo

1295
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,920
so i actually tell that to parents as

1296
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,599
well and i totally agree with what

1297
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,079
you're saying as well but also i think

1298
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,800
that if i can make just one kid think

1299
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,680
twice by adding a must for two to step

1300
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,520
blogging then it's worth it because that

1301
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,000
kid might be dead now and i have spoken

1302
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,760
to dead children

1303
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,960
not oh that sounded weird

1304
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,559
but i've been talking to them and the

1305
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,319
next time i get a message is the parent

1306
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,240
saying thank you for trying to help our

1307
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,599
child so if i can just save one child by

1308
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,559
adding two factor

1309
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,200
and that company spends a bit more of

1310
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,520
their very nice party

1311
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,960
money

1312
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,599
on saving that one child

1313
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,040
that's the only thing i care about i

1314
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,079
don't care if if it goes from 59 because

1315
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
of snapchat streak to 58 because if you

1316
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,480
see how many children in the world that

1317
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,480
thousands of children

1318
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,160
that maybe now

1319
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,640
still have a life

1320
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,280
