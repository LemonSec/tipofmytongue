1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,280
today we have with us jeffrey goldberg

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
from one password

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,240
uh

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
i'm gonna say you you're becoming a

5

permanent resident

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,480
of password scon more or less

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,759
um

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,799

always have interesting talks in my

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,240
opinion uh he's a great guy to talk to

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,199
as well

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,439
i know he loves getting questions so

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,279
prepare for every questions that you

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,760
have for him after the talk or also

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
initially in in the breaks afterwards as

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,960
well

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
and uh

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,200
he's here to talk about can a password

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
management service safely learn about

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
users passwords take it away jeff

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,760
hello

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,079
okay uh

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,320
you can all hear me

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
um

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,160
so first of all it's

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
really great to be here it's great to

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
see pear here it's

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
been a while since you've been in las

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
vegas at these conferences

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,719
um

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,239
and as he

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
said i've actually you know been part of

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
passwords khan one way or another for a

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
long time

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,439
and i remember my first talk

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,479
was in 2013

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
over the golden nugget

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
and i was the first

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,680
talk on the program other than pair's

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
introduction

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
and you know i mean i'm a dilettante

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
academic that's really what i am i'm a

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
phd dropout in linguistics from a long

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
time ago

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
and

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,640
things went to sleep

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
okay i hope the things that went to

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
sleep are not you or at least not yet

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,919
um

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,000
do i need to plug this into power for

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,880
this there we go okay so i'll just

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
i'll just do stuffs okay so i'll fiddle

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,759
here awesome

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,719
that's not what i wanted

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
okay i won't do that um

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,320
you know so

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,759
so

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,399
i

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
came in i had no idea what the audience

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,000
was going to be like or i had an idea

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
and i was wrong

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,239
so

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,560
the first talk i ever gave at a

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,560
passwords con was basically math from

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
beginning to end

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,239
and so

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,000
this time

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,480
i'm talking about something that

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,200
could involve a lot of math and i've

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,560
left all of it out

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
so

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,200
uh

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,800
so uh anyway so that's it um

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,760
now one of the things that pair just

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
said i said that people are often

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
reluctant

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,480
to give honest answers

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
to certain sorts of questions on a

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,519
survey

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,959
um

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,400
this is

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,440
uh

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,959
in some fields called the social

84
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,400
desirability effect

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
on you know in survey design and purdue

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,800
and

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
uh as it happens i'm going to be talking

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
a lot about

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
soliciting honest answers

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
to very sensitive questions

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,120
okay so let me just set the scene

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
um

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,440
i am uh jeffrey goldberg i've been

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,319
working

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,840
at one password for uh

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
12 years

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
i can do subtraction

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,480
um

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
i really want to know

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,599
everything and there are certain things

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,280
that i absolutely do not want to know

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,040
and

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
we'll get to that

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,560
now one password is a password manager

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
um

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,640
we have client software that people run

107
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,920
on their own devices and a service

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,879
um

109
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,840
used

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
largely for synchronization but for

111
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
other things as well

112
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
the client software is where most of the

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,238
action is this is all just background i

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,280
should have a kitten up there i don't um

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
but just imagine a kitten if you know

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,759
all of this stuff um

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,720
uh

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
the unlocked client

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,600
knows certain things like the names of

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
your vaults and the titles of your items

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
and those sorts of things the server

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,440
doesn't

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
um

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
and the unlocked client knows the

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,880
strengths of your various passwords to

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
the extent that password strength can be

127
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
measured we've talked about that

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
elsewhere and have other conferences

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,639
um

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,479
uh client you know

131
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,360
so all of the all of the usual stuff

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,400
and

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
uh

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
the overall design and architecture of

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
the system is so that we know as little

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,080
about user secrets as possible

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
but we also

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,440
think

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
that we know a thing or two about

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
password behavior

141
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
you know maybe by relying on shitty

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,600
surveys

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
um

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
or maybe not but

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,240
but we we we certainly have opinions and

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
we certainly believe that we know

147
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
something about passive behavior

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,560
um

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880
and

150
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,680
uh

151
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
broadly

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,560
one of the things i'm interested in is

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
what can we learn

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
about a one password user's behavior

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
without putting them at any risk

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,880
and what technologies for doing so are

157
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
within our reach

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
and so

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
i'm going to actually

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,639
present

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
a sample research question because it it

162
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
it

163
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,319
gives an extreme case

164
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,199
uh if we can understand and research

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
this and look at this then we can pretty

166
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,280
much do anything safely

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,000
so something that i've said at previous

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
password cons

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
is that

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,759
people who enable 2fa for their password

171
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,800
manager

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
will tend to use weaker account

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
passwords

174
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
than they otherwise would

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,680
and

176
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
i've given a couple presentations about

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
that and why i believe that and other

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,639
things about

179
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,080
misunderstandings of what multi-factor

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
authentication does

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
and how those get implied

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,759
and how that impacts the case of of

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
using it for password manager it doesn't

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
matter whether you believe me or not

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
doesn't matter whether i believe me or

186
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
not

187
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,080
um i would like to know whether that's

188
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,080
true

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,440
so

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
in more research terms is there a

191
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
negative correlation between use of 2fa

192
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
for one password itself

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
and the strength of the account password

194
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
now i'm going to tell you i'm not

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
answering this question today we don't

196
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,479
know i'm it's what i am actually going

197
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,000
into

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,039
about fine that's a few slides later um

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
uh we do know whether people have

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,599
whether a user has 2fa for one password

201
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
enabled because that is something that

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,360
is done server-side

203
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
um

204
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
we do not know

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,479
the password strength

206
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,000
of anybody's account password

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
um

208
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
and we really don't ever want to know

209
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
the password strength of anybody's

210
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,000
account password

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,319
uh we don't want to

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
put anybody or anything in a higher risk

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
of cracking against uh against their

214
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,440
password

215
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
uh so i don't really think i need to

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,720
list the reasons

217
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,039
and that's also largely because i was

218
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
putting the slides together on an

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,958
airplane and i decided to skip this one

220
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
okay

221
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,519
so um

222
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
uh

223
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
so there are things that we don't want

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,320
to know

225
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
but we also want to make it absolutely

226
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
clear

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,959
that we don't know and that we don't

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,279
have the capacity to know

229
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
so not knowing is not enough people need

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
to know

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,439
that we're ignorant of these things

232
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
okay so

233
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
i've been thinking about this problem

234
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,640
and this example

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,760
and what you're going to get is a

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
more or less what's a preliminary

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
progress report on my thinking

238
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
with no actual answers to the questions

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,640
and for those of you who are familiar

240
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,440
with differential privacy and embedded

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
in those communities

242
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
everything i say here is going to be

243
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
most of what i say here is going to be a

244
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,519
review of what you already know

245
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,560
um

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,000
and so

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
i won't be insulted if you get up and

248
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,640
walk away but

249
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
uh

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
hopefully even for you there might be

251
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,640
something new or interesting here or at

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
least you can correct me when i'm wrong

253
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
about stuff

254
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,320
okay

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,839
so

256
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
we have clients that have sensitive data

257
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
when they're unlocked their sensitive

258
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,760
data is decrypted within the clients

259
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
only

260
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
and

261
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,720
we want to do some data analysis

262
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
um

263
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
you know across a broad number of users

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
and so

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,120
the general is that the client

266
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
would do something with the sensitive

267
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,000
data

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
and then report it up to some service

269
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,560
outside of the users and clients control

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,440
that's

271
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,000
the structure of how

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,839
gathering such data would work

273
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
and

274
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
you know everybody's first correct

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
reaction

276
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
is

277
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
well you collect the data but you keep

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
it anonymous you remove all identifiers

279
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
um

280
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
and you know it you can remove all

281
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
identifiers that the client sends

282
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
you still have ip addresses unless you

283
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,560
go to other measures to not have ip

284
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
addresses

285
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
so potentially something like this could

286
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,560
be done through tor or something similar

287
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680
again

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
you know it's saying is that yes we

289
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
could promise

290
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,839
to remove ip addresses

291
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
but we want this to be transparent to

292
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
the user in the security

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
community that

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
uh

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
that this these privacy guarantees are

296
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
there

297
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,519
de-anonymization is a real thing

298
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,560
um

299
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
so anonymization is hard in the first

300
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,839
place

301
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,640
the

302
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
common

303
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,399
practice of simply hashing

304
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,600
the

305
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
identifying information

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,800
is

307
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
bad breakable reversible for reasons i'm

308
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
not going to go into here it's really

309
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
common it's just not the way to do such

310
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,880
things

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
but they're always doing

312
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
uh

313
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
you should

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
you should design your system under the

315
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
assumption that your data will leak

316
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
again this has been a principle that

317
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,560
we've used at one password since the

318
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
beginning

319
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
um

320
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
uh but

321
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
uh anonymized data even properly

322
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
anonymized data when combined with other

323
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
data

324
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
can be de-anonymized in very important

325
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
and surprising ways

326
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
and depending on time i'll run through

327
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,320
an example of that at the end

328
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,519
very famous case with netflix and i with

329
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,040
netflix but

330
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
uh it really is the case and that other

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,839
public

332
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,959
data that things get combined with

333
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,839
is

334
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,240
data that comes from other places not

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,639
from you you have zero control of it

336
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,240
you've got zero control of the

337
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
publication of that other data

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
and furthermore

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
you have to design your system

340
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,279
to resist de-anonymization

341
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,040
um

342
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
when the anonymization

343
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,079
could

344
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,360
be against public data that doesn't even

345
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,920
exist yet

346
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,240
uh so

347
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,920
uh

348
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
uh so

349
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,160
de-anonymization is a thing

350
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,120
which leads to this major point is that

351
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
good anonymization and data protection

352
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
is absolutely necessary

353
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,920
but they are far from sufficient

354
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,040
so

355
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
uh

356
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,839
one

357
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
approach is to

358
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
simply have the client be

359
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,519
answer

360
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
vaguely instead of giving you the

361
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,360
precise password strength to the extent

362
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
that the password knows it

363
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
it could lump it into let's say one of

364
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,399
three bins

365
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,519
you know a low medium high you know so

366
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
so you add some vagueness to it

367
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,319
and

368
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
but for

369
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
additionally there's the notion of what

370
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
is called the random response technique

371
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
which is actually in a sense a precursor

372
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
to differential privacy

373
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
um

374
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,079
and it goes back to the 1960s so this

375
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,920
example i cite here is from a paper in

376
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,279
the 70s

377
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,399
um

378
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
so subjects were given a questionnaire

379
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,160
uh but told to roll a die before

380
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,199
answering each question

381
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,480
and if they rolled one through four they

382
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,360
were supposed to answer honestly

383
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,440
if they were to

384
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,279
roll to five they were supposed to

385
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,959
answer yes

386
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,320
and if

387
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,279
they rolled a six they were supposed to

388
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,199
answer no

389
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
and uh

390
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,720
and this increased response rates

391
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
and

392
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,959
through other analyses by comparing with

393
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,800
other methods and and statistical um

394
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
cleverness

395
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,279
uh

396
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,800
you could see that it actually increased

397
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,319
honest response rates

398
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
uh so

399
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
so again the in a sense the randomness

400
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,240
of this

401
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,199
uh

402
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,160
was transparent to the user

403
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,199
and

404
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,320
uh and made them feel safe answering

405
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
honestly

406
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
um

407
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,000
uh another study conducted in mexico in

408
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
2001

409
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
where

410
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
abortion was highly stigmatized and

411
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
illegal used

412
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,360
another form of random response

413
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
and

414
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
uh

415
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,440
people were given a red and green

416
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,279
question

417
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,720
and they

418
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
pulled a red or green

419
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,160
thing out of a sack they knew that there

420
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
was just one red and green thing in the

421
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,479
sack

422
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,000
and if they drew red

423
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,839
and of course the researcher the

424
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,040
interviewer did not see what people drew

425
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
um and this was again transparent to the

426
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
subject

427
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
they answered uh did you ever interrupt

428
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,199
a pregnancy or green

429
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,600
were you born in april

430
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,560
now from census data they knew how many

431
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
people in the women in this age group

432
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
were

433
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
were born in april and we're able to do

434
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
some statistics on this and

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
um

436
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
uh i've got in my speaker notes which

437
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,919
you're not displaying here

438
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,119
but i think it was around 16

439
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,559
of women in this range

440
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,919
in a sense yeah i mean after

441
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,480
anyway see so they estimated for the

442
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,280
population given the way they sampled

443
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
that 16 percent of women um had had an

444
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
abortion

445
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
okay uh and so

446
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,840
various statistical techniques here

447
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,640
various statistical techniques here

448
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,679
have demonstrated that this stuff is

449
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
effective at

450
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,559
at getting more honest responses

451
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,400
um and in enough that in it and it does

452
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,039
that enough to easily make up for the

453
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,120
statistical noise

454
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
introduced by

455
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,919
this uh

456
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
and in these cases

457
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
um

458
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,360
went the wrong way um

459
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,720
uh so

460
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,039
let's suppose we were to set up a system

461
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,000
that had answered honestly about

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
password strength fifty percent of the

463
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
time

464
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
um

465
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,640
uh and otherwise pick let's say the

466
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
three bins randomly

467
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
are

468
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,400
uh if our data leaks and is

469
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
de-anonymized

470
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,320
is the user sufficiently protected

471
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,440
and

472
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
the answer is

473
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,160
i don't know yet

474
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,039
um

475
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,000
but that's for later because i haven't

476
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,080
looked through the order of my slides

477
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
okay

478
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
so

479
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,080
these techniques add statistical noise

480
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,039
um

481
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,760
they reduce the statistical power of the

482
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
tests

483
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
and

484
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,480
the consequence of this is that you

485
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
either need a larger sample

486
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,039
or you end up with

487
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,400
or you end up with wider

488
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,200
confidence intervals

489
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
okay

490
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
now

491
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
where differential privacy comes in

492
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,080
differential privacy

493
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,559
it's really really hard to explain what

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,120
it is without the math

495
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,000
um

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
so i'm going to try to explain what it

497
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
attempts to do

498
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
and it is about limiting the possibility

499
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,240
of de-anonymization it's an

500
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,919
anti-de-anonymization technique

501
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,960
um

502
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,520
and it provides a

503
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
common mathematical notion of

504
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
of the protections of some data set in

505
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,039
this in this respect

506
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,440
but across a wide variety of techniques

507
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,799
and uses

508
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,600
it does add statistical noise in ways

509
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
that are similar to the vague and random

510
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,679
response stuff

511
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,000
and

512
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,400
the noise it adds is designed to have

513
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
certain statistical properties that make

514
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,200
it easy to combine

515
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
easy to reason about when you combine it

516
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,399
with other things

517
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,280
um okay

518
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,960
it is not a single technique

519
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,039
it is not something

520
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,159
that

521
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
is only done at

522
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,320
this stage of some data analysis and

523
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,919
collection

524
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,400
and it is not particularly easy

525
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,080
so

526
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
when i said that it can be applied at

527
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,320
different places or implied that it

528
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,520
could be applied at different places

529
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,480
it can be done at data collection time

530
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,360
it can be done to

531
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,559
transform a data set that you have

532
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,039
that does not have

533
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,000
privacy guarantees into a data set that

534
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
does have

535
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
differential privacy guarantees

536
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,880
and it can be done at query time you've

537
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,159
got a data with sensitive data that is

538
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,440
at risk of de-anonymization

539
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,159
but it's also differential privacy can

540
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,760
be applied

541
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,039
as

542
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,640
what analyses you do on the data and

543
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
adding its magic noise

544
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
to those queries

545
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,559
uh so that the reports you get out of it

546
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,799
could be safely published

547
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,039
um

548
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,559
now

549
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
there are

550
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,360
really really nice tools

551
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,000
that are coming to be available and

552
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,640
usable by people who don't have phds in

553
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,559
math

554
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,159
for

555
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
for the third one of those and to

556
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
a

557
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,120
lesser extent the first the second one

558
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,159
but in our case

559
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,720
we never want to have the data in the

560
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
first place

561
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,679
so we need these things to be applied

562
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,600
and done by the client

563
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,679
um

564
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,799
what would

565
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
what would be required

566
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,120
uh if we're to go beyond the random

567
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
response stuff

568
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
would be

569
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
uh something called homomorphic

570
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,039
encryption it's a fancy scary name

571
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,120
uh

572
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,919
for actually magic i'm sorry it's just

573
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,960
magic

574
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,840
um

575
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
so

576
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
the paper that first introduced it

577
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
without this terminology

578
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
was in 1982

579
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,120
and it set up the question

580
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,080
two millionaires wish to know who is

581
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
richer however

582
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,679
they do not want to find out

583
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,440
inadvertently

584
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
and

585
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,799
they do not want to find out

586
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,520
inadvertently any additional information

587
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
about each other's wealth

588
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,559
and i should also add

589
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,679
that they do not want any third party

590
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,360
to know either

591
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
uh how can they carry out such a

592
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
conversation

593
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
so when you look at a problem like this

594
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,400
you would say they use a trusted third

595
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
party

596
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,840
the trusted third party

597
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
will learn

598
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
the wealth of each

599
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
also millionaires seem to be have been

600
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
different back then um

601
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
now they would be boasting about their

602
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
anyway never mind um

603
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,760
i need to stay on track here okay so

604
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
um

605
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,640
uh you know so the

606
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
normal way of thinking about this is

607
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,000
that you have a trusted third party you

608
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
do various things to ensure your

609
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,679
trustability of that third party but the

610
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
third party gets both numbers and then

611
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,520
simply reports back he reports back

612
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,080
uh who's richard

613
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,720
um

614
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
oh and i keep on doing that okay

615
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
uh

616
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
well the particular paper there

617
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,520
uh developed a technique

618
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,559
to

619
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
solve this problem

620
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,080
and a bunch of similar problems

621
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
uh

622
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,679
without the need of a trusted third

623
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,840
party

624
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
and

625
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,559
yeah no math

626
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,360
magic it's done by magic

627
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,559
um

628
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,440
but

629
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,120
it's done by magic in polynomial time

630
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,400
and space

631
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
and that is very important

632
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,159
uh so and in general

633
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,120
for

634
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,919
uh it was proven

635
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,799
in subsequent work for this paper

636
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,840
uh for any protocol that can run in

637
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
polynomial time

638
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,400
using a trusted third party there's a

639
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
protocol that can produce the same

640
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
result without the trusted third party

641
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,720
in polynomial time

642
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,120
and so it allows multiple parties to

643
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,679
compute things over their individual

644
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,799
secrets

645
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,440
without revealing those individual

646
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
secrets to each other

647
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,159
or to a third party

648
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,120
and so this is this is

649
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
generally what homomorphic encryption is

650
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,919
about uh

651
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,080
multi-party computation

652
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,440
um

653
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,320
so

654
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,880
the practicalities of of this stuff

655
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,679
uh

656
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,240
i still think it needs a phd to make

657
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,880
real use of it um

658
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,039
the libraries and tools are getting

659
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,559
better but

660
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,760
yeah

661
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,039
um

662
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,679
polynomial time in space doesn't

663
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,840
actually mean fast and small

664
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,960
and so

665
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
even though

666
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,360
the theory of this stuff

667
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,400
was developed 40 years ago

668
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
the reason that we're only seeing these

669
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,799
techniques used in the last

670
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,080
five

671
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
maybe 10 years

672
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,360
is because it actually takes a lot of

673
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,200
computation

674
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,080
um and the protocols used actually have

675
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,679
a lot of back and forth they're

676
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,840
complicated protocols

677
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,360
so

678
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,679
i'm going to say that that technique is

679
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,120
still beyond our reach when i started

680
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,039
investigating i was hoping otherwise but

681
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,399
um but we're still there now

682
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,679
i do want to make an aside

683
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,559
on the adding noise

684
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,320
so sorry i know you're all passwords

685
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
people and here i am talking about you

686
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,279
know stuff but again

687
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,640
focusing on the example of

688
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,440
of

689
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
anyone who's doing research into user's

690
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,640
behavior of passwords

691
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,520
you know this is this

692
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,600
all this stuff is relevant even if

693
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
general to many other cases

694
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,880
uh

695
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
one of the objections

696
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,559
that

697
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
see so there have been cases where

698
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,159
people have provided

699
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,559
differential privacy techniques as a

700
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,000
real clear viable usable

701
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,200
alternative to what uh to what systems

702
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,880
are doing

703
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,760
and

704
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,559
their

705
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,480
clients you know the people that they

706
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
were developing this for

707
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
or trying to get to use it

708
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,600
uh

709
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,039
would

710
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
okay i got ahead of myself uh would

711
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,600
complain about the statistical noise

712
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,880
added

713
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,039
these techniques add noise

714
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,080
um

715
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,640
but they had a quantifiable and well

716
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
understood amount of noise

717
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,039
and so you either need

718
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,320
a larger sample or you accept wider

719
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,960
confidence intervals

720
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,080
but

721
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,199
i've heard cases

722
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,840
usually from other people who've been

723
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,320
trying to get this to work

724
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,159
where they run up against people saying

725
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,000
we can't accept anything with

726
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,559
statistical error or confidence

727
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
intervals

728
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
well

729
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,960
if you're doing data analysis

730
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,440
with or without this stuff

731
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
you have statistical noise error terms

732
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
confidence intervals

733
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,200
that is simply a part of working

734
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
of working with data and doing any

735
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
analysis of it

736
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,679
and

737
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,960
uh

738
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,600
so my big mean rant um

739
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
uh

740
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
is this

741
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
if you can't handle statistical error

742
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
or you don't know that you always have

743
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,120
some you should not call yourself a data

744
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
analyst

745
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
um

746
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,039
and i am being far less polite than the

747
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
people i know who've encountered these

748
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
objections

749
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,200
they couldn't say it i can

750
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,320
um

751
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,640
partially because nobody's hitting me

752
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
with the oh we can't do statistical

753
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,200
noise stuff if people were hitting me

754
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,640
with that i probably couldn't get away

755
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,320
with saying this

756
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
um okay and that's also an indication of

757
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
why i don't have friends

758
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,960
so

759
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,799
uh conclusions

760
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,279
is there a combination

761
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,480
of of of there should be an oven there a

762
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,200
combination of vagueness random response

763
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,919
and data protections on the acquired

764
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,880
data that would offer sufficient

765
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
guarantees for our users and allow us to

766
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,320
answer the 2fa strength question with

767
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,279
sufficient confidence

768
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,000
i still don't know

769
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
this is a work in progress

770
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
i thought

771
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,440
that i would be able to

772
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
figure out what

773
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,000
how strong of an effect

774
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
there need to be in the real world about

775
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,320
those things combined with these

776
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,559
techniques

777
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,519
to then estimate what sample sizes were

778
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,120
needed

779
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,000
but my math isn't quite up to the task

780
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
that i thought it was when i started the

781
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,919
project

782
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,919
okay so

783
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
i actually

784
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,360
finished

785
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,960
um oh netflix case right okay

786
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
so i actually finished the guts of my

787
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,279
talk much much earlier because i only

788
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,640
noticed a couple days ago that i had 55

789
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
minutes instead of

790
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,799
instead of 25

791
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,799
but

792
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,919
i think it's useful to go over the

793
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,159
netflix case of de-anonymization that i

794
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,399
talked about again i'm sorry it's not

795
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,159
really passwords but it's about

796
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,360
preserving user secrets

797
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
so way back when

798
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,559
ah

799
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,960
good i have it on the slide in

800
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,440
uh 2006

801
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,720
netflix

802
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,799
really wanted

803
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,000
people to

804
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,559
really wanted an algorithm or to improve

805
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,519
their algorithms at predicting what

806
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,640
things to recommend to people

807
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,120
and so they publicly released an

808
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,279
anonymized data set

809
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
of about

810
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,399
100 million movie ratings from

811
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,480
nearly half a million subscribers

812
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
uh

813
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
and all customer identifying information

814
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,480
has been removed

815
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,880
all that remains are ratings and dates

816
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,880
now

817
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
people might have

818
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,519
dozens or maybe a hundred different

819
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,919
netflix ratings at the time or maybe

820
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
more

821
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,360
but people also

822
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,799
rated

823
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,840
um

824
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,200
things

825
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,159
publicly on imdb

826
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,760
now

827
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,440
they

828
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,919
you know they will have for the imdb

829
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,559
stuff they knew that that was public and

830
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,360
so they were okay letting the world know

831
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
that they watched that

832
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
if they also watched

833
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,519
um you know

834
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,080
uh if they watched again and again and

835
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,679
rated highly nickelback's world tour

836
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,559
um

837
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,640
they that's something that you know you

838
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
wouldn't want anybody to know about

839
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,240
you know and there are other things that

840
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,840
people might watch

841
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,279
that uh

842
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,000
um you know that that they don't want

843
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,799
the world to know that they watched but

844
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
they rated them with netflix

845
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,399
but not with imdb

846
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,679
so

847
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
uh a paper

848
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,480
in 2008

849
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,679
showed

850
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,200
that even with just a tiny number of

851
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,480
imdb ratings

852
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,000
you could de-anonymize

853
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,679
almost all

854
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,280
of

855
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
um

856
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,599
you could de-anonymize almost all of the

857
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,639
netflix data

858
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,079
and so

859
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,199
this is this is why i wanted to

860
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,599
emphasize that de-anonymization is a

861
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,119
real thing

862
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,320
and it is against data that may not even

863
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,719
exist yet when you are designing your

864
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,239
system

865
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,440
and

866
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,119
uh

867
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
and so differential privacy

868
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,679
is designed in a sense to add a certain

869
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,879
amount of

870
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,119
noise to let's say the data that netflix

871
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,639
published in ways that would prevent

872
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,399
this or any other kind of

873
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,480
de-anonymization

874
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
um

875
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,359
okay and

876
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,598
uh

877
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
there are other examples there have been

878
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,960
many many more cases of cases of

879
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,320
de-anonymization but that one is really

880
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,760
dramatic and

881
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,920
much simpler to explain

882
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
uh so

883
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
um

884
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,839
uh

885
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,359
so

886
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,720
i don't have an answer for those who for

887
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
those running password managers

888
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,920
who want to study

889
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,800
their users passwords behaviors

890
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,839
but

891
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,359
it's not

892
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,200
fully out of reach it's just not quite

893
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,240
within reach yet

894
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
but these are the kinds of things you

895
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
need to look out for when designing such

896
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,720
a system

897
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,959
and with that i will take questions

898
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
thanks jeff um

899
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,599
i'll i'll ignore the

900
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,839
homomorphic thing because i don't have

901
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,599
the math either

902
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,079
but when you talk about adding noise to

903
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
a measurement in order to

904
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,120
uh in order to

905
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,150
[Music]

906
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,400
add a little bit of uncertainty about

907
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,200
the the answer to the question

908
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,160
in the case of um

909
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,720
the you know maybe the the the the

910
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,560
master password for your password

911
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,920
manager

912
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,440
the thing that the reason that you might

913
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,079
be sensitive about the answer

914
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,920
really has to do with whether you know

915
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,800
em

916
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,680
am i an easy target to hack or not

917
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,839
uh

918
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,560
if you're adding noise to it

919
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,200
aren't you if it's additive noise aren't

920
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
don't you still end up with

921
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,160
just

922
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,440
a larger

923
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,599
probability that

924
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,480
you're easy to hack

925
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,520
the noise can have a negative sign

926
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
if that answers your question no okay in

927
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,240
that case i've misunderstood the

928
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,680
question

929
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
um

930
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
uh

931
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,160
you know so

932
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
you know so the noise can add or

933
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
subtract

934
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
values but obviously i've misunderstood

935
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
the question

936
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,200
right well let's say that you have a a

937
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,760
scale of 0 to 10

938
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,839
for the strength of your master password

939
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,680
where 0 is you use pairs license plate

940
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,640
and 10 is you use something that was

941
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,480
really really good

942
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
and long probably

943
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,720
um if you're adding a certain amount of

944
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,240
noise to it

945
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,000
and you end up with an answer that is

946
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
8.5

947
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,920
it's still likely that that 8.5 came

948
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,760
from the fact that the

949
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,599
the original number was 10. on the other

950
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,480
hand if it if you end up with a

951
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
it did maybe it depends on the

952
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,480
distribution of the noise

953
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,680
right so uh two things one

954
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,839
yeah okay uh

955
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,040
so yes

956
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
um

957
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,119
you know you can

958
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
if the date is de-anonymized

959
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,480
um

960
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,800
then you can make broad guesses of the

961
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,960
true value

962
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,800
based on the reported value um

963
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,760
uh

964
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,119
so

965
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,280
you combine this

966
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,599
and and in a sense you have to be able

967
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,359
to do that for there to be any data

968
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,240
analysis possibility whatsoever

969
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,960
so

970
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,640
uh

971
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,440
so

972
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,880
that's why

973
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,040
by

974
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,400
um my question of whether something like

975
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,200
the random response thing

976
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
is

977
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,720
with the data protections with the

978
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,839
anonymization is enough and it's why my

979
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,720
answer to that question is i don't know

980
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,280
you use wide bins so you wouldn't use

981
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
you wouldn't ever have a report like 8.5

982
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,359
on a scale of 10

983
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,480
i was thinking much more of a one two or

984
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,760
three

985
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,839
and the integer values

986
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,040
um

987
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,920
so you

988
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,520
so you have a vague response

989
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,839
then additionally the noise and

990
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,280
but yes the question is

991
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,480
is are you still leaking if this data

992
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,520
leaks

993
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,079
too much information

994
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,079
and

995
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
i don't know and i do you know it's it's

996
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,079
hard to quantify the notion of leaking

997
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,680
too much

998
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,480
there are ways to do it in differential

999
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,599
privacy terms where you can

1000
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,599
where you can at least know how much

1001
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,280
you're leaking

1002
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,520
and so we can analyze this to know how

1003
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,460
much we're leaking

1004
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,520
[Music]

1005
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,400
but in the end it's a whole big risk

1006
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
analysis thing so maybe

1007
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,040
you know with what you say is what i'm

1008
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,079
trying to do here is impossible

1009
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,359
i

1010
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,839
hope not

1011
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,560
but i recognize the possibility that

1012
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,000
what i'm attempting to do here is

1013
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,560
impossible

1014
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,960
yeah so i have a question myself i was

1015
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,640
just wondering um thank you for the

1016
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,040
presentation by the way it was great um

1017
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,000
i'm curious from your comments regarding

1018
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,560
it's being impossible but close reach

1019
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
are you currently researching this and

1020
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,560
if so where are you with your current

1021
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,560
research

1022
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,079
so when you say researching this it's

1023
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,800
like uh

1024
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,200
this top the topic that you're referring

1025
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,839
to regarding deadly

1026
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,480
change

1027
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,560
whether or not to

1028
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,960
analyze a user's passwords

1029
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,160
so

1030
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720
this is a

1031
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,280
work in progress research report where

1032
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,240
progress is just beginning

1033
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,000
but

1034
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,720
i'm trying to at least put up

1035
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
stuff and right now it's just like

1036
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,720
placeholder documents

1037
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
uh but

1038
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,319
this

1039
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,200
is uh uh this repo here

1040
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,440
again it's mostly placeholder documents

1041
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
and the slides for this talk once i

1042
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,880
merge them into main

1043
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,319
um

1044
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,280
uh

1045
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,400
on privacy preserving analytics

1046
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,359
so

1047
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,560
yes

1048
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,319
we're researching it

1049
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,640
um

1050
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,920
but it's slow it's preliminary it's just

1051
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,640
at the beginnings

1052
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,760
uh jeff great topic very intriguing so

1053
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,280
thank you very much

1054
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,640
uh let's say to answer that question we

1055
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,319
compute the

1056
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,000
entropy on client side for the password

1057
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,520
and then we encrypt the entropy answer

1058
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,920
whether it is high or low let's say we

1059
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,599
don't have three values but just two

1060
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,280
high or low

1061
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,160
using uh homomorphic encryption uh

1062
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,599
especially

1063
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
the one that is used for e-voting

1064
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,520
is called

1065
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,200
pilear homomorphic encryption

1066
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,240
pi layer homomorphic encryption and then

1067
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,480
send it to the server side

1068
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,079
um

1069
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,480
on server side we don't have to

1070
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,119
decrypt the ciphertext to know the value

1071
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,040
whether it is high or low

1072
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,480
just by applying the same e-boating

1073
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,359
verification scheme we can find out

1074
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,880
whether the password has low entropy

1075
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,119
or high entropy and then correlate with

1076
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,480
the

1077
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,680
2fa

1078
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,480
okay so so i

1079
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,960
was not aware aware of that technique

1080
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,640
but if i understand correctly there are

1081
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,119
tools and known

1082
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,720
techniques for collecting binary data

1083
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,359
and so if we just take this as a high or

1084
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,960
low binary

1085
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,359
then there are tools you can actually

1086
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,319
use

1087
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,520
um thank you very much uh you have my

1088
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,240
contact information please send me

1089
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,000
the the actual link

1090
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
any more questions for jeff

1091
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,440
no okay so thank you once again jeff
