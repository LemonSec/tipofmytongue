00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,199
because she looks into

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,760
how she can abuse whatever kind of app

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,719

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800
them

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
now um

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
first password managers i assume you

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,239
know

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,239
what they are please not if you know

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,960
what a password manager is

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
okay i'm just gonna say this anyway

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
password managers are really useful

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,760
tools to manage passwords

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,799
uh pass keys pin codes passwords like

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,040
all of this i'm going to say passwords

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,880
but it's going to cover all the other

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
type of secrets as well

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,159
it's really useful to do this in

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,920
businesses as well like it's good for

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
you as a private individual but in

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,159
businesses you really need to

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
um

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,360
manage uh a lot of passwords that first

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,280
some reason or another

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
must be shared

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
like

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
uh routers don't really care that you

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
have a lot of admins they only have one

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
password all the admins need to know

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,960
that password and so on

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
but even if you are uh buying the

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,960
software or tool

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
and rolling out of the company there's a

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
lot of people even though it's useful

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,240
that won't be using it

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
it's kind of annoying like this is

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
really good for you why wouldn't you be

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,520
using this tool

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,878
and this is what my talk is about

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
um

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,760
the opportunity to see me alonseem's

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
talk yesterday about why the kids

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
couldn't care less about your password

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680

in mia's talk she talks about how

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,519
kids the young people are sharing

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,599
passwords and why it's important for

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,239
them to share passwords and also she

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,760
talks about the consequences of sharing

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
passwords and what's going on

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
and it's important that we who influence

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,640
uh policies um products

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040

context that the kids are in and the

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
habits that they have because in a few

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,720
years

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
mitigate the risks that their bad habits

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
because you're going to go through a

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
digital process of some kind it doesn't

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,080
matter if your likes broken or if you're

176
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
buying a house or if you're going to pay

177
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,479
taxes or stay at a hotel so if you're

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,400
going to come visit norway make sure

179
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
that your data plan is in order

180
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
norwegian businesses is also very

181
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
digital

182
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,120
they do their banking their taxes their

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
reporting their their everything digital

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
this is not only like the big businesses

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,880
and the big industries it's also like

186
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
this one person plumber company

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,800
type of things

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,880
all of them are digital to some degree

189
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,680
that means that uh the maturity level of

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
security

191
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
between old different companies are very

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,800
very different like we have the ones

193
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
that are

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
really solid have security training

195
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,759
everybody is on board on routines and

196
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,000
all that but we also have a lot of the

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
middle ground

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,319
where

199
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,120
the i.t people is typically

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
good

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
but then there's the rest of the company

202
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,599
of course i do understand spending money

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,919
and time of mitigating risks in the

204
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,160
higher risk areas which is the ita

205
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,000
department often managed

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
um but you need to move at some point

207
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,599
you need to move

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,520
from that

209
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
hybrid situation between uh good

210
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
combined with very bad security into

211
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,240
like

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
everybody should be on board on having

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
like a good security culture in our

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
organization

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
uh and getting a grip of like on this

216
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,599
situation password manager is really a

217
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,240
good stat to do

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
it's very low threshold

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
it doesn't cost a lot by the way keep it

220
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,680
that way

221
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,760
it's it's easy

222
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,479
[Music]

223
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
but when rolling out um

224
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,839
password managers in a company

225
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,839
you're going to discover that there's a

226
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,919
mismatch between the amount of employees

227
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,120
that you have

228
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,000
and the people using it

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
sometimes it's closer sometimes it's

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
worse

231
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
of course it's not a surprise like the

232
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
tech savvy people

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
they will when you roll out the password

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
managers and said oh we're gonna start

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
paying for this um this is the tool that

236
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
you get to use some of them is gonna go

237
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
yes you choose the one that i that's

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
that's my favorite

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,839
there's gonna be like a small crowd of

240
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,959
those people

241
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
and then it's gonna be like uh

242
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,240
a early majority that's like okay fine

243
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
this is a neutral sounds like a good

244
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,600
idea i'm just gonna set it up because no

245
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
um then there's gonna be a huge amount

246
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
of people that is more like late

247
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
adopters they're like yeah i didn't get

248
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,480
i did get the email um

249
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
i didn't have the time at the time

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
but since you have sent me four five six

251
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
emails now maybe i should do this

252
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
then you're gonna have a lot of people

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
who don't

254
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
just they don't

255
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
now i don't have numbers for this

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
um

257
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,640
but

258
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
very often the non-users are in

259
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,800
administration

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
they are managers

261
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,320
or newly employees

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,839
also people who are suffering a life

263
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,680
crisis may also have very difficulty in

264
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
adopting new habits

265
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
and

266
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,839
starting using like password monitors

267
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
because it takes a lot of thinking

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,560
or some thinking

269
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
tech savvy people will set up a password

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
manager

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
enterprise solution

272
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
within 15 minutes

273
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,519
they'll do it before their lunch it's

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,360
not a problem

275
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
for non-technical users

276
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
the time they need to

277
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
allocate to start using a password

278
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,399
monitor is in my experience one hour

279
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,240
and a lot of people push like they avoid

280
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
starting because they're not sure how

281
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,279
long it's going to take they just know

282
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,920
it's going to take time

283
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
an hour

284
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,959
setting up means

285
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,320
installing it on more than one device

286
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,800
orientating yourself in what is this

287
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
software what does it do

288
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,279
try out how it's working discover some

289
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,600
features that you like or hate and

290
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
adding enough password for this to be a

291
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
useful tool

292
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
for companies um the success rate

293
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
for non-tech people

294
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
to start using password monitor is

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
very affected but how much time do they

296
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
have to get started

297
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,360
if they are squeezed on time

298
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,079
or if setting up a password manager

299
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
is competing with more rewarding tasks

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
also known as my job

301
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,160
they're not going to do it

302
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
a lot of companies

303
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
think or may think

304
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
um well that's okay we're just going to

305
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,839
order them

306
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,720
we're just going to tell them to do this

307
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,279
and we will write it into our company

308
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,639
policy

309
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,480
emails will be sent out reminders are

310
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,800
being sent sometimes everyone send out

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
threats

312
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
like if you don't do this this and this

313
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
can happen we'll cut your salary in some

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
way

315
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
and i understand that because

316
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
employers have the right to instruct

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,639
their employees

318
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
it's completely normal but if security

319
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,240
was that easy we could all go home

320
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,160
i wouldn't have a job

321
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
so what happens is that people when you

322
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,440
try to order someone to do something

323
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
that they don't want to do or have

324
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
conflicting feelings about is that they

325
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,920
may do the absolute minimum so they

326
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
don't get in trouble for instance so

327
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,959
they don't get their salary slashed

328
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,079
um

329
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,760
they will do the registration process

330
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,200
but it won't be using the software

331
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
and you end up in this like the non-tech

332
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
users or the non-users end up in a

333
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,639
hybrid situation where

334
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
you can see they have installed things

335
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,560
and they will

336
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
show up in your list as installed

337
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
but this there's no improvement of

338
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
security at all

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
so my first advice

340
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
make sure

341
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
everybody

342
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
has enough

343
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
paid

344
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
time

345
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
to set this up

346
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
at least an hour okay

347
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
moving on

348
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
you have to understand people don't like

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,560
managing not dealing with passwords

350
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
uh even

351
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,720
people like me in bed they're they're

352
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,800
they're conflicted feelings

353
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,399
uh there's a lot of some conscious

354
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,279
processes that go on in a human mind at

355
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,839
all times

356
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
um it's not impossible to manipulate

357
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
people into dealing with password

358
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
managers

359
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
but it's not ethical

360
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,959
it's incredibly disrespectful

361
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
and it may have unforeseen spillover

362
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
effects into other areas of life for

363
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
instance one of the reasons people hate

364
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
dealing with passwords is because they

365
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,360
feel that uh the rules around password

366
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
change all the time and

367
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,639
um

368
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
that it's difficult that is like

369
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
they have to remember things like

370
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,279
there's a lot of when we when we make

371
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,959
policies

372
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
it lasts

373
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
a long time in people's mind nothing

374
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,900
goes really away

375
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,760
[Music]

376
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
in addition

377
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
um when people feel trapped or forced

378
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
they tend to start behaving slightly

379
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
irrational

380
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
and reactive

381
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,360
they will do the opposite

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,839
of what you're telling them to do

383
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,560
or a version of opposite for instance if

384
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
i tell you do not hack the hotel while

385
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
you're here

386
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
i'm instructing you and what happens is

387
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
your beautiful minds were still like

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,519
well i'm not hacking the hotel

389
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,720
or i'm not hacking the ho you start

390
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
putting effort into

391
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
both sort of comply with what i said but

392
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
also

393
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
trying to defy me

394
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
and that is that is the magic of

395
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,480
instruction it's terrible

396
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,720
so when i do security training

397
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
uh we have to be very careful in how we

398
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
instruct people

399
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,079
if it feels

400
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,639
manipulative or forced

401
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
it's only human to react that way

402
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,000
the

403
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,199
ul the fire some way you insist of me

404
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,600
changing my password every other week

405
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
i'll defy that in some

406
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,160
way yeah

407
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,279
i like to talk with people and i like to

408
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,720
listen to people

409
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
i like to know what are their thoughts

410
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
and how do they feel

411
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
about

412
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
for instance password managers

413
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,600
my goal is to understand them better

414
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
so that i and you

415
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,360
can facilitate both the subconscious

416
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
decision that they're going to do all

417
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
the time that they're not aware of but

418
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
also

419
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,240
be respectful for the reasons that they

420
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
think they have

421
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,719
for doing things

422
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,839
people don't really understand

423
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
themselves well but but we still have to

424
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,759
be respectful towards them

425
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
and if you listen to the reason that

426
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,880
people give for not using password

427
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
manager you start to discover all these

428
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
irrational thought patterns that they

429
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,639
have

430
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,440
so

431
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,839
my challenge to you is

432
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,839
listen to them in the respectful no

433
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
sarcasm way

434
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
so that they can see their own

435
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,399
irrational thought patterns and we can

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
change and mitigate the risks associated

437
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,759
with them

438
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,079
for instance the first one

439
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,759
hands up if you ever heard the first one

440
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,160
only a few okay

441
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,680
and i say um

442
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,959
do you have a password manager and they

443
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,518
was like oh no no um i have a system

444
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,040
well

445
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,679
yeah now i can of course i can i can

446
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
prove why they're wrong why systems are

447
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,119
crap

448
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,319
but instead of

449
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
trying to like beat

450
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,480
common sense into them with my words i

451
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,319
just says that's okay you can have a

452
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,599
password manager even though you have a

453
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
system

454
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
and then interesting things start

455
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,959
happening

456
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,240
because that was sort of like their

457
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,599
mental block

458
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
like don't talk to me like this is my

459
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,200
way of rejection

460
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,039
or rejecting uh that huge

461
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,640
imaginary task that you've given me

462
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,919
another thing that people say is well

463
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,080
yes but i don't have access to anything

464
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,400
important and that one is real like when

465
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
i hear that it makes me sad because it

466
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,799
means that they don't think what they're

467
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,320
doing is important

468
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
that's terrible

469
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,039
why would we hire them and pay them if

470
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,760
they're

471
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,160
if they wasn't important

472
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
so i tell them well

473
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
i think you're important and the things

474
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
that you do are very important and you

475
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
have access to a lot of things that are

476
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,280
important please listen to me i work in

477
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,799
security i should know

478
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,559
and then again interesting things can

479
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,879
happen

480
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,799
uh i started but something happened

481
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
i like that one

482
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,600
um

483
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,840
because it's it's very easy

484
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
it's usually a technical problem

485
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
so i said just now oh let me look at

486
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
that with

487
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,919
you

488
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,000
so we can resolve that

489
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,799
with

490
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,840
you

491
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,200
not let me do that for you

492
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,080
uh the i used it but then

493
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,120
is harder because that means

494
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,360
is a technical issue

495
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,760
but they have lost faith

496
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,919
in the product and the tool

497
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
so i have to re like motivate them again

498
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,120
before i can solve their technical

499
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,880
issues like it's worth the time it takes

500
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,679
to learn this thing

501
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,559
um

502
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,640
the one it doesn't really work well with

503
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,039
things that can happen

504
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,039
a lot of the time that means that the

505
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,120
password input prompt happens in the

506
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
wrong type of fields we can't

507
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,679
necessarily fix it it's a

508
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,440
whole long thing i can't fix it now

509
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
um

510
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,679
so

511
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,039
when that happens i would just have to

512
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,640
remote to them and say oh that's normal

513
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
but you'll be fine you can deal with

514
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
that

515
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,480
you can do this anyway like you're okay

516
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,600
um

517
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
and they um

518
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,600
um

519
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
i have it

520
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
uh but i can't really understand what

521
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,400
happened that's also a technical issue

522
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,360
like

523
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,720
typically in the first part of the

524
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
process when they're signing on

525
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,039
something got messed up and they're

526
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,320
stuck

527
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,799
it's like okay

528
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,120
let me look at that with

529
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,158
you so that we can figure it out

530
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
and the last one oh i have it but i

531
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,158
don't really use it

532
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,000
um

533
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
that is um

534
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,919
human speech for

535
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,640
it's boring

536
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,600
i don't see a value to this

537
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
hang on sorry i just need my cursor on

538
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
the right screen

539
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,400
well what do i

540
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,840
what can i do about it's being

541
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,440
boring well yeah it's boring it's super

542
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,240
boring adding a bunch of passwords

543
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
so um

544
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,799
you know what grab a bottle of wine and

545
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
some friends and set it up you know

546
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
adding password is boring but you're

547
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
going to do it anyway it's good for you

548
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,080
anyway

549
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,760
do a password and prosecco

550
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
so

551
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
conversations like these are delicate

552
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,720
but you do

553
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
if you get that moment where you catch

554
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,159
their interest

555
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
acknowledge their feelings

556
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
so that you can change their mind like

557
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,240
you can expand that little gap that you

558
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
get

559
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,159
if you mess it up by either

560
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
like not acknowledging the feelings or

561
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
if you uh says oh yeah but you have to

562
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,760
wait forever ever and ever to have this

563
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,080
result or yeah we're gonna send somebody

564
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
who's not gonna be able to fix that but

565
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,720
sort of like helping you you're going to

566
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
cement that feeling that they have that

567
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
this thing this thing is not something i

568
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,520
want in my life

569
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
learning to use a password manager

570
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,360
is

571
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
learning

572
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
and a lot of the time we think that okay

573
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
but you can just learn it no you can't

574
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
you have to

575
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,559
make

576
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
your mind ready for learning the first

577
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,400
step is

578
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,039
feeling safe if you're afraid

579
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,400
of losing your job

580
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
while you do something you're not going

581
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
to learn well or at all

582
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
you're going to spend all your energy

583
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
on trying to get out of this situation

584
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
and avoid losing your job

585
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,719
that's not the learning that we want

586
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,360
now this is purely speculative from my

587
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
side but i don't have the numbers for

588
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
this but my general impression when it

589
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
comes to issues of the non-users

590
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
a lot of the managers

591
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
have this problem

592
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
they think they should be able to do

593
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,440
this

594
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,039
um

595
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,240
but

596
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,960
you know they worry so much

597
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,120
they worry about failing because they're

598
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,799
well they're a manager one they're

599
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,320
supposed to be like

600
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,039
the best or better than older people

601
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,799
there's a lot of worrying happening

602
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
so

603
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,400
but you need to get your managers on

604
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
board

605
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,919
like it's tempting to ignore that the

606
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,640
managers are not using password monitors

607
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,919
but if you do you're going to fail

608
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,039
managers influence and has a lot to say

609
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,760
about how you prioritize your time

610
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
if the managers is not on board

611
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
they cannot help their team they cannot

612
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
help with recovery which is a big part

613
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,799
of an enterprise solution

614
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,360
they are not pushing password managers

615
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
to new hires

616
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
and they do not show that this is a

617
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
valuable thing

618
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
to spend time on

619
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,120
and if they don't show that

620
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,640
you're not going to do that you're going

621
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,440
to do

622
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
your job

623
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,400
instead

624
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
okay

625
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
that's my second advice get the manager

626
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,399
award

627
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,320
yes

628
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
uh after making sure that people feel

629
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,720
safe like there's room for mistakes and

630
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,000
so on uh people need to feel that this

631
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
is something they can actually manage to

632
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,559
do

633
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
and especially the non-tech like the

634
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,039
administrative people

635
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,440
they need to feel that this is something

636
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
that

637
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
within their reach of like managing to

638
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
do

639
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
um so when they ask for help or they're

640
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
open to get help

641
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,600
i will set it up for them while they're

642
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,039
with me

643
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,480
and then i

644
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,279
tell them to add the passwords

645
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,520
and when they've added a few passwords

646
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,080
i say um and now you do this and this to

647
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
set up the next device

648
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
i don't go from i set up the first

649
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,960
device and now you're going to set up

650
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
the next device that's too big of a step

651
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
you need to feel that you can accomplish

652
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
something in between

653
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
and adding the passwords are really

654
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
really easy

655
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,200
just yeah gentle caring attention and i

656
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,559
you can do this

657
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
you'll be fine

658
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
a million years ago

659
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
when the dinosaurs were young and roamed

660
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,640
the earth

661
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,799
a man i know was a manager this is not

662
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,880
the mana that was a manager you were not

663
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
a manager

664
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,880
um there was actually somebody else who

665
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
was who is also a dinosaur

666
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,640
email

667
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,600
wasn't something new

668
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,080
but

669
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,480
not everybody was using it

670
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,640
and this organization recognized that

671
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,360
had a problem they are using email to

672
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,440
communicate internally in the

673
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760
organization it's a good efficient tool

674
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
but so many were not using email they

675
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
were not plugging on

676
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,320
and

677
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,159
the problem was that so they didn't get

678
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
the information that's the first problem

679
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,159
and the second problem is that they

680
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,919
consumed a huge amount of support time

681
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,320
because they logged on so really they

682
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
forgot how to do it in between all the

683
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,159
times

684
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,240
so this manager

685
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
thought about it for a while

686
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
uh and it was getting close to summer

687
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,919
and in the summer they had a freezer

688
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
and in that freezer there was ice cream

689
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,559
that you can buy

690
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,919
so he sent out an email to everyone

691
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,960
blind carbon copy not carbon copy so it

692
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,440
looks like it comes to you personally

693
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,080
and he said you can go and have an ice

694
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
cream for free if you want just reply to

695
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,080
the email and say that you took one so i

696
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,600
can keep track of it

697
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,520
the important thing is

698
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,960
do not tell

699
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,520
anyone

700
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,360
of course they told anyone

701
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,880
first rule of fight club don't talk

702
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
about fight club

703
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,039
they told

704
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,640
they were gossiping

705
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,000
did you know you can get ice cream if

706
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,640
you read your email once in a while

707
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
so what happened was that people who

708
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
didn't like to read their email because

709
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,720
they find it difficult were now like

710
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
maybe i should check them up on my email

711
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,880
because i might get a free ice cream

712
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,080
you can do this with password managers

713
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
i highly recommend

714
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,360
adding first of all the password for the

715
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,399
wi-fi

716
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,919
into the password manager in your

717
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
company so whenever people are asking

718
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,480
uh what's the password for the guest

719
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
network or whatever you say look in the

720
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
vault

721
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,840
if you have

722
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,399
um

723
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
if you have like discounts or agreements

724
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,480
or

725
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
some kind discount codes or other kind

726
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,960
of services that are nice add them as

727
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,399
well

728
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
and then it becomes like the people who

729
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,480
are using password managers they get

730
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
extra perks

731
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
you can have them as well we're not in

732
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
our key there's no like

733
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
in an out group you can get it you just

734
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
need to set up a password manager if you

735
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
need help you can just talk to that

736
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
person

737
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,360
be fine

738
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,880
you can also do this by with your

739
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
parents

740
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
guess what i'm telling my mom every time

741
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
she asks what's the weavey password

742
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
again

743
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
look in the vault mom you just need use

744
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
your thumb to log in

745
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
so yeah

746
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,840
this is how i build

747
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,039
culture

748
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,320
not ordering people this is culture

749
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,440
yeah

750
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
you made your users feel safe you made

751
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,279
the humans feel like they can master

752
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,399
this now they're ready for learning

753
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,199
what are you gonna teach them

754
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
this is this text is in norwegian

755
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,559
it says

756
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
do you want to forget

757
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,918
all your passwords this summer

758
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,840
second line is get help with setting up

759
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,919
your password manager at the 24th of

760
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,960
june in the cantina 12 to 15. uh this is

761
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,880
a drop-in situation you can just drop in

762
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
it's very casual not dangerous at all

763
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,039
um

764
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,799
i had their christian cowick who's

765
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,880
sitting over there my colleague he

766
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
helped me out with this and the results

767
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,200
were really fun

768
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
because people were coming in and they

769
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
were like

770
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
like you know the shameful pose that is

771
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,720
will will i get hurt by doing like

772
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
coming here and confessing that i hadn't

773
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
set up my password manager a year ago

774
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,559
like i should or something

775
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,840
and i was like no judging here i'm only

776
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,399
here to help you

777
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
i'm not being sarcastic there's no

778
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,679
judgment

779
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
and what happened was that afterwards

780
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,399
people were like

781
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,279
they feel relieved they were rid of the

782
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,720
anxious guilty feelings they were happy

783
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,480
so guess what happened

784
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,360
they told people

785
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,840
so now we have a lot of non-technical

786
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,439
security advocates in our organization

787
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,799
that is winning that is really winning

788
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,799
it's fantastic because usually security

789
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
is like the i.t people is doing that uh

790
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,320
and if we're gonna deal with that it's

791
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,399
because we like them and do them a favor

792
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,799
by dealing with security so yeah

793
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,960
but now we have the non-technical people

794
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
and it's like

795
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,080
you can talk to her she's really nice

796
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
she will just help you and stuff

797
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,000
so yeah

798
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,720
to sum it up

799
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,279
it is normal that not everybody is ready

800
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,000
to use your tool

801
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
people can change their mind about

802
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,600
password managers

803
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
even if you didn't get like catch them

804
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,080
the first time around there's hope

805
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
but you need to be ready

806
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
for when that possibility present itself

807
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,320
or you need to facilitate that that

808
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,000
happens like

809
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,039
uh we did with the summer

810
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,880
promise of you're allowed to forget all

811
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
your passwords

812
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,919
uh and also make sure that you

813
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,480
facilitate growth and learning in

814
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
general

815
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
because when they're done learning about

816
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
password managers

817
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,039
they're going to be ready to learn about

818
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,200
other security stuff

819
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
and then you can be like what do i want

820
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,760
to teach them next

821
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,320
it's awesome

822
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,720
yeah

823
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,799
questions

824
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,279
thank you cecilia

825
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,320

thank you for the presentation uh have a

829
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
question in the context of a larger

830
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
company

831
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,679
do you have tips about teaching

832
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,159
developers and the id people to actually

833
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,600
implement

834
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,360
like sso 2fa so that the burden of

835
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,120
having to do things and manage security

836
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,799
properly is not on the user side but

837
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,159
more on the

838
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,120
actually having a safe services and

839
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
users just having to remember one

840
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,399
password and this kind of stuff

841
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,480
i do uh and that's security training in

842
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,880
general yeah just okay so security

843
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,840
training

844
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
you have to start like really

845
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
low bar like what is the absolute

846
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,159
minimum that we need them to know and

847
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,480
start with training that first

848
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,799
and then it's like okay what is relevant

849
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,120
for your position don't do gen like

850
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,000
don't teach everybody the same thing

851
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,840
is it relevant for this person's

852
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,000
position yes or no if it's not don't

853
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,720
don't spend don't insist on they going

854
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
through all these like security

855
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,960
training things if it's not relevant and

856
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
if it's relevant

857
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,320
let people

858
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
like do it as a group thing

859
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,519
um

860
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,519
if you can um do it physically

861
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
it's much easier to learn things

862
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
uh and feel safe

863
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
when you can see that there's no danger

864
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
you can see people's faces they're like

865
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
they're relaxed they're okay i can ask

866
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
them questions

867
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,600
i'll be fine

868
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,760
um

869
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,360
but but

870
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,240
don't expect that mfa or all the other

871
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
things is gonna happen like they

872
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,679
probably learn in school no they didn't

873
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,519
make sure that they are onboarded

874
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,279
properly like

875
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,679
and also this is one of my best tricks

876
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,799
ever

877
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,720
feed them

878
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,000
hungry people don't learn

879
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
so do onboarding with food give them

880
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,600
time and be nice

881
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,279
you can teach them anything really

882
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,720
thanks for your talk um

883
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,480
on the subject of

884
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,200
feeling safe using a password manager

885
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,399
how do you counter the

886
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,000
impression that people have when they're

887
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,760
told by their i.t department that they

888
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,000
should be using a password manager that

889
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,080
the i.t department has some sort of an

890
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
evil motive around that like oh they

891
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
want to get old i they know that i'm

892
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
going to store my bank password in there

893
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,918
and they want to get to my bank account

894
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,079
or something like that how do you how do

895
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,000
you deal with that impression

896
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
uh first of all um

897
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,560
doesn't matter what the question

898
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,480
when you meet the user if they have a

899
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
question or a concern

900
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,480
take them serious again they're gonna

901
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,520
have like

902
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,119
subconscious uh

903
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,040
it's mostly about their feelings they're

904
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
just worried

905
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,399
so just take them serious

906
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,599
um

907
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,440
show them if they want to

908
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,719
uh

909
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,879
use some time

910
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,760
because

911
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,918
if you reassure them like spend time on

912
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:44,800
them

913
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,440
i acknowledge that you're worried uh is

914
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,839
there anything i can do to help you

915
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,520
understand this better or easier worries

916
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,000
and then you have a conversation like

917
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
do that in the beginning whenever you're

918
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,800
going to do changes to your culture

919
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,240
in the beginning it's going to be a lot

920
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
of noise

921
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,520
but

922
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,920
after a while when all the other people

923
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,000
are starting to use this it's going to

924
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,599
feel safer

925
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,280
but in the beginning it's going to be

926
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,520
noisy and a lot of insecurity going on

927
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,960
this is why it's very important to have

928
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,800
the managers on board if the managers

929
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
use it

930
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,079
probably safe enough for me as well

931
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,359
hi

932
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,760
i think we all know

933
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
i think we know all these uh shared

934
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,000
accounts for third-party services

935
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
that are used across the department

936
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,200
uh

937
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
do those type of accounts make

938
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,359
transition easier because everybody

939
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
needs to use the server the password

940
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,839
manager at the same time when the

941
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,599
password changes or do you think this

942
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,119
prevents people from moving because it's

943
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,160
more scary and harder to implement

944
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,599
i'm not sure if i heard all of your

945
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,160
question but i'm good i think you asked

946
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,640
uh what about shared accounts is it

947
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,880
easier and safer or is going to feel

948
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
more dangerous because then it's

949
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,480
apparent that we're sharing things

950
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
you in

951
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,839
most organizations you need to share

952
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,320
passwords that's just the way it is

953
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,400
if you do it with within the password

954
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,440
manager this is a fantastic trick

955
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,359
if you do it within the password manager

956
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,280
if i change the password

957
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,680
he won't notice because he's so used to

958
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,599
just getting like copying the password

959
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,960
out of the password manager he's not

960
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,240
going to notice that i changed the

961
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,040
password as long as it works

962
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,400
and this is one of the things that we

963
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
don't talk about a lot in businesses and

964
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,880
that is unfaithful servants

965
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,040
or people who has to leave the company

966
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
uh in disgrace

967
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,119
we need to change those passwords

968
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,599
discreetly because the case may not be

969
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,160
settled it may it may be a lot of

970
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
difficulties around it like legal

971
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
difficulties so being able to change

972
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,320
passwords discreetly is actually very

973
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,880
important

974
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
hi cecile thanks for the talk

975
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,119
my question is about those

976
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,920
old it guys who will not

977
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
share the

978
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,760
root password for all of the like cisco

979
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,960
routers and the guy who will not share

980
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,079
the password for the special safe

981
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,920
that we keep the special stuff in like

982
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,000
that guy right because he knows if he

983
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,079
shares that password yeah we might not

984
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,359
need him anymore you know

985
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,359
are you telling me they're humans

986
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,079
yes with their their fears and

987
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,640
feed them

988
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,119
i promise you

989
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,520
if you're gonna ask something big

990
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,960
this is social engineering if you're

991
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,680
gonna ask something big or uncomfortable

992
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
from someone

993
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,160
make sure they have a like

994
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,599
medium plus blood sugar levels

995
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,520
so because then they're more patient

996
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,079
with listening to you and your reasons

997
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,200
because

998
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,880
you may or may not have good reasons for

999
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,800
getting that password

1000
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,720
but you may not get the time to explain

1001
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,640
why you really need that why they should

1002
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,920
trust you because they're hungry

1003
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,240
but me and jim would really like to have

1004
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,030
a chat with you outside afterwards

1005
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,820
[Laughter]

1006
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
i'm not sure if i should do this on

1007
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,920
camera um

1008
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
but my uh

1009
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,320
a few few others my colleagues know if i

1010
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
show up at work with cake

1011
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,480
somebody's in trouble

1012
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
it's not because i'm going to be rude or

1013
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,000
horrible to them

1014
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,160
it's just that i need them to be able to

1015
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,960
be open to my

1016
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,160
what i'm going to tell them that it's

1017
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,400
going to be demanding that's going to

1018
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,760
mess with their feelings a bit they're

1019
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,280
going to feel bad

1020
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,680
cake helps

1021
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,359
good trick more questions

1022
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,960
so i'm in the compliance and audit space

1023
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,000
and the shared passwords is always a

1024
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
contention point around maintaining a

1025
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,079
security controls

1026
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,280
um how do you deal with knowing who

1027
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
accessed the password and did uh

1028
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,280
like did a bad uh made a mistake and how

1029
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
how would we audit that

1030
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,200
you should definitely talk to one

1031
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
password and lastpass because there are

1032
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,960
two companies that do enterprise and

1033
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,560
give them to tell you how did you do

1034
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,079
that because they have functionality for

1035
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,680
that but since they're not paying me

1036
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,040
you'll have to talk to their sales

1037
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,000
people now do we have time like two and

1038
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,599
a half minutes

1039
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,200
good i want to show you something

1040
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,119
because this is um this is my bonus

1041
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,480
slide for you

1042
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,160
uh

1043
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,640
life changes and when life changes

1044
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,118
people re-evaluate what's going on

1045
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,599
and here are some life-changing events

1046
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,960
these are events that usually trigger

1047
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,560
large changes in behavior

1048
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,880
getting married

1049
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
new romantic relationships like if you

1050
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
meet someone or your employees meet

1051
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,359
somebody they fall in love they're going

1052
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,800
to start thinking

1053
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,359
should i share my netflix with them

1054
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,760
and so on like what is the

1055
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
sensible level of

1056
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,520
sharing that we want to do and so on so

1057
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,079
they start reevaluating their life then

1058
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,240
they're open to you know what it's

1059
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
really useful to have a password manager

1060
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,440
in that situation oh in our program you

1061
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,960
can get one free for your girlfriend or

1062
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,440
boyfriend

1063
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,400
kids when people

1064
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,280
have kids they do the same they realize

1065
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,000
the world can be a dangerous place and

1066
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,640
imagine teenagers

1067
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,800
wouldn't it be awesome if your teenagers

1068
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,040
had a password manager so they don't get

1069
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,839
hacked

1070
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,400
imagine how many passwords that teenager

1071
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,880
is gonna like has in front of them for

1072
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,960
the rest of their lives

1073
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
we're talking

1074
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
hundreds of passwords wouldn't it be a

1075
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,599
good habit to teach your teenager

1076
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,440
and then you can teach them about mfa

1077
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,200
later on because it's a super easy thing

1078
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
to have when you already have a password

1079
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,880
manager

1080
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,720
life-threatening disease or sudden death

1081
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720

1082
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,040

1083
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040

1084
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
head is

1085
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280

1086
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,440

1087
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,000

divorce happen and divorce is one of the

1097
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,800
most common reasons why people

1098
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,480
send me a message like

1099
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,720
