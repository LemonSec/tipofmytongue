1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,899

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,140
these sides welcome to uh pastorscom I'm

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,240
pet you can just refer to me as the

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,759
crazy password guy I've been doing this

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
now since the first time was in December

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,100
2010 in my hometown in Bergen of Norway

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,400
how high up north in in Europe

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,939
uh anyone here that is participating at

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,680
pastorscom for the very first time raise

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,599
your hand

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,019
oh wow awesome

12
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:36,239
cool okay so I have a serious uh

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
interest in this stuff a very healthy uh

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,800
or unhealthy curiosity into passwords

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,620
um my interest in passwords came about

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,079
approximately 23 years ago I was doing

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,559
pen testing as a consultant at PWC

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
and during one engagement against the

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,360
Fortune 500 company we

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,219
pulled out from a Windows domain

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,379
controller we pull out tens of thousands

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,120
of usernames

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,159
and then we used an incredibly simple

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,860
script to try out two different

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,860
passwords against all accounts

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,840
the first password was the name of the

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,820
company and the second password was just

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,539
password

29
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,140
and blind luck but after um running the

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,939
scripts for some time we did find some

31
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,460
people that were just you know normal

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,619
users and they'll be using the company

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,720
name as the password

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,939
but suddenly we also see on screen that

35
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,799
there's an account which is using

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,060
password

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,820
as the password for the account

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
and we look up the count and we see that

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,200
that account is actually a member of the

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,380
domain administrators group

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,479
and this was on day one of our

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,720
assignment for Fortune 500 company

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,820
and we were three guys in the room and

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,100
we took like three steps back and like

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,920
okay guys so this is the moment we've

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,200
been waiting for do you want to become a

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,140
criminal and move to the Bahamas

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,060
or we should be just invoice the client

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,639
to say got you

50
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,919
and here I am so obviously I'm not rich

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,500
I'm not living in the Bahamas

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,360
that started my Fascination for

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,680
passwords

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,980
and passwordscon came about in 2010

55
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,340
I was invited to do uh attend a one-week

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,239
workshop for phds and professors high up

57
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,920
north in Norway

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,200
and they asked me if I could do a rump

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
session on passwords never been to

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,900
University so I just had I just heard

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,480
can you do a talk

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,459
I didn't know what the ramp session was

63
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,019
supposed to be

64
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,700
so I came there and I saw the program

65
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,739
that I was not listed

66
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,680
I had of course created a talk for them

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,319
put a lot of info I thought into it

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
and in evening I was asked can you start

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,739
at nine o'clock in the evening after

70
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,360
dinner and I was like sure not a problem

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
at all

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,599
and I started nine and I finished at

73
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,640
approximately 11 o'clock so two hours

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
that's a very very short introduction to

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,260
the topic of passwords

76
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,080
lots of questions lots of applause

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
and then they came up to me like uh you

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,680
know a ramp session is supposed to be

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,260
five minute stops

80
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,180
so there are some PhD students that are

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,319
a little pissed at you now because

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,060
they've been waiting for quite some time

83
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,920
they have also prepare some prepared

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,080
some talks they allowed to they will

85
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,519
have to do it tomorrow

86
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,500
and he came back to me this professor in

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,940
Norway and said hey I've got some money

88
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,340
I got a budget and I have a room so if

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,480
you would like to do a conference about

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
passwords we can do that so we did the

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,620
very first one in December 2010 in

92
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,720
Bergen

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm also sad to say that a good friend

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,840
of mine Jeremy Gosney in Texas he is one

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,360
of those who have been running passwords

96
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,340
com here while I've been away for the

97
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,680
past six years because of one president

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
and one Global pandemic

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,459
uh he couldn't make it this year

100
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,580
unfortunately uh but again Jeremy

101
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,860
really big thank you for while I'm

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,260
waving to the camera a really big thank

103
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,599
you for actually helping me to come to

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,360
Las Vegas I had no idea this could be

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,819
done back in 2013 when we did the first

106
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,760
passagecon here in Vegas

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,358
now again I'm obsessed with passwords

108
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,279
I'm going to talk about password surveys

109
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,220
and just to prove my obsession this is a

110
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,320
tweet I mean you can probably guess what

111
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,780
my car license plate says it's in

112
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,139
Norwegian but you know you probably get

113
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,100
it

114
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,380
and this is me tweeting out on Twitter

115
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,540
that I have it probably from coma curly

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,940
he's a famous researcher with Microsoft

117
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,960
research

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,060
with a witness present that his interest

119
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,000
in passwords well I'm obsessed with it

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,160
comac please confirm statement and

121
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,259
Cormac responds in public on Twitter

122
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,540
saying confirm I have a healthy

123
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,460
curiosity while 2 SIM is pathologically

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,900
obsessed

125
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,740
and I am very proud of this tweet from

126
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,080
coma curly

127
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,479
so there we are better again background

128
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,660
and context for this short talk

129
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,479
um you know with my obsession I take no

130
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,580
interest in costs or alcohol or Sports

131
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,759
even uh I do password spins digital

132
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,160
authentication all the time

133
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,400
and I have seen so many

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
shitty password surveys all over the

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,139
world nope not mentioning nor VPN or

136
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,759
anyone else

137
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,520
but I don't trust those password servers

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,580
I don't trust them at all and it's not

139
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,759
like you know I'm trying to be a nasty

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,380
here against the people or the companies

141
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,840
that are doing this surveys I just don't

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,580
believe that they know enough about the

143
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,000
topic to ask the correct questions the

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,280
correct way in the correct order and I

145
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,020
don't think that the majority of people

146
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,600
responding to these surveys actually

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
understand the questions they are about

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,280
to answer that's what I want to talk

149
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,000
about so this is a very easy talk so to

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,259
say

151
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,840
and what I want you to do now you can

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,319
use your phone or pen and paper

153
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,000
and there's no online form so just type

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
this down for your cell phone you can

155
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,080
just do it in inside your head

156
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,979
but I will give you 10 seconds

157
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,699
to think about the following question

158
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,340
how many passwords do you have

159
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,840
10 9 8 7.

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,639
6

161
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,300
5

162
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,639
four three

163
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,020
two

164
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,940
one

165
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,500
so random person in the audience Jeff

166
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,800
how many passwords do you have

167
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,860
upwards of 700 he says

168
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,199
I don't know what you

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
came up with in your head but just

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,940
remember that number now for now

171
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,419
okay next question 10 10 seconds to

172
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,340
think about the next one

173
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,539
how many

174
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,219
different passwords do you have

175
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,520
six five

176
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,660
four

177
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,039
three

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,180
two

179
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,979
one

180
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,900
okay

181
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,099
next question 10 seconds

182
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,539
how many accounts do you have

183
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,960
six

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,560
five four three

185
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,819
two

186
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,220
one

187
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,580
okay last one

188
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,400
did you count all accounts into those

189
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,039
numbers or are you basically just

190
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,039
counting accounts that you actively use

191
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,379
my point about these questions is I

192
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,199
bring them with with me anywhere I go if

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,180
I go to a party I will crash the party

194
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,759
asking password questions

195
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,419
if I go to a cafe I will just approach

196
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,879
random people and you don't do that in

197
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,039
Norway but I do

198
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,039
and I say hey I'm a crazy password guy

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm doing a survey about passwords I

200
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,720
have some questions for you

201
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,460
I can assure you there's a lot of people

202
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,759
who looks at me when I do that

203
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,560
and I asked this and I'm really not

204
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,020
interested in the answers to the

205
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,599
questions I'm interested in how do you

206
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,419
interpret my question what am I actually

207
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,860
asking about

208
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,019
because when you ask how many passwords

209
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,200
do you have am I asking how many unique

210
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,019
passwords do you have or am I asking how

211
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,779
many accounts do I have because my

212
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,540
experience is some people think that the

213
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,100
first question is about how many

214
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
accounts do I have some people they

215
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,160
consider this as passwords but you

216
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,260
didn't unbox them ask about how many

217
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,000
horse races do I have as an example

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,920
and how many accounts do you have as

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,620
well people tend to count the accounts

220
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,080
they are actually using on a sort of

221
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,480
like everyday or at least weekly or

222
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,980
monthly basis

223
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,500
but if you ask the question how many

224
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,100
accounts do you think you have that you

225
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,620
have ever created that are most probably

226
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,779
not deleted yet

227
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,180
because that number is going to be

228
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,140
a lot higher

229
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,140
so the question also is how many

230
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,839
accounts in active use do you have and

231
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,399
of course you can make a note of this as

232
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,560
well because that is going to be a

233
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,839
pretty small number compared to the

234
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,060
total amount of counts that you have

235
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,160
and also regarding

236
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,620
all these accounts that you have

237
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
when they counted the number of accounts

238
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,779
did you also include customer loyalty

239
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,420
programs that actually provides an

240
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,820
account for you where you can log in but

241
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,640
you don't need that now I don't know how

242
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,860
you do customer loyalty programs in the

243
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,300
US

244
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,700
but in Norway I can go to a lot of

245
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,160
different shops for clothing for shoes

246
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,860
for you know electrical tools for my

247
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,620
home or whatever gardening stuff and

248
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,060
they will ask you are you a member with

249
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,180
us no would you like to be a member no

250
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,420
hell no well you get a 10 discount oh

251
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,760
hell yes I will

252
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,100
and in Norway they would just ask you

253
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,140
your phone number because in Norway your

254
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,240
phone number is to us it's public

255
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,640
information for almost everyone

256
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,620
and then they will set up an account for

257
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,060
me they will probably send me a text

258
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,880
message to confirm my account

259
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,820
but in most cases at least in my

260
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,800
experience people have never looked

261
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,019
logged in to their Customer Loyalty

262
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,000
account with the you know clothing

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,220
retailer whatever it is where you can

264
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,600
see what kind of clothing have you been

265
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,519
purchasing over the past two years what

266
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,019
kind of groceries have you been

267
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,540
purchasing and so on but those are also

268
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,800
accounts

269
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,540
and in those accounts you can find

270
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,000
interesting information about people in

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,060
some cases stuff that your spouse is not

272
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,000
supposed to see or maybe your kids

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,620
shouldn't see them or you shouldn't see

274
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,579
the

275
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,040
well things that kids can buy in a

276
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,140
grocery store or teenagers as an example

277
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,519
I have a teenage children myself

278
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm also interested in in the number of

279
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,160
accounts did you include accounts that

280
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
you use at work and do you consider work

281
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,880
as one account or do you have 5 or 10 or

282
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,720
50 different systems for payroll for you

283
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,360
know submitting working hours or for

284
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,720
logging into your database or

285
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,060
anything else like that

286
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,100
did you include include all those

287
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,579
accounts into your account of number of

288
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,380
accounts that you have and passwords

289
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,000
and the question how many customer

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,860
loyalty programs are you actually a

291
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,940
member of

292
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,880
I still have yet to meet almost anyone

293
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,480
in Norway who says anything else but I

294
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,660
have absolutely no [ __ ] clue

295
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,899
people in Norway no idea how many

296
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,000
membership loyalty programs they are a

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,959
member of

298
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,180
which is to me a little bit you know

299
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,180
discomforting

300
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,660
and also when you don't know how many of

301
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,220
these customer loyalty programs you are

302
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,240
a member of

303
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
then asking how many of these have you

304
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,860
ever logged into just to see

305
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,860
do they have two-factation available

306
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,360
what kind of information do they

307
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,579
actually keep track on about me

308
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,800
well people are clueless about that as

309
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,639
well

310
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,980
that could be a security problem that is

311
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,860
most definitely also a privacy problem

312
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,000
to a lot of people

313
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,639
moving on on these summer questions that

314
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
you need to answer here now

315
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,700
but asking people did you include pins

316
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,820
in your account or passwords

317
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,040
Jim looking at you you know memorable

318
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,820
Secrets is sort of uh the official nist

319
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,360
expression to use a memorable uh

320
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,980
Secret

321
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,620
because to Norwegians at least a pin

322
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,740
code has nothing to do with a password

323
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,980
those are completely different things

324
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,160
so I have yet to find a single Norwegian

325
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,620
more or less that have counted their

326
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,579
pins as or considered a pins as a

327
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,699
password

328
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,019
so they don't include that in the count

329
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,660
and I asked them well so how many pins

330
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,279
do you have

331
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,720
again most usually people are clueless

332
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,899
and it's also fun to ask them of the

333
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,060
different pins that you have

334
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,120
how many of them were given to you and

335
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
how many did you actually

336
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,760
create yourselves four digits three five

337
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,160
six or whatever you have

338
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,800
in Norway if you ask people what is a

339
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,220
pin they will say four numbers

340
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,260
and if you ask them well could a pin be

341
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,920
six numbers

342
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,279
uh yeah on my iPhone

343
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,040
but other than that in Norway it's PIN

344
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
codes in Norway there are four digits

345
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,820
everywhere for everything

346
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,279
and I'm fascinated about the fact that

347
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,139
you know if there's a place where I'm

348
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,420
required to use a pin not a password

349
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,240
I can't select anything else

350
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,820
than a four digit PIN there's no option

351
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,100
for doing something else

352
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,019
and we have incredibly good statistics

353
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,240
on usual selection and four digit pins

354
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,699
it is that easy to guess in most cases

355
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,220
and also since I'm turning 51 years old

356
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,380
in September I actually do have an email

357
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,300
account and I'm actually actively using

358
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,820
I have several email accounts

359
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,740
but asking people how many email

360
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,360
accounts do you have most people they

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,100
will say well I don't want to work and

362
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,899
I've got one private one

363
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,000
and if I asked my daughter she's 50 and

364
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
a half years old

365
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,959
she has two email accounts one at school

366
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,139
and one for personal use

367
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,000
the email address at school is being

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
used for homework

369
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,899
and a personal account

370
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,560
is only ever used for registering with

371
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,000
new services

372
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,300
nothing else my daughter never sends

373
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,759
emails to anyone if anyone sends her

374
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,339
email you will not get an answer if I

375
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,220
send her an email she won't even see it

376
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,360
that's how it is

377
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,839
I've been also also asking people do you

378
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,579
know what the passphrase is

379
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,199
did you know you can use space in

380
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,820
passwords most people still don't know

381
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,320
that

382
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,940
do you know what you've had on vacation

383
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
let's do two-step verification or

384
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,560
multiplication is there's no point in

385
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,959
asking people about that because they

386
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
don't care and they don't want to learn

387
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,860
just make it easy

388
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,079
and also asking do you use two-fact

389
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,459
multiplication

390
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,359
pointless

391
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,040
so my point here to get closer to the

392
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,079
ending of this

393
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,720
my key question is

394
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
if I give you 24 hours to generate a

395
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,560
list of all accounts passwords and pins

396
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,699
you've got

397
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,040
how much do you think your answers in

398
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,839
this survey will change

399
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,240
so go back to the initial question of

400
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,240
how many passwords how many unique

401
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
passwords how many accounts do you have

402
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,160
if I give you 24 hours

403
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,620
do you think you will stay at the same

404
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,720
number will you double the number will

405
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,519
you triple it

406
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,380
my experience

407
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,259
with those people have actually

408
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,259
done as I've told them to do try to make

409
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,459
that list

410
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,100
I see that on an average the list will

411
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,279
increase by three to five times

412
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,919
typically they will say well I got 20 30

413
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,439
accounts they end up

414
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,720
100 or more

415
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,579
so from a security and privacy

416
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,339
perspective I think that survey password

417
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,740
service oh [ __ ]

418
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,720
and to the extent they are showing that

419
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,939
we have a problem

420
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,280
they should actually show us we have a

421
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,839
very [ __ ] serious problem

422
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,660
so in summary I do not trust password

423
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,000
surveys at all

424
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,179
this has nothing to do with any specific

425
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,640
company or organization or anything

426
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,980
but it's just the way we ask the

427
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,200
questions and how people interpret what

428
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,299
they are being asked about

429
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,640
I really want to know for this surveys I

430
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,900
really want to know the questions that

431
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,360
have been asked I'm also interested to

432
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
learn how they were asked like was it

433
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,460
was this a phone interview was this done

434
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,580
online was this done in person like this

435
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,179
is is it through one-on-one interviews

436
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,700
and I would also like to know about the

437
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,780
questions asked by the respondents uh

438
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,520
you know did they understand it I want

439
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,140
to learn how did they interpret the

440
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,299
question being asked

441
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,840
and last but not least my point of this

442
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,260
I would really like to try to generate a

443
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,059
standard set of questions

444
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,039
that can either be the start of a

445
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,500
password survey or included in password

446
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
surveys so across different countries

447
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,360
branches

448
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,419
you know ngos or whatever it is

449
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,700
we could be able to compare results

450
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,240
across borders across countries across

451
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,080
ages genders and so on because today I

452
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,919
find that totally impossible to do

453
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,260
and with that

454
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,780
it is to be continued because I've been

455
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,760
doing this now for many years

456
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,160
and I will continue to do so as well if

457
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,140
anyone has a background in Psychology or

458
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,419
statistics or anything you know please

459
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,640
raise your hand ask questions Reach Out

460
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,559
link up with me on Twitter on LinkedIn

461
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,780
because I would really like to you know

462
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,179
uh

463
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,100
crowdsource information on this how to

464
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,140
ask the questions how to interpret them

465
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,419
how to explain them both to the

466
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,280
respondents and also to the people that

467
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,820
are going to ask people these questions

468
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,720
to make better password service

469
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,240
and that's basically my initial start

470
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,980
today

471
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,400
thank you and time for questions

472
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,000
hopefully

473
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,179
hello testing great fantastic I'm just

474
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,039
teasing you a little here so what is a

475
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,130
good password

476
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,329
[Music]

477
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,020
so uh

478
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,120
did like you know what time of the day

479
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,799
it is uh it's uh

480
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,679
just an example uh to me I say that a

481
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,260
good password is a simple positive

482
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,260
sentence that is easy for you to

483
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,900
remember that means something that has

484
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,580
happened in the past that won't change

485
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,840
in the future

486
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,299
which is very easy for you to remember

487
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,880
so for for the majority of band in here

488
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,740
maybe something not related to your you

489
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,500
know wedding date as an example but in

490
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,900
my case as an example I can say that

491
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,460
some of my passwords that I need to

492
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,340
remember are simple sentences that has

493
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,520
to do with my parents my family places

494
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,500
I've lived or they have lived or lived

495
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,740
today I know where that is and I need to

496
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,320
get seriously drunk to forget as an

497
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,380
example where I was born and raised

498
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,840
so with that information just made it

499
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
much easier for me to brute force your

500
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,530
password thank you

501
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,970
[Laughter]

502
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,400
okay I always have a question

503
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,419
um

504
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,140
given that people don't really even if

505
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,740
even if the questions are explained and

506
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,380
understood given that people don't

507
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,080
actually know the answers

508
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,600
to the questions

509
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,140
are surveys a good way

510
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,840
to get the information you're trying to

511
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,220
get and well I doing password surveys uh

512
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,220
would be better than not doing them but

513
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,120
so one more survey question

514
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
raise your hand

515
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,179
if you are an idiot

516
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,440
why am I doing this

517
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,419
that that one backfired

518
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,320
um

519
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,659
so the point of my question is this is

520
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,820
from John Cleese of Monty Python he have

521
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,280
said previously that if you ask an idiot

522
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,799
are you an idiot the idiot will say no

523
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,880
I'm not

524
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,679
and if you ask somebody who's not an

525
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,720
idiot they will also say no

526
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,059
and I think that password surveys just

527
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,539
like other things you can ask as well I

528
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,159
think there are a lot of people that

529
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,500
won't really that they really don't want

530
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,200
to sort of confess that they are doing

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,740
something stupid because you don't want

532
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,500
to be considered to be stupid and you

533
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,360
know what you're doing is not good but

534
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,860
you still do it anyway

535
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,440
so I'm not sure how to really respond to

536
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,799
the question issue initially but I think

537
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,720
that at least it's better to do password

538
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,760
service than not to do them

539
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,419
in your surveying do you see any

540
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,700
increased use in password managers and

541
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,740
do you believe those will help in

542
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,780
password hygiene in the long run or do

543
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,760
you think having that one Central

544
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,740
password controlling the Keys of the

545
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,600
Kingdom could do more harm than good

546
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,760
we I'm very sorry and I'm gonna give him

547
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,080
a chance to answer that question in a

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
minute but this man had the poor

549
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,799
judgment to make an outrageous speaker

550
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,380
request uh which was for a hug from

551
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,080
nouse now now it's intended to be here

552
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,820
in person to give you the hug but

553
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,620
instead she's stuck fighting a fire

554
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,539
downstairs so I had to go give her a hug

555
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,080
and get a hug from her to pass to you so

556
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,639
this is your surprise last night

557
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,799
I even went on tips it was just like she

558
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,320
would have to uh and I saw this stuff on

559
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,140
Slack and I couldn't remember my request

560
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,240
because I was afraid I actually asked

561
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,340
for spanking from Mouse and Melanie so

562
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,640
oh

563
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,539
I'm I'm really relieved now

564
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:05,820
yeah so to answer that one and I this is

565
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,880
the final one uh yes I really do believe

566
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,100
in password managers I do see an

567
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,919
increased use of them uh there's to me a

568
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,900
big difference between built-in password

569
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,600
managers in browsers and you know these

570
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,820
should I say Standalone uh password

571
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,140
managers

572
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,600
I do recommend password managers but not

573
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,940
for everyone for my own mother as an

574
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,340
example my parents I I've said just

575
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,659
write them down on a piece of paper

576
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,120
because your risk analysis the threat

577
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
scenario is nobody's interested in them

578
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,100
and keeping five six passers on a piece

579
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,260
of paper in the kitchen drawer is fine

580
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,140
the Russian fsp is not going to hogason

581
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,480
in Norway to break into my parents house

582
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,000
and try to get access to their accounts

583
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,700
they are not of that interest period

584
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,419
it's easy

585
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,760
absolutely amazing to be at b-sides

586
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,220
thank you Mouse

587
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,400
and that's it uh from my talk uh thank

588
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,679
you and in just a few minutes we have

589
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:11,290
Jeff

590
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,190
[Applause]
