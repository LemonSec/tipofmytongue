1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,500
um so I really love uh to be on the

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,799
program Committee of pastorscom uh and

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,599
this one from Jeremy Brown your password

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,880
should be shorter when I received that

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,679
and I just saw the title I was like oh

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,740
dude like this is gonna be hell on Earth

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,359
uh because we've had talks before

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,279
discussing password strength and

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,980
password length and it usually ends up

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,199
with a lot of discussions after the talk

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,199
so I this was a you know given to me I

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,320
had to say yes to this one uh and Jeremy

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,160
you know here we go take it away

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,399
thank you all right

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,980
let's see check check you can all hear

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,660
me uh you can all hear me from here

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,860
right

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,020
oh iffy in the back

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,450
okay

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,239
[Laughter]

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,559
how about now can you hear me in the

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,460
back

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,820
all right that's good so uh after that

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,059
introduction I'm Jeremy and I just want

25
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,940
to uh thank you for coming to my talk

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,099
welcome I know it's the last one before

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,200
lunch but uh I'm gonna try and get

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,580
through this quickly to get us all out

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,659
of here

30
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,500
uh so as I said I'm Jeremy and if you're

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,780
listening to me right now your passwords

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,360
probably should be shorter

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,580
now I want to begin my talk with a

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,220
vignette uh if you don't know who Drake

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,560
is he's an Entertainer He makes music

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,400
and some of his music has titles like uh

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,540
9 A.M in Dallas or 6 p.m in New York so

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,479
it's 9 30 p.m in Las Vegas you're at

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
hacker summer camp probably two

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,460
watered-down drinks in at some random

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,280
vendor party and you're just walking

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,500
around casually eavesdropping on

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,060
conversations

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,180
uh you have currently focused your

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,360
attention on Two infosec Bros who

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,820
originally started a conversation based

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,100
off comparing password managers but have

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,680
since pivoted to comparing the passwords

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
within them

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,439
now the first one says oh yeah man like

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,780
it's tough to be secure sometimes like

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,300
having to do 20 character passwords on

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,680
my phone where I have to hit the special

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,140
button twice to like open the curly

55
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,900
brace or an angle bracket just sucks so

56
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,800
hard

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,980
now the other Tech bro not to be outdone

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,520
says something like oh yeah sure I know

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,319
exactly what that's like but you know

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,739
all my passwords are 40 characters long

61
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,040
now the first tech bro feeling a little

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
bit defensive counters with something

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,260
like well well yeah but all my really

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,239
secure accounts have 64 character

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,980
passwords

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,340
and the second bro again to one-up him

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,519
says something like oh well you know I

68
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,860
use a hundred character passwords for

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,920
the accounts I just can't lose

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,900
now if you've been to hacker summer camp

71
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,540
uh more than once you've probably heard

72
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,819
a conversation like this if you've been

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,920
more than twice you've probably been on

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,260
one side of a conversation like this

75
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,900
and you know I'm not here to judge you

76
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm just here to inform you

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,980
and the first thing I'd like to inform

78
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,680
you about is that password truncation is

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
a thing

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,700
now thankfully in the year of our

81
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,700
forsaken guide 2022 pretty much

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,220
everybody understands that we don't

83
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,560
store passwords today we Store password

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,220
hashes most likely using bcrypt which is

85
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,959
based off the Blowfish encryption

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,220
algorithm

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,680
and this in and of itself is not a

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,400
problem

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Blowfish is a very strong encryption

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
algorithm and to the best of my

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,680
knowledge there have been no major

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,299
breaks against it

93
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,459
but it does have one important

94
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,319
limitation that I think many people

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,400
overlook

96
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,280
which which is that if you were to read

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,379
the original Blowfish documentation from

98
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,720
the 90s you would see that the Blowfish

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,420
key scheduler only uses the first 72

100
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,540
bytes of user provided input before

101
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,040
truncating

102
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,340
and notice I said 72 bytes there not 72

103
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,480
characters

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
now back in the mid 90s when Blowfish

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,500
was created this would be a distinction

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,079
without a difference the only encoding

107
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,579
anyone really cared about at the time

108
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,320
was ASCII and that was strictly 8-bit

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
characters

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,580
but nowadays we have this character

111
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,540
encoding called utf-8 and utf-8

112
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,120
supports these characters called emoji

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,940
and in case you don't know Emoji can

114
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,660
take up to four bytes to display one

115
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,180
so if you want it to get particularly

116
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,300
frisky and make your password all Emoji

117
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,940
you could only use up to 18 of them

118
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,699
before bcrypt would begin to truncate

119
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,139
your password

120
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,940
now you might say well sure the cool

121
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,340
kids hashing algorithm that all the

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,440
startups use might suck at storing

123
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,500
passwords but I'm sure bigger companies

124
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,139
have put in the time and effort to store

125
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,840
passwords correctly

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,880
yeah I don't know why you would think

127
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,699
that but just in case you forgot that

128
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,100
Microsoft used to shop passwords up into

129
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,080
two seven character hashes to make

130
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,979
cracking them easier until 2017 at the

131
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,320
earliest business Microsoft accounts

132
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,039
such as Office 365 only allowed you to

133
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
use a maximum of 16 characters now I

134
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,400
don't know if that was a soft truncation

135
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,500
where it would just drop all the

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,940
characters after or if it was a hard

137
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,380
truncation where I would say you can

138
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,060
only use 16 characters

139
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,479
but if Microsoft was getting it wrong in

140
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,500
2017 I doubt Oracle or IBM are getting

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,160
it right today

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,979
most practical security talks are

143
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,139
usually improved by defining a user

144
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,600
model I've tried to create one for this

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,500
talk

146
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,520
so our user is your typical infosec bro

147
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,400
actually scratch that they're in infosec

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,319
enthusiast

149
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,120
and as an infosec Enthusiast they have a

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,100
slightly outsized sense of self

151
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,180
and perhaps are a bit more paranoid than

152
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,300
generally warranted so naturally they

153
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,520
assume nation state adversaries are

154
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,819
against them and thusly they need strong

155
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,500
passwords

156
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,919
now this user has not created the threat

157
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,560
model or put any kind of thought into

158
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,539
how much effort NSA would actually

159
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,340
expand in cracking one of their

160
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,539
passwords

161
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,000
but what they did do was turn up the

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
generated password length and one

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,960
password and go hit the bars

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,319
now if we were to ask our user how long

165
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,680
they want their uh passwords to survive

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
an attack from the NSA

167
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,940
ears but that's four years on average so

168
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,180
it needs to last a maximum of eight

169
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,639
now

170
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,160
currently in the bad place

171
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,500
but for the purposes of this talk I'd

172
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,560
like to put us in the mildly worst place

173
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,680
where essentially everything is the same

174
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,380
except all everybody's stores their

175
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,620
passwords in single round unsalted md5

176
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,960
hashes like

177
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,080
yeah it's just mildly worse

178
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,840
now I began researching this topic back

179
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
in 2020 and at the time the most

180
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,940
powerful single hash cracking box I

181
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,699
could find was the Terra hash and Manus

182
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,280
however also at the time I couldn't find

183
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
much in terms of uh like hash cat

184
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
benchmarks so I had to use the next best

185
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,620
thing which was

186
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,280
an advertising tweet for a 45 box

187
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,599
cluster of 44 terahash in Manus and one

188
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,259
Tera hashbrutalis box comprising a total

189
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,419
of 448 RTX 2080 cards that could perform

190
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,300
roughly 2 to the 45 md5 hashes per

191
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,360
second back in 2020 or so

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,240
now this was a million dollar cluster at

193
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
the time not including uh the cost of

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
the energy to run all these boxes and

195
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,280
cards or to cool them

196
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,620
but the future is now and everything

197
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,780
else is in the cloud so why not put your

198
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,399
hashgracking box there

199
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,539
and to that end uh Amazon has introduced

200
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,979
the ec2 p4d cluster uh specifically here

201
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,300
the p4d 24 XL which is essentially a

202
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,040
supercomputer in the cloud

203
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
with 96 CPUs and over one terabyte of

204
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,899
RAM

205
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,040
along with eight Nvidia a100 gpus this

206
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,760
can perform roughly 2 to the 39 md5

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,320
hashes per second

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,540
now all this power doesn't come cheap at

209
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,820
a little under 33 dollars an hour

210
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,120
but if you were to reserve one for three

211
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
years the per year cost Falls to a

212
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,860
little over a hundred thousand dollars

213
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,880
per year

214
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
like on the screen you can also see the

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,920
p4de 24xl which has double the GPU

216
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,680
memory and is a little more expensive at

217
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,080
130 000 a year if reserved for three

218
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,860
years

219
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,380
but at the time of my research I

220
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,000
couldn't find any hashcad benchmarks on

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,339
the p4de so this talk will focus

222
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,700
primarily on the p4d

223
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
now at this point we should probably

224
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,720
begin asking ourselves how much effort

225
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,500
can we expend uh expect NSA to expand in

226
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,800
cracking a password now I think it makes

227
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
sense to start by giving them a p4d

228
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,279
cluster but our user objects

229
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,339
well but Jeremy NSA spends a hundred

230
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,260
thousand dollars a year on USB

231
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,240
tchotchkes that we're all too scared to

232
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,339
plug into our computers they're not

233
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,279
going to have just one p4d cluster

234
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,760
and you know what our users right NSA is

235
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,100
a government agency and the only thing

236
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,560
in a government agency loves more than

237
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,360
filling out forms in triplicate is

238
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,740
blowing their budget

239
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,800
so since we're in the mildly worst place

240
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,760
let's give NSA

241
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,660
9709 p4d clusters now that's roughly a

242
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,060
billion dollars per year on AWS and uh

243
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,880
the total of 9709 clusters is good for

244
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,700
roughly 2 to the 53 md5 hashes per

245
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,720
second

246
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,300
but again since we're in the mildly

247
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,320
worst place

248
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,839
let's give NSA an additional fudge

249
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,980
Factor up to 2 to the 57 md5 hashes per

250
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,019
second like just to make things a little

251
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,600
harder for ourselves

252
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,760
so to recap

253
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,380
we have an adversary that can Brute

254
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,200
Force at 2 to the 57 hashes per second

255
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,779
and we have a user who says their

256
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,579
passwords need to be able to last

257
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,700
against such an attack for a maximum of

258
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,779
eight years

259
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,540
so how many how many hashes could such a

260
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,360
adversary perform in eight years

261
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,120
well if we take out our trusty Dusty

262
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,050
calculators we will see

263
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,170
[Music]

264
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,320
I have to turn it to the side because

265
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,839
we're doing advanced math here

266
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,440
soon

267
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,760
that's 2 to the 85 hashes

268
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,339
so therefore any password our user needs

269
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,620
to generate we'll need 85 bits of

270
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,660
entropy to be secure against such an

271
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,139
attacker

272
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,279
how long does a password have to be in

273
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
order to have 85 bits of entropy

274
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,339
well they can definitely be shorter if

275
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,440
you allow keyboard specials because they

276
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,180
will bump up our per character entropy

277
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,820
and thus let us hit our entropy targets

278
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,399
quick more quickly

279
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,579
but I don't know about you but every

280
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,100
time I've had to like put my TV like

281
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,579
when I've had the bad idea to connect my

282
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,459
TV to Wi-Fi and I've had to like put in

283
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,700
special characters because my my uh

284
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,060
Wi-Fi network is like 64 characters long

285
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,860
and it's got like a dollar sign and a

286
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,959
curly brace and a back tick and all that

287
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
like I die inside so let's not even

288
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,660
consider those and we'll stick to just

289
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,760
uppercase English letters lowercase

290
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,160
English letters and numbers

291
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,600
so how many how many characters would we

292
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,120
need using just uppers lowers and

293
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,820
numbers to meet our entropy goal

294
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,459
well pull out our calculator again

295
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,600
let's say

296
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,320
15.

297
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,899
just 15 characters

298
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,240
and I want to remind you this

299
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,519
hypothetical has favorite NSA at

300
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,980
basically at every turn like we are

301
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,079
storing all our passwords in pretty much

302
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,019
the worst possible fashion today short

303
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,320
of plain text we have rounded up nsa's

304
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,139
compute power multiple times and given

305
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,540
them a fudge Factor on top

306
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,240
we are letting them spend a billion

307
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,320
dollars a year for eight years to crack

308
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,320
just one hash and it still gets beaten

309
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,620
by 15 alphanumeric characters

310
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,139
and I want to remind you like this

311
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,360
assumes NSA knows your password topology

312
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,420
a priority so they only try 15 character

313
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,940
alphanumeric passwords if they start

314
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,800
with shorter passwords or they start

315
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,420
with passwords that contain special

316
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,940
characters they'll waste even more time

317
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,920
and not get anywhere close to finding

318
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,139
the real password

319
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,019
now at this point our user has another

320
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,800
objection oh but that fails to meet my

321
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,019
arbitrary security goals against my

322
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,600
adversary whose ability isn't based in

323
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,019
reality

324
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,620
and

325
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,680
I mean that may be true but I want to

326
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,660
assure you that all is not lost

327
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,899
first off any adversary if we were to

328
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,699
leave the mildly worse place and return

329
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,279
back to the bad place any mildly

330
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,740
competent organization today isn't

331
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,500
storing passwords in uh unsolved

332
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,019
unsalted single round md5 hashes they

333
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,100
will be using bcrypt s-crypt pbkdf2 or

334
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,620
if they're particularly fancy argon2

335
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,680
and let me tell you nobody is getting

336
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,860
close to 2 to the 57 argon two hashes

337
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,260
per second today

338
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,160
secondly

339
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,079
if account access is what's important

340
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,980
and not just uh finding the pre-image of

341
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,800
a particular hash you using a u2f key

342
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,899
would be superior to using a longer

343
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,500
password along any metric anybody really

344
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,899
cares about and additionally provides a

345
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,480
fringe benefit against phishing not that

346
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,519
our user would think that's uh very

347
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,500
useful to them as they are so

348
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
sophisticated they could never be fished

349
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,680
they're sort of like the infosec version

350
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,899
of Drax over there

351
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,420
and lastly if the data the if the

352
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,440
account

353
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
the password is attached to is related

354
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,480
to a US service or the data the password

355
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,199
protects is on a server on U.S soil well

356
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,740
then the NSA is just one rubber stamp

357
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,420
physio warrant away from getting it

358
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,279
anyway kind of rendering all of this

359
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,199
mood

360
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,519
uh however our user comes up with one

361
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,800
half decent objection which is that they

362
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,079
have to use a computer that won't accept

363
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,079
a password without special characters

364
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,600
and you know I understand that like I

365
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,540
too have had to work on systems whose

366
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,160
admins haven't read a nist guidelines

367
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,899
since 1996

368
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,600
but to that end the solution is simple

369
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,180
you just generate a 15 character

370
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,339
password anyway choose your favorite

371
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,380
special character and then put it on the

372
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,779
end so the computer gets to check its

373
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,699
box but the actual strength of your

374
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,920
password is based off the 15 characters

375
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,500
that came before and not the special

376
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,139
this additionally allows you to avoid

377
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,820
the situation where you have to keep

378
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,519
regenerating uh random passwords because

379
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,199
the random password you've been getting

380
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,360
have special characters that the

381
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,199
computer doesn't like

382
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,899
uh now at this point our users still

383
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,060
somewhat reluctant to accept the light

384
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,820
of reason and math so I'm gonna break

385
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,880
out the big guns and let them know that

386
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,579
hashcat developer Tara hash founder and

387
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,859
Defcon password Village Stafford Jeremy

388
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,419
Gosney agrees with me

389
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,419
now you might say well sure of course

390
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,579
the founder of a password cracking

391
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,140
company wants people to use shorter

392
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,260
passwords but I mean he's not wrong

393
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,059
about the math

394
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,839
a 20 character uh password with keyboard

395
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,959
specials has more entropy in it than the

396
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,120
TLs key that will protect it in transit

397
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,780
so you could go from any longer password

398
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,840
to 20 characters with real with no real

399
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,840
loss in security and if anybody could

400
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,780
crack one of those they could just break

401
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,260
TLS and at that point we're all

402
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,280
regardless of how long our passwords are

403
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,700
now I'm sure by this point everyone is

404
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,860
going to run to update your generated

405
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,380
password settings but let's not be so

406
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,760
Hasty now this scenario has NSA spending

407
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,700
a billion dollars a year for almost a

408
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,559
decade to crack a single hash if we were

409
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,140
back into a more realistic scenario

410
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,080
where NSA only has 10 of these p4d

411
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,840
clusters spending a million dollars a

412
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,919
year on AWS for 2 to the 43 md5 hashes

413
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,660
per second

414
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,539
20 years to crack a single hash

415
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,700
then you can still defeat them using

416
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,520
only 13 characters and again I want to

417
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,980
remind you nobody's doing 2 to the 43

418
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,559
pbkdf2 bcrypt s Crypt or argon2 hashes

419
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,520
today and by the time we can it's highly

420
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,740
likely that the

421
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,679
that the service the password hash is

422
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,320
connected to will have folded due to not

423
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,399
being able to make money

424
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,240
inclusion

425
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
no you don't need to make your bank

426
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,559
password 64 characters long with

427
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,020
specials and Emoji even if you'll always

428
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,660
use your password manager to enter it

429
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,620
now you might say well Jeremy it it's

430
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,320
not hurting anyone if I keep doing this

431
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,240
right and no it isn't but I have a

432
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,059
feeling if you're at hacker summer camp

433
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,740
you probably have opinions on security

434
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,100
theater and let me tell you a password

435
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,440
with more entropy than the TLs keep

436
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,600
protecting it is the height of security

437
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,679
theater

438
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,580
so you can keep using 64 character

439
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,559
passwords and like the password police

440
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,260
aren't going to come for you but if you

441
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,720
do I don't want to hear you talk any

442
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,840
kind of about TSA anymore

443
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,160
and with that I end my talk uh my I do

444
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,140
tweets sometimes if you wanted to read

445
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,200
them I don't know why uh the QR code on

446
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,960
the left links to my Twitter account uh

447
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,720
if you wanted to point someone to this

448
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,820
talk but you didn't want to have them

449
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,500
listen to me ramble on for 20 minutes

450
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,039
the QR code on the right links to a blog

451
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,799
post version of this talk and with that

452
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,360
I think we can open it up for questions

453
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,100
thank you

454
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,559
well you know I I don't even know where

455
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
to start if I should say I feel harassed

456
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,280
or abused or uh uh again also the NSA

457
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,799
like dude have you ever met the hashcard

458
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,500
team I mean like

459
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,240
those are the process tracking stuff not

460
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,059
that the other side but questions lots

461
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,539
of them okay

462
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,960
so the question was what if my password

463
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,840
is all A's and like

464
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,080
if your password is all A's I mean you

465
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,780
could have 128 A's and I'll still

466
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,299
probably get uh cracked in like under

467
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,100
five minutes

468
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,380
like I don't know if

469
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,080
I if your password is longer but still

470
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,799
very oh put it this way correct horse

471
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,340
battery staple is like 40 characters but

472
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,860
that's not gonna last long

473
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,440
there there are other benefits to longer

474
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,380
passwords like five word diceware type

475
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,679
phrases uh that make it easier not to

476
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,020
not to crack or not crack a password

477
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,200
crack or defend a password I guess but

478
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,679
to manage it in the context of humans

479
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,080
that have to do something with it oh yes

480
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,100
I uh so the point there was uh using

481
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,559
like having longer passwords is fine if

482
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,980
they are things like uh use generated

483
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,659
via diceware because that uses human

484
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,400
words and then humans can memorize those

485
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,679
words and that's true I was focusing

486
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,679
more on uh randomly generated passwords

487
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,039
like the type you get from uh like one

488
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,620
pass LastPass and those I don't know if

489
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,719
any of those do diceware style passwords

490
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,960
oh bid Wharton does so you might want to

491
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,919
like

492
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,419
I would

493
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,880
if I wanted to if I cared about human

494
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,980
memorable passwords then yes this

495
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,799
doesn't necessarily apply but the way

496
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,840
you generate entropy is different for

497
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,240
diceware passwords versus the typical

498
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,940
randomly generated passwords that I that

499
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,799
this talk is about

500
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,919
so I happen to be the person who wrote

501
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,720
the diceware like uh generator in what

502
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,320
oh sure yeah so I'm the one who actually

503
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,799
wrote the diceware like generator in one

504
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,860
password so I can say we have it and

505
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,039
we've had it for quite some time uh but

506
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,380
closely to the point of your talk and

507
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,260
I'm fully agreeing with the last two

508
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,260
minutes that I heard as I walked in late

509
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,919
um

510
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,820
uh when we set in one password the

511
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,520
default length for generated

512
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,860
gibberish passwords

513
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,720
we knew that 13 14 characters would be

514
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,799
enough

515
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,700
and we just said look we've got to make

516
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,860
it more than 16 or people will think

517
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,380
they're too weak

518
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,620
right okay so the point there was humans

519
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,780
are dumb and we had to make them

520
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,179
stronger than they needed to be so

521
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,460
humans wouldn't freak out and

522
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,880
and that's

523
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,760
I that's fair I was focusing mostly on

524
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,039
the actual entropy inside the password

525
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,740
but if you have to make it

526
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,900
if you have to make your passwords

527
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,600
longer so your CSO doesn't flip a brick

528
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,159
then

529
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,720
I guess that's what you'll have to do

530
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
but hopefully your CSO well you can

531
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,159
point your seats out to this talk and

532
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,840
then they can see oh they don't have to

533
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,299
be 16 characters they can just be 15

534
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,460
characters with no specials and that's

535
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,120
more than enough

536
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,740
Heather I was just wondering in your

537
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,960
opinion what would be the best way to

538
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,539
draw Upstream service providers or

539
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,460
supply chain Partners to this talk

540
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,140
what's the best way to get non-technical

541
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,880
people in tune with your your

542
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,580
recommendations here

543
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,779
like

544
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:19,520
I think

545
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,980
the best thing might be to like

546
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,380
I would need to write a white paper or

547
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,200
something and then get a booth at RSA to

548
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,600
give it to them but I don't have that

549
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,740
kind of money so maybe you can like I

550
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,840
made a Blog on this you can maybe Point

551
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,640
them to the blog and then have them read

552
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,799
it and then hopefully it'll get through

553
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,220
to them

554
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,960
so you know like

555
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,120
there are dark patterns that we all

556
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,880
Experience day to day what if a really

557
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,700
long annoying complicated password is

558
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,100
actually just a dark pattern to try to

559
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,260
get my users to use my Federated single

560
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,020
sign-on thing because in incident

561
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,600
response you know a huge number of

562
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,100
incidents that I experience are with

563
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,559
people that are not using the single

564
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,919
sign-on thing like if we actually make

565
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,700
it harder to do short passwords maybe we

566
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,880
can direct people towards the easier

567
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,960
answer which is have one password for

568
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,960
everything and then

569
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,600
single sign-on everywhere

570
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,900
I think that goes back to a point I made

571
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,960
earlier in the talk which is that if you

572
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,100
want

573
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,620
like in that sort of situation where you

574
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,539
really care about security you'd

575
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,919
probably be better off by giving

576
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,159
everybody like a u2f dongle and then

577
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,100
like require two Factor so it doesn't

578
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,380
really matter how long their passwords

579
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,440
are because like somebody won't be able

580
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,340
to get to that you know u2f token to get

581
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,580
in and you could possibly roll that into

582
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,640
your single sign-on system or whatever

583
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,220
but I would probably say do that instead

584
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,419
of make people use stupid long passwords

585
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,120
hi great talk Ira Victor I live here in

586
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,000
Nevada I helped write the bill that made

587
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,320
the center for Internet Security

588
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
controls considered the standard for

589
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,460
data security in Nevada and it's now in

590
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,279
four other states like that I think an

591
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,380
alternate to getting a table at stupid

592
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,740
RSA would be to have the center for

593
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,600
Internet Security put this into their

594
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,820
controls and I'd be willing to do an

595
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,580
introduction to those people there

596
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,820
thank you yeah if

597
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,600
if we could somehow get it into law that

598
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,059
yeah you don't have to do ridiculous

599
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,880
passwords like that so people can point

600
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,220
to that that'd be great the question the

601
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,140
item is that anybody can do whatever

602
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,600
they want with their data but with these

603
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,880
laws and states it gives a Safe Harbor

604
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,039
from litigation when you follow a

605
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,080
standard like the center for Internet

606
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,820
Security so we don't need a law that

607
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,100
says make your password short or long we

608
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,539
need to say hey you're not going to get

609
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,480
sued if you follow a good standard the

610
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,279
good standard in many states is now

611
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,559
Center for Internet Security then we put

612
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,360
this as part of cons of the

613
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,580
consideration for what is a good

614
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,679
standard for data security

615
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,440
like yeah that could work

616
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,140
uh you you talked about trying to

617
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,700
protect

618
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,500
um something for eight years or 20 years

619
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,779
or something like that it doesn't sound

620
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,880
as though you were considering I mean I

621
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,100
I doubt that Amazon is going to be

622
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,860
having exactly the same offerings in

623
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,779
eight years or 20 years they're going to

624
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,419
have much faster things by then did you

625
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,840
consider what happens when you factor in

626
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,299
a Moore's Law effect on the uh on the

627
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,620
cracking

628
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,480
uh to an end yes that's slightly uh

629
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,179
I deal with that slightly by giving NSA

630
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,200
the fudge Factor but additionally

631
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,539
like the numbers

632
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,659
the numbers I chose like the numbers I

633
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,760
targeted were so ridiculously

634
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,520
overpowered that Moore's Law isn't Gonna

635
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,100
Get Us close to them anytime soon like

636
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,960
like I said

637
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,080
we're not doing like close to 2 to the

638
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,640
43 s-crypt hashes anytime soon

639
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,500
uh

640
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,960
the numbers I the numbers I was talking

641
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,620
about before were for uh just md5 alone

642
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,980
and that is Far and Away the fat like

643
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,399
the fastest uh algorithm to crack today

644
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,720
but like B Crypt and S script are like

645
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,020
three to five orders of magnitude slower

646
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,659
like it's gonna take a long time just

647
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,220
for

648
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,820
b-crypt to get to where md5 is today

649
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,559
and even at that point you're still safe

650
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,059
by using just 15 characters

651
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,240
okay uh well I'll give it one more uh

652
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,120
one more question last one

653
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,700
okay so I gotta say that um

654
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,500
a solid argument

655
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,360
you know it's very entertaining but the

656
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,860
thing that I've learned in this business

657
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,980
is that any recommendation you have

658
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,419
people will take it kind of to the

659
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,640
extreme you know like we said

660
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,159
no you know password passwords must

661
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,419
expire and then all of a sudden people

662
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,159
are doing a 30-day expiration on

663
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,380
passwords so now we're saying passwords

664
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,659
don't need to expire that quickly now

665
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:37,919
people are saying there never should

666
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,039
expire and you know it should include

667
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,659
random characters and then it got to

668
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,399
where people you know needed 200 bits of

669
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,140
entropy so anyway

670
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,039
um

671
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,899
you say they should be longer and then

672
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:49,980
people are wanting 100 character

673
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,840
passwords now you're saying shorter just

674
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,059
you got to be careful with with any kind

675
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,320
of advice in this business because

676
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,240
people will take it to the extreme and I

677
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,320
just want to say that because I don't

678
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,520
want to see the next recommendation

679
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,980
being eight character passwords so

680
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,220
well

681
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,260
I guess if I if I'm making a

682
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,419
recommendation it's that all passwords

683
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,120
should be 15 character alphanumerics and

684
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,480
I think even if like

685
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,679
so

686
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,960
everybody started expiring passwords

687
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,500
because nist wrote it up sometime in the

688
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,419
past that you have to do it and then

689
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,100
this okay in 2003 and then nist realized

690
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,140
that was not useful and they got rid of

691
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,419
it very recently so

692
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,100
I think

693
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,140
people did it because nist said that's

694
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,200
what we should do and if we could make

695
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,360
this say make all your passwords 15

696
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,520
character alphanumerics then that's what

697
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,440
they would do and that would be more

698
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,960
than enough for basically any situation

699
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,220
today so I mean we could try that or you

700
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,760
know we can say nist is a guideline and

701
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,179
not a rule and and I have to give people

702
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,460
now the option of going for lunch as

703
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,580
well but at two o'clock in one and a

704
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,500
half hours we actually have Jim Fenton

705
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,039
speaking and his name is standard so

706
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,320
he's right over there so I think YouTube

707
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,659
needs to talk

708
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:16,799
have a great lunch and I'll see you back

709
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,700
at two o'clock

710
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,220
