1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,720
so uh there have been several changes in

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,720
the schedule as uh

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,399
you've seen and heard maybe from me as

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,919
well uh

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
we are still in a co-work world uh there

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
have been people with visa problems

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,120
there are

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,880
been people that have catch covet and

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
couldn't come

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
so we haven't been uh we've had to turn

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
upside down the program

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,640
quite a bit

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
and i

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
had myself as a backup speaker as i

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
usually do because i wanted to talk

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,359
about

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,359
um

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,079
password cracking and what i think about

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,559
doing that ethically and morally this is

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,480
sort of a discussion that we've had

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
ongoing with passwords con for many

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,600
years already it started back in

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,600
2015 at the university of cambridge in

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
uk

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
where we

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
had a speaker from russia

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
she wasn't really that interested in

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
password cracking but her husband was

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,159
really interested in doing this stuff

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,200
and she did a talk about the ethics of

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
doing password cracking

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
because in most cases we are downloading

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
data that has been

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
copied illegally or stolen or whatever

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
you want to call it from

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
some servers some company out there and

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
we crack the passwords we see the emails

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
we see the usernames

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
the real names and so on of those people

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
and there's the thing about you know is

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
this

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
legally

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,320
allowed to do is it's ethical it's small

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,439
to do

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,880
now during the years i have experienced

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,159
my fair share of

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,280
um

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
i've been thinking about a lot about

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,759
this

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
would i've had what i have done myself

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
cracking

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
millions and millions and millions of

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,840
passwords during the past

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,360
22

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,079
23 years and still not ongoing

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,719
and i also thought that while doing that

57
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,000
as a talk

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,758
to finish off passwords con in las vegas

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,239
is probably not the best idea i can do

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,360
so

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
and now also waiting for jeremy gosling

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
i thought that well

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
instead of just

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,200
doing sad stuff

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,599
i will show you a couple of slides that

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
i've been doing lately uh as part of

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
almost a lightning talk

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
uh with some fun stuff in it

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,840
some might have seen this

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
before some might not

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,599
but i will start with the

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
the simple part so this is the license

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,239
plate of my car uh zero points for

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,280
guessing

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
what it says in norwegian on that plate

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
and this is also the quote that i have

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
on twitter i said that i have a

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
reputation to maintain

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,400
i have it verbally from cormac early at

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
microsoft research

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,519
with a witness present that he's

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,959
interested in passwords well i'm

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,000
obsessed with it and i do ask cormac to

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,239
please confirm statements

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
and he responds in public confirm i have

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
a healthy curiosity while tulsam is

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
pathologically obsessed

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
and i'm actually

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
proud of getting that from cormac

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,760
because he's

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
really good at his research and he has

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
done research into passwords and

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
usability stuff for for quite a few

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
years

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
you might also have seen this but i use

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
this to sort of exemplify what i say is

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
the value of a single password

98
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
this happened quite a few years ago this

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
is twitter this is a soji associated

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,400
press one of the largest news agencies

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
in the world at the time they had two

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
million followers

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
and one they suddenly tweeted the

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,879
message saying breaking two explosions

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
in the white house and barack obama was

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
injured

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
now there were never any explosions

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
there and there were never you know bark

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,360
bombers was never injured in any way

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
and it's sort of crazy to think that way

111
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,560
well why would a news agency put out a

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
tweet like that

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
and it's also interesting to see that in

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
this case this tweet appeared only with

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
associative press it was not mentioned

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
it was not published in any other media

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,759
no other channel at all of associated

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
press only on twitter

119
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
and this was before twitter had to have

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
publication so you can probably guess

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,479
where i'm going with this

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
and this is the dojo's index that day

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
you can see in the morning that you know

124
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
do is going up

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
and it's pretty good looks like a good

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,040
day

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
and you can probably spot the location

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
where suddenly ap tweets

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
that has been explosions and the

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,080
president is injured

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,960
now

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,199
that drop in the dough john's index was

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
136.5

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
billion dollars

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
in worth

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,840
that's a lot of money

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,759
and they had to stop trading to figure

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
out you know what the hell is this

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
message from ap about and of course yep

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,199
this is

141
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
this is not for real

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
and they could re-establish trading and

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,759
everything went smoothly at least it

144
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,639
looks like that the rest of the way

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
and this happened because

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
jeremy gosling is in the house the man

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
the legend

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
bye jeremy

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,039
bye

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,199
hi baby doll hi

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,090
family

152
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,400
[Laughter]

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
i just started talking waiting for you

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
jeremy i'm just filling in with some

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
crap

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,520
yeah yeah that's exactly what this just

157
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240


158
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,320
the point is here ap got phished

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
two or three maybe four people at ap got

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
an email they clicked the link one of

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
them was tricked into giving away

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,919
username and password for the ap twitter

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,120
account

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,319
and it was actually the syrian

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
electronic army who claimed to have done

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
this

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,199
they have

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
ceased to exist i think i don't know if

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
they're dead

170
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
but they did a lot of really interesting

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
hacks back in the days

172
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
and i say that well the value of a

173
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,960
single password is

174
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,560
136.5 billion dollars in worst case

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
and even more fun i said this one

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,039
earlier today but i here's the graphical

177
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
explanation operation face factor

178
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
5000 photos people and also we knew

179
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
their passwords and we decided to stuff

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
it into the database and analyze the

181
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,360
data

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
so me and my friend we looked at gender

183
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
we categorized by whether the people

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
were wearing glasses in the pictures or

185
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
not the pictures were

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
pictures from access cars physical

187
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
access cards

188
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
we also categorized by hair color saying

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
well there's no hair present

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
it could be blonde super blonde brunette

191
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
red hat black or silver fox you probably

192
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,720
understand what i mean by that

193
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,400
and of course you can also have facial

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
hair so we said well there's no facial

195
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,199
hair

196
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
there's the moustache the small bear a

197
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
full bed and looking at these pictures

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,840
we had to define the category of unix

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,319
skewer

200
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
i don't have to explain that anymore

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
and we also had a coderick category of

202
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
porn

203
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,199
donuts you probably know what that is as

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
well

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
yeah the very short one around your

206
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
mouth that's the pond doughnut that's

207
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
like

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,039
back in the 80s and watching american

209
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,080
crime on tv i guess

210
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
that poster okay poor stash okay

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
so we did this stuff this into database

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,919
then we could

213
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
do the queries and what we did well we

214
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,759
found

215
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,879
where women prefer life

216
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,000
on average women had longer passwords

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
than men

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
and we also found that men prefer

219
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
higher variety or character entropy they

220
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
used more different letters from the

221
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
alphabet and special characters in the

222
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
passwords

223
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
and we also found

224
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
that you'd excluders have the absolutely

225
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
worst passwords

226
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
now i know what company this is about

227
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
because you know i was doing pen testing

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
for them so i know sort of the reasoning

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,240
behind this as well

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,360
it services company perhaps

231
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,039
um but it was a lot of fun now the crazy

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
thing about this because this is you

233
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,920
know

234
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
me and a friend of mine doing this while

235
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
we're partially drunk and we thought

236
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
this was incredibly funny

237
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,040
but i

238
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
i presented this in many many talks and

239
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
one day

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
bbc news decided to do an article about

241
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
that

242
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
and if you go online and google search

243
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
you can't see it there too too easy here

244
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
but you can find the original article

245
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,120
from bbc news where they are basically

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,640
saying that women prefer longer

247
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
passwords so women prefer length

248
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
and as you just heard from the male

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,080
audience in here as well laughing

250
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,959
that

251
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
i remember then out when that article

252
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
was published from bbc news you know

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,080
reading the comments for that article

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
was

255
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
kind of crazy did you bbc news just

256
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
write that women prefer length and that

257
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
is now scientifically statistically

258
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,480
proven that's

259
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
interesting

260
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
and i have talked to people that are

261
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
really good in statistics and they say

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
well

263
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
if you have a selection of 5 000 people

264
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
and you can say that from based on that

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
women prefer length

266
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
then you are correct about the entire

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
population on planet earth

268
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
until somebody can prove you wrong so

269
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,839
kind of funny

270
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,200
but you're going to have on other

271
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
interests

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,880
other interests in life than passwords i

273
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,040
also take a huge interest in pin codes

274
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
as well

275
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,640
and back in fall of 2013 i went to a

276
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,360
local school in bergen my hometown

277
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,560
and did a talk about passwords obviously

278
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
and i asked the girls and the boys in

279
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
the room to write down

280
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
a four digit pin

281
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
that they were absolutely sure they

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
could remember in a month

283
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,800
if i were to return and ask them do you

284
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
remember your pin code

285
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,279
four digit pin

286
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,959
now any wild guesses on you know

287
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,839
the choice of pin

288
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
code birthdays yeah

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
well i can reveal that the girls the

290
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
most popular pin code selected by the

291
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,399
girls was 1996

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,079
and that's their year of birth

293
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
i can also reveal to you that among the

294
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
boys 1996 was the second most popular

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
pin code

296
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
but which for the pink coil was the most

297
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
commonly selected pin code among 17 year

298
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
old boys

299
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,760
this audience test never fails

300
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,079
if there are men responding first it's

301
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,320
going to be 69 69 or 1234

302
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
thus proving the you know superior

303
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
intelligence of men

304
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
and even funnier if there is a woman

305
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
responding first

306
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,480
would also say 6969

307
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
all one two three four thus proving that

308
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,120
women actually understand men

309
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,040
but the thing is

310
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
the most selected pin code among these

311
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
boys was one three three seven

312
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,720
now the fun thing here is with this

313
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,200
audience

314
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
at that school

315
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
when i said how many of you selected one

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
three three seven

317
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,839
a few of these boys they just went like

318
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,120
yeah

319
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
dude

320
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
whoa

321
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
whoa

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
and all the girls in the room they were

323
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
just like

324
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,920
what happened now because there was no

325
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,320
women no girls in here that selected one

326
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
three three seven

327
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,560
now what is one three three seven hands

328
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,320
up

329
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
and in women cecilia knows you know yep

330
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,639
so you read the numbers as letters that

331
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
means l-e-e-t

332
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,760
elite

333
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,839
short for elite

334
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
if you play computer games you play

335
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
against somebody else they are really

336
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,120
good

337
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
and the round of world of warcraft or

338
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,120
call of duty or whatever

339
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
you will type in one through

340
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
one three three seven saying like whoa

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
you're really good

342
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
when i explained that in this audience

343
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
with these students

344
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
all the girls no exceptions

345
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
oh god

346
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,560
and then i went to the university in

347
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
trondheim in norway a little bit further

348
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
up north

349
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
now we're talking students 19 20 21 22

350
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
years old

351
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,839
and i also showed

352
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,320
this and there was one woman

353
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
in the room that raised her hand and

354
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,920
said yep i picked 137.

355
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
and obviously i ran up to her like

356
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,199
wow

357
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,399
you could be the girl of my dreams i

358
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
just gotta make sure you know do you

359
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
play computer games because that's sort

360
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,199
of

361
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,760
well something that i do still at age

362
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,279
50.

363
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,279
she said

364
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,079
no

365
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
i don't

366
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,959
but i i do have male friends that play

367
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,120
computer games but i don't okay well

368
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000


369
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,240
ah that's too bad but why did you select

370
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,310
one three lisa

371
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,240
[Music]

372
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,880
and her response was well

373
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
my postal address just outside the

374
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
capital of oslo

375
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,959
is one three three seven

376
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,800
and obviously all the main students will

377
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,480
just like okay

378
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,839
i know i'm moving

379
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,839
so

380
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,240
a bit of fun a bit of

381
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,760
fun statistics and and surveys for you

382
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
but again this also proves something

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
that i've been saying for many many many

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
years we are incredibly predictable when

385
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
it comes to our choice in pastors and

386
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
pin codes

387
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
and who you are

388
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,000
your interests your gender your age your

389
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
parents your family wherever you work

390
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,639
the stuff that you have in your office

391
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,240
cubicle

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,199
will most probably be association

393
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
elements for your password

394
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
so here's also something that i did uh

395
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
several years ago this is martin luger

396
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,880
she was a master thesis student

397
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,680
and

398
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
she got an assignment from me i was

399
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,600
co-supervisor look into how people pick

400
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
their look patterns android look

401
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
patterns

402
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,959
and she did

403
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,560
she also spoke about this here at

404
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
passwords con she also did a talk at

405
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
defcon

406
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
about this as she discovered that well

407
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
at least 10 percent of us will just do a

408
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,800
simple

409
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,519
english alphabet letter when you select

410
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,480
an android look pattern

411
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,880
she got the best possible score for a

412
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
master thesis she got

413
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
lots of questions and fantastic feedback

414
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
at defcon

415
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,519
and even better in my opinion

416
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,639
a couple of years after she finished

417
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,800
graduated and delivered her master

418
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
thesis

419
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,519
she got an email from

420
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,839
the police

421
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,720
in one country somewhere in europe

422
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
and they said

423
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
thank you

424
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
for that research

425
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
because that actually enabled them to

426
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
get into a phone

427
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,920
that they were not able to get into

428
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
otherwise

429
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
and finding pictures

430
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,320
revealing information related to

431
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
abuse

432
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,519
and the murder

433
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,079
in a close relationship

434
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
so i'm not doing this just for the

435
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,560
thought of it this is lots of serious

436
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
stuff

437
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
and then steve jobs came on on stage

438
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,079
and introduced the iphone 5s with the

439
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,600
touch id

440
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,079
and somebody tweeted a picture

441
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
that you know summarizes summarizes my

442
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
opinion on biometric security in one

443
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,638
single picture

444
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,880
that's my opinion on biometric security

445
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,919
in almost all cases biometric security

446
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,919
is not biometric security it is

447
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
biometric usability

448
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
it increases usability

449
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,839
by a lot i use biometrics myself on my

450
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,199
iphone

451
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
but i can just swipe up

452
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,439
left or right and have a go at your pin

453
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,400
code

454
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,919
in any case

455
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
so if you want to have good security on

456
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
your iphone or your android device you

457
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,000
need a really strong pin

458
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
even if you are using biometrics

459
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
otherwise it will be easy for me to get

460
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
into your phone

461
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,960
and also when uh people got hold of

462
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
their iphone 5s there were some guys in

463
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,160
jab in japan doing this video because

464
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,280
you don't really need to use your finger

465
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,000
any part of your skin that has

466
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
wrinkles

467
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
can be used

468
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,840
so if you want to before going to defcon

469
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
and you're afraid somebody is going to

470
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
steal your fingerprints on your phone

471
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,480
don't use your finger use uh another

472
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
part of your body

473
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,880
so i like to troll people

474
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,679
and with uh cso at another company back

475
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,360
home in norway i'm having a little bit

476
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,320
of fun i don't know how this started but

477
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,919
what we do is every time there is a leak

478
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,919
or some company especially in norway is

479
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
getting hacked

480
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
i say

481
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
it's because of passwords

482
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
there's a shitty password there's a

483
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
default password there's lack of two

484
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
vertication there's something related to

485
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,840
passwords that essentially made them get

486
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
hacked

487
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,280
and he says

488
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,840
it cannot be that bad it cannot be

489
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
happening that often it's zero days it's

490
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
russian intelligence services that are

491
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
using advanced hackers and everything

492
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
and i say no you can hack pretty much

493
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,760
anyone using simple pins or passwords

494
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,039
and whenever i'm right the problem is

495
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
password related

496
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
and we're on video so i can't really

497
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
play sound here

498
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,678
that's right

499
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,320
he um

500
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
he needs to watch

501
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
bg's you win again

502
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,160
and to end on youtube

503
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
and whenever he wins

504
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
because somebody got hacked and it was

505
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,919
not

506
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,240
because of bad passwords

507
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
i have to listen to shaggy it wasn't me

508
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
i have watched that video

509
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
i don't know maybe two times

510
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,678
and he seriously hate the bgs

511
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,799
and he does this every time the entire

512
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,600
music video on youtube bgs you win again

513
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,039
so

514
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
here he is in romania because he was

515
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,720
traveling and suddenly i had to send him

516
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
the link to the video and he just knew

517
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,200
that oh it happened again

518
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,039
so uh that's my short fun talk

519
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,600
and now the man the legend himself

520
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,640
passwords but make it to nihilism

521
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
jeremy gosney

522
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,880
how you doing buddy it's good to see you

523
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
yeah likewise it's been like what three

524
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
years four years

525
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
six

526
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
oh right there's a trap yeah one

527
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,919
one president and one pandemic and i'm

528
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,440
not sure what was

529
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,039
the worst part i've had three kids in

530
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,600
that amount of time man that's crazy

531
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,360
all right

532
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
no one give me covet

533
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,640
all right so as pair said i'm jeremy

534
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
ghazni and i'm here to tell you that you

535
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
all suck at threat modeling

536
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
passwords we've been doing it wrong for

537
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
years please get your frame throwers

538
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
ready actually what we're gonna do

539
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,640
don't just take my word for it we're

540
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,159
gonna walk through it together we're

541
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,760
gonna threat model password security

542
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
right here right now you're gonna see

543
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,039
that it's all we've been doing

544
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
it wrong the entire time so i've been

545
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
getting looped into twitter threads for

546
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,159
the past i don't know what

547
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,440
seven years

548
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
people like crying about like oh this

549
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
side only accept a maximum of 16

550
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,799
passwords can you believe it oh hashtag

551
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,200
password too strong and like that

552
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
so

553
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
i'm i'm i'm not gonna say i'm tired of

554
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,640
it but my wife will tell you when i get

555
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,159
drawn into these twitter threads i sigh

556
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,440
and she's like what what twitter drama

557
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
was it now like nothing like you know

558
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,480
like so and so is pulling me into some

559
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,840
 on twitter and i gotta you know

560
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
set them straight

561
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
but

562
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,280
let's just back up a minute so

563
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
i used to say and i've been quoted

564
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,559
saying this i mean like adam shostak's

565
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,559
book on threat modeling saying this that

566
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,440
password hashing is an insurance policy

567
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,559
and i thought this was really clever

568
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,000
when i came up with this i said that

569
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
password hashing is an insurance policy

570
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
that an organization is essentially

571
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
buying

572
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
to buy themselves time in the event of a

573
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
bridge to notify users and then to

574
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,159
notify users you know so you can change

575
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,080
their passwords uh before that they're

576
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
exploited on other sites

577
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
and then

578
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,039
when we also talk about password uh

579
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,120
threat modeling

580
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
we talk about how the threat modeling

581
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,640
for password

582
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,120
for user password uh

583
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,799
creation

584
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,480
should assume that every site stores

585
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,280
their passwords in plain text right

586
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,039
so

587
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,080
these two threat models are kind of

588
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
adults with each other

589
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
so uh and you have to forgive me i don't

590
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
actually have a talk actually prepared

591
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
these are just a bunch of notes

592
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,919
so

593
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,840
um

594
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,320
do i have a what

595
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
oh

596
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
this is not

597
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
this is not a speaker request this is

598
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,240
just me being very glad that you're here

599
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,280
so i appreciate you you would

600
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
what is it

601
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,360
oh jesus yeah that's acceptable all

602
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,918
right all right

603
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,520
we want the title that's all you do

604
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
i appreciate that well cheers

605
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,400
you guys

606
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
yeah so for those who don't know i

607
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
didn't think i was going to make it this

608
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
year um

609
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,679
been like really financially strapped

610
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,440
with the demise of tara hash if anyone's

611
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,080
followed that um but someone

612
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
stepped up and said like no you guys

613
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,799
have to come to vegas so they

614
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,000
sponsored our trip

615
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
i just drove from texas with my wife and

616
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
four children we've been in the car for

617
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
four days together we just got here an

618
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,400
hour ago

619
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,200
so yeah it's been a stressful four days

620
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,980
so cheers y'all

621
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,130
[Applause]

622
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,880
that's the first shot i've taken in

623
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
three three years

624
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,919
god damn

625
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,200
all right

626
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,440
so

627
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,320
why does it taste like pork

628
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,439
was that bacon scotch

629
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,400
 man all right

630
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,039
so where even were we

631
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,919
all right

632
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,880
so no

633
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
anyway i'm saying uh i didn't think

634
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,640
we're gonna make it so i kind of stopped

635
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
working on this talk this talk was just

636
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
like a seed and then i was like oh i'm

637
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
not gonna be able to make it so i can

638
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
actually develop it so

639
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,200
um

640
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
i just got a bunch of notes here so um

641
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,400
oh anyway so yeah uh i said that uh the

642
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
threat model for password security on uh

643
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,559
on an organization side

644
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
starts with the password database being

645
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
compromised up to and including physical

646
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
theft like that's that's where the

647
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
threat model starts is password

648
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
databases compromise on the user side

649
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
it's we assume that the service provider

650
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,960
is storing the passwords in plain text

651
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,880
right so that's where we've kind of

652
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,240
assumed that the threat models were for

653
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
the past under what decade or so

654
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,559
but um

655
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,159
things are a little bit different now

656
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,039
right

657
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,840
so password hashing was invented

658
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,720
on multi-tenant unix systems

659
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
right where you could just run git ent

660
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
and get everyone's passwords

661
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,039
for you know all the users

662
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,799
and and even then you know you can still

663
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,400
get everyone's uh you know even even

664
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
with password hashing with the invention

665
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,200
of descript you can still get people's

666
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,720
descriptions encrypted passwords or

667
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,240
everyone on the network

668
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
uh we don't have that problem anymore we

669
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
don't really have

670
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
you know too many enterprise

671
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,159
multi-tenant

672
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
environments where there's multiple

673
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
users with the same shell to the same

674
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
system right even

675
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,799
in uh in a hosting context we have

676
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
virtual machines or you know containers

677
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,679
or something at that point we have some

678
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,480
kind of

679
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,520
uh isolation right you're not going to

680
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,919
jump onto you know some cloud provider

681
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,960
and run you know get ent password and

682
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,640
see all the other users for ec2 you know

683
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,840
on the machine it doesn't work like that

684
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,880
anymore

685
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,159
um

686
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,600
it's same thing with like uh

687
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,520
the way that we kind of assume for

688
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,200
password hashing that sites are designed

689
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,840
that websites and the services are

690
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,279
designed when we talk about you know

691
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,480
like oh a

692
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
vulnerability in a web app can

693
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
compromise you know the database like

694
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
yes it absolutely can

695
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,919
but

696
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,679
you know we're kind of thinking of more

697
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,679
of an old monolithic model

698
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,240
not a modern-day like you know modern

699
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,679
web app uh

700
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,919
uh like uh you know cloud native micro

701
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,080
services type architecture um you know

702
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,200
distributed

703
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
uh usually with a hosted database or

704
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,279
something like you know dynamodb or or

705
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,200
redis or something like that right

706
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,320
so um

707
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
what i want to do is this is going to

708
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
involve everybody

709
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,720
uh

710
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
where's pair

711
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,240
do you have something to write with

712
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,039
including a computer to type on

713
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,080
okay

714
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,799
we're gonna take notes here

715
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
all right

716
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,480
let's just type in english

717
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,360
i've said it to uh russian kuwait but uh

718
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
whatever you want

719
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,840
so

720
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,200
word word is perfect

721
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
yeah word perfect right

722
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,640
ctrl n

723
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,200
that works

724
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,240
okay

725
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
so

726
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
here we go

727
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
i'm gonna go first

728
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,799
we're gonna re-threat model passwords

729
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
right here on this fly i've already done

730
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,520
this i want to see if this is a group

731
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,039
come up with the same thing

732
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,360
so physical theft where are what are our

733
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,159
threat vectors for password database

734
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,720
physical theft

735
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,840
anybody shout it out

736
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,240
what's that

737
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,600
no no no we're talking about the threat

738
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
itself the threat modeling assuming the

739
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
crowd knows how to threat model we're

740
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,240
talking about we're we're enumerating

741
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
the threats right now so let's say

742
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
physical threat the first the first

743
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,960
third we hit

744
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
that's perfect yes so we have a

745
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,159
malicious insider we actually had this

746
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,600
at a company i worked for where i was

747
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,760
the director of information security we

748
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
had an employee who would replace a hard

749
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,399
disk and a raid 5 array

750
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,159
one disk every month

751
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,760
to rebuild the array taking the old

752
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,799
perfectly good drive so he could

753
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,720
reassemble the raid array at home stole

754
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,480
an entire database

755
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,679
right

756
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,840
so

757
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,678
all right so let's uh

758
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,840
oh

759
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
where is

760
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,320
left

761
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
go to left

762
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
computer left i don't know it all

763
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,200
right whatever

764
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
so

765
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,840
physical

766
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,159
theft that's a new page whatever it

767
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,880
all right so we have a malicious insider

768
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,120
right

769
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
and that could be self-hosted or a colo

770
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
provider right

771
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,240
where the hell's the dash

772
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
all right i'm just gonna hit equals oh

773
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,039
that's a zero whatever

774
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,360
okay what about in the cloud where we

775
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
have shared databases right we could

776
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
have an employee who has access to the

777
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,240
hosted database as well right

778
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
so let's say uh hosted

779
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,919
right

780
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,159
okay so taking a step up from physical

781
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,480
theft what's another threat that we're

782
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,159
combating against with with passwords

783
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,360
with the combat against passwords that's

784
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,960
not a threat to passwords

785
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,360
okay online brute force right where we

786
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,159
have a login on a web page and a user is

787
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,520
trying something

788
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
uh like hydra right to

789
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,919
enumerate uh username and password so

790
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:46,880
we'll say

791
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,760
online brute

792
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,840
okay what's another threat in our thread

793
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,760
malware okay keyloggers like it i love

794
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,919
it

795
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,520
okay

796
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,039
i heard two different things at once and

797
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,760
i'm deaf in both ears

798
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,760
oh like sql injection you mean okay

799
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,678
great

800
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,039
not great okay and what would you say

801
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,039
fishing

802
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,919
okay

803
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,200
what else do we have in our threat model

804
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,080
what was it

805
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,159
a rubber hose technique for those who

806
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,240
don't know i was a 97 echo in the army

807
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,600
that was interrogator so i love it

808
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,918
all right

809
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
backups that's great i'm actually gonna

810
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,279
put that up here with physical theft

811
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,480
goddamn right she did karen

812
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
i'm not that's also physical theft

813
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,960
because that's going to go yeah so uh

814
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,039
yeah as i put sticky note but post it

815
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,960
we'll use the copyrighted term

816
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,440
all right

817
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
how about remote code injection we have

818
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
a legitimate flaw in the application

819
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
where we're actually executing our ce

820
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
and we have access so we can read the

821
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,080
databases right

822
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,519
okay

823
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,240
i will allow it

824
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
this is a good list what was that

825
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,360
okay i like that one that's that's

826
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,639
thinking outside the box

827
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,200
was that jim fitness said that holy

828
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,519
sir how are you

829
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,880
call me a legend there's jim

830
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
fenton right there okay

831
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,080
what else do we have in our threat model

832
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
for passwords

833
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,559
default passwords

834
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,559
someone left you guys know what prop sex

835
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,440
is

836
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,039
in california you have to disclose what

837
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,320
causes cancer

838
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
so it

839
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
was oh oh i'm sorry

840
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,720
it's that bacon that's that bacon scotch

841
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,399
forgetting numbers

842
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,840
okay

843
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,439
is there any oh yes sir

844
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,039
you know what i'm laughing but

845
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,279
i can see where that is something that's

846
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,880
plausible because they sell everything

847
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
else about us right any other

848
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,120
identifiable information they sell so

849
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
why the not sell our passwords as

850
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,760
well i would buy them

851
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,080
okay

852
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,760
is anybody can you want to think of any

853
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
other threat in our threat model for

854
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200

passwords

856
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,399
okay i'm just gonna put that under a

857
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,159
generic man in the middles does that

858
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,960
work you like it awesome

859
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,339
[Music]

860
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
i'm going to lump that under man in the

861
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,519
middle because in order to exploit

862
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,960
are you talking in transit or at rest

863
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,159
so if it's at rest

864
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,120
i'm going to go ahead and say that's

865
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
covered by things like rc and physical

866
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,279
theft and if it's in transit i'm gonna

867
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,200
lump that under man in the middle

868
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,559
are we good with that

869
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,600
okay

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
this is democracy and action

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,039
okay yes sir

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,440
do people do that holy

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,720
uh oh

874
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,799
are you getting unruly

875
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,120
oh come here little man

876
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,799
this is my two-year-old malachi everyone

877
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,679
say hi malachi

878
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
malachi doesn't like passwords because

879
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,440
it prevents him from watching youtube

880
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,640
do you say hi

881
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
yeah i love it

882
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,879
hard-coded pet but no he's right

883
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,918
so

884
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,520
i'm i'm gonna say that hard-coded

885
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,280
passwords are slightly different than

886
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,199
default passwords because

887
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,079
a user is aware of a default password

888
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,918
right but a user may not be aware of a

889
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,599
hard-coded password and we see that time

890
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,040
and time again especially with network

891
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,760
devices cisco juniper they love

892
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,159
hard-coded backdoor passwords don't they

893
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,480
so i'm going to go ahead and say heart

894
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,719

anything else in our threat model before

899
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,159
we go through these

900
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,839
i'll allow it i'll allow side channels

901

if i can spell it

902
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
you see a rainbow

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,860
whoa is it right there

ask for adults though buddy

that's a daddy beverage

okay

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,839
i know it is a rainbow it's a beautiful

all right

912
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,119
shoulder surfing you know what i will

913
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,119
allow that too i'm gonna put that under

914
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,440
physical

915
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
how physically you have to be the

916
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,599
shoulder surf depends on the user

[Music]

920
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,599
you're right you're right so the

921
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,440
password is cracked

922
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,920
probably on another site right

923
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
so i'm going to go ahead and say that

924
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
that's covered by

925
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,200
password reuse and the event that that

926
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,560
password is breached on another site and

927
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,119
cracked and then credential stuff

928
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
right and then for ones that aren't i'm

929
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
going to say that's covered by online

930
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
brute force right is that fair is there

931
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,240
anything i'm missing there i'm just

932
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,520
being i'm just being fair i may be

933
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,000
missing something this bacon scotch is

934
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
 with me

935
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,839
yes sir

936
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,040
a tempest attack

937
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,119
okay does everyone know what a tempest

938
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,000
attack is all right thank god all right

939
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,520
it's a side channel that's actually

940
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
where i was going too

941
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,320
you are correct but side channel sir oh

942
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,640
yes sir in the back

943
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,118
what is it

944
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,400
a candy bar

945
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,839
like you give him a candy bar for the

946
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,040
password yeah no i'm gonna put that

947
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
under phishing or social engineering or

948
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,520
something there uh i like it though i

949
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
like it yeah and there's also uh we had

950
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
this one here too right the the uh

951
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,359
buying the passwords right or selling

952
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,240
the passwords

953
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,520
buddy i'm gonna have to hide this from

954
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
you

955
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,760
okay all right

956
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,359
all right

957
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,440
so is everyone comfortable with the

958
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,520
threats in our threat model

959
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
yeah all the possible threats to

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
password security

961
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,240
all right

962
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,839
here's what we're gonna do and you're

963
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,119
not gonna be happy about this

964
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,599
put on a helmet because i'm about to

965
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,440
blow your mind okay

966
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,200
now

967
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
for the militia for the for the physical

968
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
threats right because remember i i even

969
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,000
said

970
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
i'm in like ink in a book saying

971
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,280
that

972
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,119
password security starts with you know

973
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,960
physical with with the password database

974
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,000
being compromised that's where the

975
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,520
threat model starts

976
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,400
and i'm telling you i was wrong

977
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,640
tell me where length

978
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,200
and complexity will defend against any

979
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
of these

980
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,839
who can think of

981
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,400
one scenario for physical theft

982
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,240
or length and complexity matter

983
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,520
oh shoulder surfing

984
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,560
clever

985
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
so you're

986
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,240
you know what i'm gonna put an x next to

987
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,359
that one

988
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,800
potentially yes if you're trying to

989
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,920
shoulder surf someone and they have a

990
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
ridiculous god awful you

991
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,040
password

992
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
you'd have to be like rain man to pick

993
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
that up right so

994
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
that's true they got they got the they

995
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,320
got the the

996
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
they got the yeah they got the unified

997
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,160
camera in the corner recording it so um

998
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,400
but you're right you you are right that

999
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
is a potential mitigation for shoulder

1000
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,640
surfing is make your reach your password

1001
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
so complex no one could possibly

1002
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
shoulder surf it

1003
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
so i like that all right

1004
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,880
i will accept that

1005
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,440
okay now let's go down to online brute

1006
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,839
force

1007
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,240
now keep in mind

1008
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
have any of you actually performed

1009
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,560
online brute force

1010
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,440
okay

1011
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,079
how fast did it go

1012
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
slow

1013
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,400
extremely slow right

1014
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,280
okay

1015
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
so in order to make online brute force

1016
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,960
practical you pretty much have to have a

1017
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
botnet or some sort of distributed

1018
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,720
infrastructure and that's assuming they

1019
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,640
don't do rate limiting or account

1020
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,960
lockout right they do rate limiting

1021
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,720
now you have to also have like you know

1022
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,400
a different ip address trying like you

1023
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
know a handful of attempts to try to

1024
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,599
slide under the radar right it's not

1025
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,920
easy to online brute force your

1026
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,599
guesses for online brute force have to

1027
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,280
be highly targeted

1028
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,920
right so i'm gonna argue

1029
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
that length and complexity are rather

1030
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,280
irrelevant for online brute force

1031
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,119
because for online brute force

1032
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,240
you're either trying a credential list

1033
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,400
or something really really dumb

1034
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,440
like company name one summer 2022 right

1035
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,560
does everyone agree with that if you

1036
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,119
even have a moderately complex password

1037
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,960
it's probably not gonna get cracked by

1038
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,839
online brute force

1039
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,920
okay key loggers does length and

1040
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,839
complexity defend against key lockers in

1041
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,050

so

1061
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,880
i'm gonna go ahead and start by

1062
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,720
prefacing this saying that

1063
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
modern web app frameworks

1064
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
have made sql injection less and less

1065
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,960
prevalent does anyone here do pen tests

1066
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,200
like daily

1067
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,359
how often do you find sql injection now

1068
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,079
compared to five years ago

1069
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,680
more and more rare right in fact on the

1070
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,000
o loss top 10 it's fallen from number

1071
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,640
one where it sat for ever to

1072
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,240
number three

1073
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,000
right it's not even just sql injection

1074
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,160
that's all injections they finally woke

1075
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
up and lumped all injection attacks

1076
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,440
together because they basically are the

1077
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,880
same attack

1078
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,960
it's injecting different things right i

1079
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,280
might be injecting php in this

1080
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,000
attack or injecting you know uh sql in

1081
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,040
this attack but it's all

1082
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,480
injection you know even cross-site

1083
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,319
scripting is just you know javascript or

1084
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
html injection right so

1085
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,480
they lumped all injection together

1086
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,800
and it's fallen number three so modern

1087
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
web app frameworks are it's not obsolete

1088
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,960
don't get me wrong it's just harder to

1089
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,640
 up and code sql injection today

1090
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,960
than it was five years ago and obasa has

1091
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,240
shown this it's falling from number one

1092
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,359
number three

1093
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,720
right

1094
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,000
and i'm also going to say too with

1095
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,720
today's distributed architecture

1096
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,520

1097
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,839
the web app processing

1098
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,800
may not and in fact likely are not the

1099
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
same ones that handle authentication

1100
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
depending on the size and complexity of

1101
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,359
the app

1102
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,920

1103
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
password geeks

1104
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,640
think about this we think of a

1105
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,480
monolithic application running on one

1106
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
server but that just really isn't the

1107
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,560
truth especially for you know anything

1108
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,220
even remotely complex these days

all right

so

1127
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,240
keeping the things i just said in mind

1128
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,640
sql injection may or may not yield

1129
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,640
password hashes or it may yield

1130
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,200
only password hashes right and not the

1131
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,040
user's data that's part of the

1132
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,280
application or

1133
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,160
it may yield everything right not just

1134
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
the password hashes but all the data

1135
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,839
that the user has stored in the

1136
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,839
application thus making the password

1137
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,040
hash is less attractive because you

1138
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
already have all the data that's inside

1139
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,800
the app in the database right so it's

1140
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
basically three different vectors here

1141
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,400
for sql injection we have sql injection

1142
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,599
why is there no dash on your keyboard

1143
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,440
where do you hide which region

1144
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,359
where's the dash

1145
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,880
how can i do sql injection without a

1146
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,920
dash english but still

1147
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,800
oh it's down there

well now it's american so now you've got

me there that's what i've been hitting

1150
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,880
before i can't give me zeros okay

all right thank you pair up now you have

the us layout i love you buddy okay

1153
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,839
so we have

1154
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,720
sql injection

1155
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,440
with

1156
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,359
hashes

1157
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,839
and i'm gonna say

1158
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,000
sqli with

1159
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,760
hashes

1160
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,200
plus

1161
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,520
plus you said it was the american layout

1162
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
this is not the freedom layout

1163
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,200
all right uh with user data

1164
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:49,839
and all right

1165
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,400
sqli

1166
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,000
uh what did i say with that

1167
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,119
without ashes

1168
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,920
but with data

1169
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,040
all right so

1170
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,640
in the event of sql injection with

1171
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,160
hashes

1172
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,599
there is a chance of course that length

1173
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,720
and compact and complexity could in fact

1174
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,520
you know uh mitigate this attack right

1175
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,240
so we'll put an x there

1176
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,119
in this scenario where we have both the

1177
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,880
hashes and the user data it does

1178
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,319
all nothing for the most part right

1179
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,680
and then without hashes but with data of

1180
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,640
course it doesn't matter if you have

1181
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,599
links in complexity because all the

1182
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,880
data's been compromised you know you

1183
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
have hashes to crack all right

1184
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,079
all right

1185
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,119
fishing

1186
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,880
does length and complexity matter for

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,720
plausible deniability

1194
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,400
all right you know what i'll allow it

1195
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,560
i'm gonna put one slash

1196
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,319
that's half an x for plausible

1197
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,319
deniability

1198
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,359
where you're going with that though is

1199
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,000
kind of where i'm going with this so

1200
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,520
yeah so i'm giving half a slash but no

1201
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,359
you're right but that's kind of where

1202
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,960
i'm going okay so

1203
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,760
remote code execution if you have rc on

1204
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,839
a system

1205
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,599
in that case like that that goes back to

1206
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,280
what my original threat model was right

1207
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,640
where password hashing becomes the

1208
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,319
insurance policy

1209
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,880
right where now we're trying to you know

1210
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
uh have a strong password hashing

1211
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,119
algorithm to buy time for us to notify

1212
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,480
or identify the breach contain the

1213
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,160
british notify users and users have time

1214
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,280
to be notified and update their

1215
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
passwords and like that right

1216
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,160
but

1217
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,960
if you have rce on a box you can just

1218
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,119
attach to the process

1219
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,960
and read the passwords in plain text as

1220
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,400
they're being submitted right you can

1221
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,079
sniff them from memory you can scrape

1222
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,520
them from memory

1223
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,760
or you can sniff them over the wire

1224
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,200
you know like there's a lot of different

1225
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,599
vectors here that password hashing just

1226
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,200
doesn't defend against

1227
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,079
right

1228
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,400
so for the most part if someone has

1229
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,480
arbitrary code execution

1230
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,000
length and complexity don't defend

1231
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,040
against that in any way

1232
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
password reuse does length and

1233
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
complexity defend or mitigate against

1234
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,839
password reuse

1235
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,400
no oh

[Music]

1237
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,760
okay so you're getting psychological now

1238
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,200
no no that's that's fair that's fair

1239
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,000
okay so

1240
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,720
um

1241
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,920
users who are inclined to create short

1242
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,160
passwords are also therefore more likely

1243
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,839
to be the users who use that same

1244
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,440
password everywhere

1245
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,839
that's the argument

1246
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,839
i will accept that argument i will

1247
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,000
counter argue that what happens in

1248
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,720
reality is you end up with password bang

1249
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,760
facebook password bang twitter you see

1250
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,119
what i'm saying

1251
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,200
yeah and i i it pairs done a lot of

1252
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,880
research in that regard as well i think

1253
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,040
you agree with that that it tends to be

1254
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,800
you're still reusing the same password

1255
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,079
you just have your own password system

1256
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,200
you know what i'm saying the people who

1257
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,640
have their little systems for their

1258
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,079
passwords it's really it's the same

1259
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,680
 password you just put some

1260
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,960
different on the end for each

missed and i'm like i'm right here

still have 1600 miles to go

all right no that was really funny nice

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,920
to meet you

okay

[Music]

1275
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,280
i'm gonna put a question mark here for

1276
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,960
debatable

1277
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,800
all right supply chain

we have some piece of malware that's

1279
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,160
been slipped in upstream and we don't

1280
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,760
know about it not scraping our users

1281
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,200
passwords

1282
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,720
which lethal complexity doesn't

1283
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
defend against does it

1284
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,440
all right default passwords legally

1285
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
doesn't defend

1286
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,800
the service provider's selling your

1287
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,240
passwords because why the wouldn't

1288
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,240
they when they sell everything else

1289
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,720
doesn't defend man in the middle

1290
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,480
it doesn't defend

1291
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,400
hard-coded passwords that's a little bit

1292
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,760
different because and check it didn't

1293
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,520
select that password right

1294
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,559
but

1295
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,760
like let's say we're talking about a

1296
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,119
system with like

1297
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,839
you set the world's most longest and

1298
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,280
complex password for the root password

1299
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,640
you're like oh no one can get in but

1300
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
then someone's like cisco one two three

1301
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,960
and they get in right you know so yeah

1302
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,880
no totally i mean yeah like it didn't

1303
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,520
defend against that did it side channels

1304
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,200
maybe

1305
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,160
i'm going to say that length and

1306
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,240
complexity could maybe defend against

1307
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,440
the side channel

1308
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,119
maybe

1309
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,400
depending on how reliable the side

1310
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,240
channel is if it's a flaky side channel

1311
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,480
a shorter password probably has more of

1312
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,839
a chance to be caught than a longer

1313
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,359
password right

1314
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,319
so

1315
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,640
maybe

1316
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,559
that was it that was everything we came

1317
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
up with okay

1318
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,720
now

1319
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,760
we have the threats

1320
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,680
and we have the risks and we have the

1321
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,359
mitigations

1322
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,839
out of all of these things

1323
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,960
does length and complexity matter

1324
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,119
what is the one thing that would defend

1325
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,480
against all of this

1326
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,160
can anybody name it

1327
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,000
the

1328
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,960
okay

1329
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,680
the second thing

1330
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,040
unique passwords

1331
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,880
unique

1332
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,760
my proposal now is that the only

1333
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,359
thing that matters with regards to

1334
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,680
password security is not length

1335
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,319
not complexity not anything else not

1336
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,720
emojis not any other not even the

1337
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,240
underlying password hashing function

1338
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,319
because again as a user our threat model

1339
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,520
assumes that

1340
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,960
the service provider is storing the

1341
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,319
passwords in plain text right

1342
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,680
so

1343
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
i propose that the new threat model for

1344
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,240
password security is that the only one

1345
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,558
thing that matters is uniqueness

1346
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,480
you want to sit on a table

1347
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,559
oh thank you brother you're the best

1348
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,400
oh that's really cold that's really good

1349
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,520
man

1350
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,280
give that kid a raise

1351
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,240
okay so oh

1352
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
okay so let's break down that scenario

1353
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,440
okay so this scenario is let's say we

1354
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,720
have

1355
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,760
a way

1356
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,920
to crack or gain access to a person's

1357
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,040
password we log into the server

1358
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,319
sure right right right

1359
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,960
okay congratulations you've gotten one

1360
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,079
user out of all my users

1361
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,079
right so

1362
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,960
even with and i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm

1363
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,160
gonna i'm gonna address something that

1364
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,680
we also don't really talk about in the

1365
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,280
password space

1366
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,480
password

1367
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,720
strength is an unsolved problem

1368
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
we have not solved the problem of how to

1369
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,359
measure password strength how to measure

1370
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,680
how strong a password is we already know

1371
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
that shannon entropy is right

1372
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,880
we're not creating

1373
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,359
encryption keys oh it's fine let it die

1374
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,839
let it die

1375
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,240
no we're not creating shannon entry has

1376
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,359
nothing to do with passwords we

1377
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,880
typically measure passwords in terms of

1378
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
key space but even then key space is

1379
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,720
irrelevant if the key space is one

1380
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,319
because it's in our dictionary

1381
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,280
right

1382
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,800
so

1383
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,040
we have yet as of 2022 this is like a

1384
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,280
 millennium prize problem

1385
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,920
is how to measure

1386
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,480
the strength of insecurity of a user

1387
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,480
created password a machine created

1388
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,800
password is easy we can do easy math on

1389
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,319
that assuming the source of random is

1390
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,440
sufficiently random which

1391
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,280
where's the scotch

1392
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,040
but you know

1393
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,760
but as far as a user created string we

1394
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,359
have no way of measuring there's been

1395
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,520
some really novel approaches some really

1396
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,680
cool shit's been done in the space but

1397
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,000
none of us really actually solved that

1398
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,720
problem so even if you try to implement

1399
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,880
some kind of control

1400
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,680
you know to defend against the creative

1401
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,440
user who creates

1402
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,200
a you know variation of summer 22 that

1403
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,359
bypasses all the complexity checks and

1404
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,119
meets the minimum length requirements

1405
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,599
right like

1406
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,720
there has to be some kind of margin of

1407
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,880
error for human stupidity and human

1408
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,400
creativity

1409
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,680
because password restraint is an

1410
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,880
unsolved problem

1411
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,680
now the best way to solve that is to get

1412
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,440
rid of passwords

1413
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
which fido 2

1414
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,640
is

1415
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,078
pretty well poised to do that

1416
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,759
thank you water fairy

1417
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,799
okay

1418
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,319
so

1419
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,880
do you agree

1420
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,079
no

1421
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,599
no

1422
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,960
all right one to center all right does

1423
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,000
anyone else have a rebuttal

1424
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,079
go ahead

1425
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,200
okay so let's talk about so um

1426
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,880
when i say the only required the only

1427
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,960
request that matters is uniqueness right

1428
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,480
so what i'm saying what i'm proposing is

1429
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,920
that shifts

1430
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,480
the threat model for users

1431
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,280
to basically just be password managers

1432
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,200
right where we have a password manager

1433
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,119
creating a unique password for each one

1434
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,880
of our sites and services so we don't

1435
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,000
have

1436
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,880
users creating passwords we have unique

1437
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,480
passwords that are being generated and

1438
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,680
created for every every service right so

1439
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,680
does that clarify that so we don't have

1440
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,119
users really creating dumb passwords i

1441
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,119
think that addresses both things

1442
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,480
so

1443
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,880
because that's the path to unique right

1444
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,079
the path to unique is to remove humans

1445
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,400
and our dumb squishy predictable brains

1446
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,760
from the password creation process

1447
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,000
entirely

1448
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,480
yes sir

1449
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,799
it doesn't

1450
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:01,839
so you're right it doesn't defend

1451
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,760
against all of them

1452
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,359
but that was also a really unique one

1453
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,119
that i hadn't considered but it's also

1454
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,520
highly plausible

1455
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,200
so

1456
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,359
oh the question was how does having a

1457
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,280
unique password defend against a service

1458
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,960
provider who's actually selling your

1459
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,559
passwords

1460
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,240
you know and when i first went through

1461
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,559
this threat model by myself i had not

1462
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,079
considered that that was not in my

1463
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,160
threat model but i think it's highly

1464
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,079
plausible because again they sell

1465
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,400
everything else about us why would they

1466
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,559
not sell passwords and people like me

1467
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,839
would buy them

1468
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,599
i wouldn't harpy if

1469
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,280
twitter put up a thing like

1470
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,599
you know to the ad networks to like you

1471
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,359
know i had partners been like

1472
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,319
this data set includes you know username

1473
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,559
email address plain text password

1474
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,839
 sold take out a second mortgage

1475
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,200
am i wrong no

1476
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,839
so hit me up

1477
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,559
twitter they'll probably bury it in a

1478
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,880
new hula now they will

1479
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,079
exactly

1480
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,240
usually use one of any clue yes

1481
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,558
sir

1482
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,350
no

1483
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,440
[Music]

1484
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,680
account one password

1485
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,839
right so each and every account that you

1486
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:18,640
have

1487
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,400
you create a new password for and the

1488
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,480
only way to do that is essentially with

1489
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,240
a password manager to manage all that

1490
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,960
for you

1491
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,559
no

1492
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,839
there's no reason to change your

1493
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,119
password if you don't suspect it's been

1494
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,520
compromised right and as we went through

1495
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,200
the threat model

1496
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,400
the threats of compromising the password

1497
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,839
a lot of those things the password

1498
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,559
itself is irrelevant right

1499
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,520
so

1500
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,280
changing isn't going to do anything for

1501
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,880
90 of things in the threat model

1502
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,280
of course

1503
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,760
that's right you can yes it's like your

1504
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,839
own little canary so basically what he

1505
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,760
said is if you're using a unique

1506
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,920
username and a unique password like free

1507
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,079
site and service you now know who gets

1508
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,839
breached based on what spam you receive

1509
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,440
the different email addresses right or

1510
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,040
what if you have blackmail attempts or

1511
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,640
things like that right you know

1512
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,480
because you're only using one set of

1513
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,400
credentials for one side or service

1514
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,920
it's like your own little canary out

1515
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,839
there so

1516
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:30,078
all right does anyone have anything else

1517
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,040
no oh oh oh oh

1518
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,640
to manage your oh manager

1519
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,480
you do you do so i'm gonna very very

1520
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,920
quickly address this because this is

1521
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,839
again this is all this is that i

1522
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,280
put out on twitter

1523
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,520
like 25 times a month to where i'm blue

1524
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,480
in the face and like

1525
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,160
you're right so you have your password

1526
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,359
manager which generates all your

1527
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,839
passwords for you except for your

1528
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,200
master password for your password

1529
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,559
manager in which case you have to commit

1530
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,920
that to memory right and that's most of

1531
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,359
the grievance of people on twitter who

1532
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,200
are like it only allows 30 characters

1533
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,599
for my password holy how insecure

1534
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,960
like

1535
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,520
unless you have to create a password you

1536
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,880
have to commit a memory for that site

1537
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,160
and service it doesn't matter

1538
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,160
your password only has to beat the 12 or

1539
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,240
13 characters long for me not to crack

1540
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,280
it

1541
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,160
right

1542
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,640
so then for your master password right

1543
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,559
your password manager is employing a

1544
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:25,920
proper

1545
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,760
key derivation function

1546
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,839
that is slow as

1547
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,559
and

1548
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,079
and

1549
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,319
i'm not going to be able to try

1550
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,559
you know my usual

1551
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,760
you know 750 billion guesses per second

1552
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,920
against your master password i'm just

1553
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,240
not without incurring massive expense

1554
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,799
and are you worth it

1555
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,880
do i want to expand that kind of you

1556
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,760
know

1557
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,240
capital just to crack your password you

1558
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,480
know are you important enough for that

1559
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,720
like i'm not demeaning you good sir i'm

1560
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,640
sure you're perfectly

1561
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,359
upstanding human being i love your smile

1562
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,839
but you know i'm not gonna drop five

1563
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,760
million dollars to crack your password

1564
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,720
i'm not you

1565
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,319
so

1566
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,200
yeah

1567
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,720
for your password manager master

1568
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,400
password which employs a proper key

1569
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,559
derivation function you don't have to

1570
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,440
have anything that strong even a seven

1571
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,359
character random password which is easy

1572
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,119
to remember will be pretty

1573
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,240
secure

1574
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,400
if it's hashed with like you know

1575
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,480
argon 2 with an insanely high number to

1576
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,720
where your you know run time is like you

1577
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,440
know greater than 1000 milliseconds

1578
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,400
right

1579
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,799
so it's simple stuff once you saw once

1580
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,400
you bring it down to this level password

1581
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,119
security becomes easy you know

1582
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,040
like it's like you know mom and dad can

1583
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,319
do it type

1584
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,920
all right one more thing and then i'm

1585
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,200
gonna concede the mic to the people who

1586
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,759
want to clear the room

1587
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,559
how will hsm factor into this

1588
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,799
so

1589
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,880
on a service or a user level or at a

1590
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,839
organization level

1591
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,760
on a user level i would say an hsm

1592
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,880
wouldn't play much of a difference but

1593
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,799
on a service provider level assuming you

1594
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,960
have good secrets management right for

1595
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,960
the hsm like you don't even have to do

1596
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,480
expensive password hashing in that case

1597
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,160
you can just do an hmac with a key

1598
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,079
that's stored in the hsm and it doesn't

1599
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,440
matter if the password has released

1600
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,480
because i don't have the key in

1601
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,720
the hsm right so i'm never going to

1602
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,160
crack those passwords um

1603
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,000
does that answer your question

1604
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,280
awesome

1605
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,599
all right

1606
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,040
so since no one else has any strong

1607
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,319
disagreements i'm going to say i win

1608
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:45,839
all right

1609
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,160
thank you guys

1610
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,839
good to see everybody going after three

1611
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,599
years and i'm really not sure what to

1612
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,039
say now it's like jeremy i

1613
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,160
you don't disagree with me i

1614
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,760
yeah but i really enjoyed doing this

1615
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,119
conference and suddenly i don't see the

1616
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,520
point anymore it's uh

1617
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,760
thank you passwords but make it nihilism

01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,559
continue to do pastorscon because it

1621
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,440
seems

1622
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,839
pointless now

1623
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,160
thank you jeremy uh i have no further

1624
