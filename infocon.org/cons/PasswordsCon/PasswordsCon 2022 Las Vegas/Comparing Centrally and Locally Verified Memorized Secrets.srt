1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
then it's uh two minutes passed and uh

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,359
i do guess that quite a few people still

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,040
out for lunch

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,519
uh but i'll next because jim fountain uh

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,559
for those uh who knows jim he needs no

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,400
introduction and for those who doesn't

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
need no gym

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,279
he's

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,119
he's just amazing and he will introduce

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
himself uh and i'm looking forward to

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,840
this one as usual jim so please go ahead

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
thank you very much pear

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,760
um so those of you that have been at

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
passwords con

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,120
just this morning may have already

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,879
picked up on this if you've been a your

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
passwords con regular you you know the

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,239
pair likes to have kittens on all of the

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,600
slide decks

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
and my kitten is a little bit different

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,120
it's a little bit pricklier than most

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,199
kittens i i don't think my talk is

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
necessarily prickly but it was just the

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
picture that i had

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,239
so i'm going to talk about um

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,799
i'm and i'm going to use kind of the the

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,760
formal terminology memorized secrets and

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
the difference between

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
the way that we usually deal with

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,960
passwords and such uh that are stored

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,479
centrally like

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,200
you know for logging into something uh

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
and those that are that are used

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
increasingly now

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
for activating a multi-factor

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
authenticator

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
so i'm going to start with my usual

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
disclaimer

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
i'm a consultant for nist and i'm

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
working on the revision of special

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,920
publication 863

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
which uh deals with user authentication

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,119
and there's another volume on identity

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
proofing and another volume on

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
federation

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,439
but everything that i'm talking about

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
here is my own opinion it's not i am

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
not a nist employee i don't represent

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
nist at all

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,200
um

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,920
but

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
some of the things that i'm talking

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,719
about here you may recognize uh if if

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
and when you look at the the new draft

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,399
that we hope will be coming out

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
not too far in the future

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
but remember that everything it's that

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
what what's coming out next is a draft

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
and uh

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,200
everything is subject to change in the

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,079
review process

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
uh and and by the way i

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,800
this

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
treats me very well and makes me feel

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
like member of the family and i have a

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
tendency sometimes to refer to nist as

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,519
we

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
and um just

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
remember that it's just because they've

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
they've made me feel welcome i'm not

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,840
i'm not really a nist person

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
so

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,920
i get hung up on terms a lot um and so

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
here's a few of them um memorized secret

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
is kind of the formal term that we used

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,319
in 863 revision three

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,920
uh in order to

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
get away from the notion of password

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
versus passphrase yes i mean

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
if it's a if it's a password can i have

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
a space in it of course it can but um

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
i just didn't want to uh

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
to uh

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
necessarily limit the the scope of of

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
what we were talking about

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
and i've thrown past key in here and our

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,519
next talk is on past keys so that's kind

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,920
of a kind of a preview

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
of that

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
um

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,760
but and and i apologize for the

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
wordiness of this slide i just kind of

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
like cut and pasted some definitions

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
that i had

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
um

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
a couple of of things that may be new

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
definitions new terms for you is what

98
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,519
what i'm referring to is an activation

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
factor

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,239
and that's when you've got a

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
multi-factor authenticator

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
and you uh

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
need something in order to

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,799
uh you need a second factor in order to

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
use that authenticator

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,840
that second factor could be

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,640
a

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
memorized secret

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,200
and it could be a biometric

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
an activation secret

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,879
is the specific case where it's a

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
memorized secret and that's really where

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
i'm going to

114
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
focus this afternoon

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
is on

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
activation secrets

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
and how they compare with

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
what we might think of as

119
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
conventional or traditional passwords

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
and

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
what what their requirements should be

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,800
now one of the things i'm going to

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
actually go off slide for for a minute

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
here one of the things that we did in

125
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,360
the previous revision of 863 we did you

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
know all sorts of things that people

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
have have noticed about

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
memorized secrets

129
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
recommending that they not be

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,479
subject to expiration

131
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,160
recommending that you not have

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,960
composition requirements and so forth um

133
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,840
but

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
we kind of lump together

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
what i'm now calling activation secrets

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
with memorized secrets and applied

137
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,600
many of the same requirements

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
to activation secrets as other sorts of

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
memorized secrets and

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,479
in retrospect

141
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
uh i think

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
we we could have done better with with

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,039
activation secrets um

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
so

145
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
here's here's here's what i'm talking

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,639
about here and uh it's used to activate

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
a multi-factor authenticator so

148
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,520
examples of multi-factor authenticators

149
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
are things like

150
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
uh phyto tokens are things like smart

151
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,639
cards

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,680
um

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
but they can also be embedded

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
authenticators where

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
your um

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
uh it could be you know an an app in a

157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
mobile device or something like that as

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
well

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
um

160
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
in the case of uh an activation secret

161
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
you can actually use that in order to

162
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
derive

163
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
the authentication secret you can

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,000
essentially

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
if you will encrypt the authentication

166
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,039
secret with using the

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,960
the activation

168
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
secret as a key i realize it's not a

169
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,199
very long key

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
but we've got some other mitigations for

171
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
for the the link that i'll be talking

172
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,960
about

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
usually the activation secret is

174
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,280
something that's selected by the user

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,360
uh there are some exceptions to that if

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
you get a

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
an atm card sometimes the bank will

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
choose a pin and

179
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
maybe give you the option to to change

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,600
it

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
but usually selected by the user and

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
that has a big effect on

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
the

184
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,319
um guessability of of the activation

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
secrets

186
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
and usually the activation secret if

187
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
you've got an authenticator like a phyto

188
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
token

189
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,720
is uses the same

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
activation secret for everything

191
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,319
that that's uh that that that token uh

192
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,280
is used to authenticate at so it's it's

193
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
one activation secret per

194
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
authenticator rather than per site that

195
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
you authenticate at

196
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
which means there's less to remember

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
now

198
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
this is this is where the uh the the

199
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
real differences come in between

200
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,199
activation secrets and other sorts of

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,880
memorized secrets

202
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,759
um

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,919
the first one the first threat brute

204
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,400
force is really the same for both

205
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,199
um

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
you know an attacker can

207
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
just just try and and guess either make

208
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
an intelligent guess or a dumb guess

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
and

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
that can be done just as well with with

211
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
an activation secret

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
but a lot of the other

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
threats are different

214
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
um

215
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
in the case of of a centrally stored

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
memorized secret uh it's often involves

217
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
the the cracking of

218
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
some sort of a centralized

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
authentication database that got x

220
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
filtered somehow

221
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,919
um whereas with the activation secret

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,680
we'd be thinking since it's stored in

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,759
the authenticator itself or or in the

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
endpoint in a few cases um it's really

225
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,919
you're thinking about the physical uh

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,599
attacks on that

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,680
and and possible side channel attacks

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,759
you know is there some way that you can

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,799
maybe buy the um radio frequency it

230
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,240
emits or maybe by the uh

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,599
current drain

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,799
those sorts of side channels might be

233
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,838
possible for a

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
multi-factor authenticator

235
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,120
shoulder surfing actually is is similar

236
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
to both although in the case of an

237
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
activation secret it's really shoulder

238
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
surfing plus

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
they steal your authenticator so

240
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
uh you know if you're at the if you're

241
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,279
at the subway station

242
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,640
and you're

243
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,519
typing in your pin on your phone to to

244
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,480
authenticate somewhere um be aware of

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
your surroundings because that might be

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,040
a situation where you'd have a combined

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
attack where somebody watches you do

248
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
that and then grabs your phone

249
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
and then of course for for for regular

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,680
passwords there are you know password

251
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
spraying attacks uh

252
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
because people have a tendency to use

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
the same passwords in on multiple sites

254
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
uh so perhaps the same one that you used

255
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,399
on some service that got breached might

256
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,920
also be usable for your bank account

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
whereas for activation secrets

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,880
again

259
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
it doesn't matter if it's the same

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,360
activation secret for multiple sites um

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
instead we're we're kind of thinking

262
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
more about other sorts of forensic

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
attacks you know

264
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,200
sometimes if it's a pin and there's some

265
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,480
sort of a

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,040
dedicated keyboard for it maybe their

267
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
particular

268
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
keys that we're down more quickly or if

269
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,040
somebody's very sophisticated maybe

270
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
after you've authenticated maybe certain

271
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
keys are warmer than others

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
so in order to take this into account

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
there are a few

274
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,120
dimensions a few different factors that

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
we can

276
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
uh address

277
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
about uh how an activation secret should

278
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
be constructed and how it should be uh

279
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
how it should be used

280
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,519
um of course is the composition question

281
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
uh what characters

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
uh the length of it

283
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
uh the uh

284
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
uh

285
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
the the throttling i mean we

286
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
i mentioned earlier about the the fact

287
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,399
that there are

288
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,079
uh that uh brute force attacks are a

289
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,320
significant threat for both

290
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
activation secrets and regular passwords

291
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
and so the throttling is a is a very uh

292
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,519
significant counter measure to that

293
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,360
and and also block lists

294
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,839
so um in most cases

295
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,480
um uh activation secrets tend to be pins

296
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
and and in fact sometimes people equate

297
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
pins with act with uh

298
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
with uh activation secrets uh i don't

299
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
tend to use that term because they

300
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
aren't always numeric in fact uh for a

301
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
for a fido token i can change my

302
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
activation pin

303
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,200
to abcdef

304
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
and it's just fine with that as long as

305
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,959
i'm using an endpoint that has an

306
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,320
alphanumeric keyboard i can use that

307
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
so

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,079
since pin stands for personal identific

309
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,279
personal identification number

310
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,560
this is

311
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,839
an instance of where i get hung up on

312
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,279
terminology i try not to use that

313
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
because i don't want to equate

314
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
a

315
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,279
multi-factor authenticator that uses a

316
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,240
a memorized secret for activation i

317
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
don't want to necessarily say that that

318
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,200
has to be numeric

319
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
uh but given that they are mostly pins

320
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
the the use of a pin of course just

321
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
limits the entropy that you can get

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,000
and the and the uh

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,959
the

324
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,959
activation secrets are usually very

325
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,839
short

326
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
like four to eight digits

327
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
for being by far the most common

328
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,760
but uh you know you do see examples of

329
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,360
well and you see on people's phones

330
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
i think apple has has pushed people to

331
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
use more digits

332
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
and

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,480
so that's

334
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
uh

335
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
you know

336
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
i think that's going to increasingly

337
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,639
happen

338
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
one of the things about length though is

339
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
that there's

340
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
you you might think that

341
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,120
a six digit pin is one and a half times

342
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
as good as a four digit pin

343
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
and it's not necessarily because there

344
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,480
are different patterns that show up

345
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,079
when you use a

346
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
a six digit pin

347
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
with four digit pins

348
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
particular years like maybe a birth year

349
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,600
or a marriage year or so forth show up

350
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,920
with more regularity than

351
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,440
other rent other random numbers with a

352
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
six digit you get uh dates so you get a

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,000
lot of

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
you know uh

355
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,000
0 9 1 1 0 1 or something like that

356
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
that

357
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
aren't necessarily

358
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
random as well

359
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
and so just just because of the fact

360
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
that different

361
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
lengths of

362
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,639
uh activation secrets

363
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
lend themselves to different patterns

364
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
you get

365
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,279
uh different amounts of uh

366
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,199
you don't necessarily get exactly what

367
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,600
you might expect in terms of the uh

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
benefit from

369
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,519
uh having a having a longer

370
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,480
activation secret

371
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
now nist recommends using a block using

372
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,480
a block list

373
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,720
on memorized secrets

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
and um

375
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,360
you know the idea is to avoid having

376
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,160
people use things like paris license

377
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
plate

378
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,120
or one two three four five six or or

379
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
things of that sort

380
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
as a memorized secret

381
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,800
and

382
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
kind of the same recommendation

383
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,360
carries through to activation secrets

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,399
just because

385
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,079
there are there are common values that

386
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,600
you're pretty

387
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
clear that you don't want to

388
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
allow and i give some examples down at

389
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,360
the bottom i think those are the the

390
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,839
most common ten pins down there zero

391
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,160
zero zero zero one two 3 4 and so forth

392
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
the the difficulty with block lists is

393
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,360
that some authenticators have a very

394
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
have very limited storage

395
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
to

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,279
keep track of

397
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,639
a list of

398
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,480
activation secrets that it shouldn't

399
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
allow

400
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
and unfortunately

401
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
small block lists don't provide as much

402
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,519
benefit as you would like to have

403
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,440
part of the part of the issue there is

404
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
that attackers

405
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,199
will also know what what the block list

406
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,360
is it will they will know that zero zero

407
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,079
zero zero isn't allowed for this type of

408
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
authenticator for example

409
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
and

410
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,759
so they won't try it

411
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,360
and so essentially what you're doing is

412
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
you're cutting off the

413
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
the beginning of the

414
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
probability distribution and just

415
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
scaling everything up a little bit it

416
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,720
ends up looking

417
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,880
very much like the original probability

418
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,600
distribution

419
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,279
but nevertheless

420
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,040
we recommend

421
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,839
there's that we

422
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,480
again recommend

423
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
including a block list

424
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,240
more more than 10 if you can but we

425
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,880
recognize the practical limitations of a

426
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
lot of existing authenticators

427
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
those 10 values that you're looking at

428
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
there

429
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
constitute

430
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
about 14 and a half percent of the

431
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
pins that people would randomly select

432
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,839
given given an unconstrained choice

433
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
there's a i'll have a reference at the

434
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
end to this uh

435
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,839
website from amateur

436
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,720
he did an interesting experiment where

437
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
he put a

438
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
an app in the

439
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,639
in the app store that did something else

440
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,639
i forget exactly what it was but it also

441
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,279
prompted for somebody to set a pin in

442
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,560
order to

443
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240
to secure it and

444
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,240
he kept track of the the uh he collected

445
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
uh quite a number of uh

446
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
of pin values

447
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,000
and uh was able to as a result do some

448
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,919
research on

449
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
uh pin distributions at least until he

450
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
got kicked out of the app store because

451
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,799
they discovered that

452
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,959
and the next dimension is is throttling

453
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
and throttling is can also be a problem

454
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
on

455
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
multi-factor authenticator

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
because

457
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
what you'd like to do is you'd like to

458
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,520
slow the attacker down

459
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,880
without necessarily

460
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,640
cutting off entirely because you don't

461
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
you know sometimes

462
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,640
somebody will

463
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,880
fat finger their pin

464
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
a few times

465
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,679
and

466
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,679
you don't want them to be necessarily

467
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
locked out so what you'd like to do is

468
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,880
to

469
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,120
slow things down or give some warnings

470
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
or something like that that says uh

471
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
you know don't uh you know be careful

472
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
the next time you type it in because

473
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
this is your last choice or something

474
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,760
like that well you can probably do that

475
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
warning but you can't do the actual

476
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,919
slowing down because

477
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
many of these standalone authenticators

478
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,760
don't have a clock reference there isn't

479
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,960
any

480
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
they don't have a sense of time and they

481
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
don't have any way of storing the state

482
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
information about when the last bad

483
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
attempt was

484
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,559
smartphones will often do this but

485
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,559
you know if you've got something like a

486
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,200
a phyto token or a smart card that plugs

487
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,799
into something else

488
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,679
it's a little bit more problematic

489
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
so as a result there's and even even

490
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
when there is time based time throttling

491
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,559
there is a hard lockout

492
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
after a certain number of bad tries

493
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
and

494
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
the difficulty is that the limit needs

495
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
to be small like 10

496
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,799
if the activation secret is short it's

497
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,280
kind of a trade-off there between

498
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
making the activation secret

499
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,400
longer more you know higher entropy you

500
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
can you can tolerate a higher

501
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,240
a higher

502
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
limit

503
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
but the one of the problems here is that

504
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,039
you have this risk that you're

505
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,320
essentially going to brick your

506
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,120
authenticator at some point

507
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,039
if you've

508
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
so

509
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,000
the the message here is and i think this

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,679
is a general message not just for

511
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,919
multi-factor authenticators is

512
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
have a have a backup authenticator

513
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,720
because this is not something where

514
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
if your authenticator locks up

515
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,400
you can necessarily call the it help

516
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
desk and have them

517
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
have them fix it for you

518
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,720
now some some authenticators do have

519
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
a second

520
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,559
password update key

521
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,880
it's essentially another a second pin

522
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,799
that the it department or somebody can

523
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
use in order to reset your authenticator

524
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
uh

525
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,120
other authenticators like fido don't

526
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,799
basically would you have

527
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,720
your the the choice that you have with a

528
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
with a

529
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,799
fido multi-factor authenticator is that

530
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,360
you basically need to reset it

531
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
and re you know as it goes kind of goes

532
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,440
back to factory

533
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,320
factory reset mode

534
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
um

535
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
so

536
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
do do have that extra authenticator

537
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
that's you know maybe in your

538
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,280
closet or some other secure place that

539
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,080
um

540
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,000
you can use if if that happens

541
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
so any in any case this throttling is

542
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
very important if you don't do this

543
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
there's really

544
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
nothing to prevent an attacker from that

545
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
gets a hold of your multi-factor

546
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,520
authenticator nothing that prevents them

547
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400
from

548
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
going in and just trying

549
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,240
all 10 000

550
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,440
possible pins if necessary in order to

551
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
uh

552
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
in order to try and uh get into your

553
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
accounts

554
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,840
so kind of my overall message is that

555
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,080
activation secrets have a lot of

556
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,360
different characteristics they have a

557
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
different threat model they have

558
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
different structure you might say well

559
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,440
gee if i have a 16 character password

560
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
shouldn't i also have a 16 character

561
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
activation secret

562
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,280
hopefully i've expressed to you why that

563
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
isn't necessarily the case

564
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,679
uh in fact most i i don't think i've

565
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,280
seen any

566
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,039
multi-factor authenticators yet that

567
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,559
will accept

568
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,559
all 16 characters and we have a visitor

569
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,960
hello i'm damon i'm on the program

570
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,919
committee

571
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,640
and

572
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
so when you apply we have this tradition

573
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,559
you can make an outrageous speaker

574
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,720
request okay i believe your outrageous

575
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
speaker request is i just don't think

576
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
i'm creative enough to make an

577
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,780
outrageous speaker request

578
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,080
[Laughter]

579
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
so

580
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,080
allow me to please present to you

581
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,200
this book from john cleese on creativity

582
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
the shortened cheerful guide

583
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,880
for the dedication from all of us here

584
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,799
at these sites

585
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,559
thank you for everything you do for our

586
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,480
community and for being part of this

587
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,559
event thank you very much that's very

588
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,039
nice oh this this looks fun

589
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,840
and i i

590
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
and i love john cleese's stuff so i will

591
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
i will treasure this book thank you very

592
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
much that's this is great

593
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
this looks like a good book okay i won't

594
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,799
read it right now

595
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,120
so um

596
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,720
you know the capabilities of uh

597
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,120
let's see i'm

598
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,080
activation secrets

599
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,320
ought to be considered a little bit in a

600
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,120
different category and i'm hoping that

601
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,799
in the next version of 863 we'll be

602
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,840
recognizing that in a better way

603
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
and you know authenticator capabilities

604
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,799
are uh you know

605
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,400
vary from

606
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,159
authenticator to authenticator so you

607
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
know look at look at some of these

608
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,280
things like what's what's the

609
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
the number of retries that you're that

610
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
you're a lot the number of attempts

611
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,080
you're able to make and

612
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,919
and

613
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
size of uh activation secrets and all of

614
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
that sort of thing

615
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,159
and then a couple of references here

616
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,880
this first one here on the security

617
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,279
smartphone unlock pins is just really um

618
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,200
kind of the bible on this subject in

619
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,279
terms of

620
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,840
how people

621
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
choose unlock pins they've

622
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
gone sort of done some reverse

623
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,799
engineering of of iphones to see which

624
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
pins iphones don't necessarily like as

625
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
much

626
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
and a lot of research and and i've had

627
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,360
some offline conversations with this

628
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
team as well

629
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
because they've done a lot of research

630
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
on sort of the trade-offs between

631
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
a number of

632
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
attempts that should be allowed

633
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
and

634
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,600
size of pins and block size block lists

635
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,760
and all of that sort of thing and

636
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,279
that was the kind of the basis for some

637
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,440
of the comments that i made earlier and

638
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
then the second one is the uh

639
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,919
the the website that

640
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,640
tells you about the most common iphone

641
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
passcodes and tells you a little bit

642
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,520
about how he collected that data

643
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,840
and that's all i have any questions

644
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,960
any questions for jim

645
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,279
um a fair amount of uh

646
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,679
smartphone authenticators allow the user

647
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,400
to

648
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,679
actually

649
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
activate with biometrics instead of a

650
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,120
pin

651
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,320
is there any advice on that any

652
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
well yeah that kind of goes into the

653
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,400
into the broader category of activation

654
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,279
um

655
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,200
uh factors

656
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
uh and

657
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,000
uh yeah i mean the biometric methods are

658
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,960
great i mean the uh

659
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,159
i think that the current uh

660
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,440
uh

661
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
false accept rate which is the the

662
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,799
metric for the security of those of

663
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,960
current false acceptor rate is on the

664
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
order of between one and a thousand one

665
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
and ten thousand i think the face id is

666
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
expected one in ten thousand

667
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,919
the difficulty that i have and

668
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,000
why i always need to have

669
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,799
an activation secret as well is because

670
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,320
if i want to unlock my phone and i've

671
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
just been doing the dishes or i've

672
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,640
unlocked my phone and my hands are dry

673
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
because they're dry and dirty because

674
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,559
i've been working in the garden

675
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
it doesn't my

676
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
fingerprint reader doesn't work

677
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,840
if i'm wearing my mask my face id

678
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,640
doesn't work so um

679
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,360
you know biometrics are great as a as a

680
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,440
as another means to do it but i think

681
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,799
that

682
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,799
activation secrets are still going to be

683
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,600
an important thing

684
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,840
thanks

685
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,880
um

686
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,960
you said that you're consulting for for

687
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,919
this even though you're going to work

688
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,240
for them and you mentioned that

689
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,559
some of the items here might be

690
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,840
in in the final draft so just curious

691
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
what are the recommendations you're

692
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,840
providing to nest for the 800 sp 863

693
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,880
that currently isn't in there

694
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
uh well i mean the current

695
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
the current recommendation treats

696
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
activation secrets with

697
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,480
in the same category as other sorts of

698
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,720
memorized secrets

699
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
there is a

700
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
little bit of a special case there for

701
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,760
numeric act numeric memorized secrets

702
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
that are randomly generated by the

703
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
verifier

704
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
but it turns out nobody actually does

705
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,799
that and so really the new the new

706
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,760
treatment of activation secrets is in

707
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,799
order to

708
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,840
come up with some uh guidelines that

709
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,200
are

710
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,600
uh really intended to be

711
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,159
more generally applicable and and

712
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,200
actually

713
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
deal with some of the differences that

714
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,399
were that i've talked about in this talk

715
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
that answer your question

716
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
otherwise talk to jim jim afterwards we

717
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
have to move on thank you again jim

718
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,120
and just stay put because now we are

719
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,200
heading straight for christian brown

720
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,240
from google to talk about passkeys and

721
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
after that we're also doing the uh

722
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,039
panel on all things fido where we have

723
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,440
both fido alliance we have microsoft and

724
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,559
we have google up here if you have any

725
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,559
questions related to that you can ask

726
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,640
that while we go ahead with the pound

727
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,120
discussion you can tweet at me if you

728
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,200
want on twitter and i will ask the

729
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,919
question anonymously on your behalf

730
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,679
but prepare your questions for that

731
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,000
and while chrysalis getting ready

732
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,200
i can do some of my old jokes like

733
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
my ex-wife is probably

734
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,679
the woman in the world who knows most

735
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,679
against your password about passwords

736
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,240
against your own bill

737
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,200
a pin walks into a bar and the bartender

738
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,840
says what

739
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,120
you're too short to be here obviously

740
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
yeah um

741
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,200
i i i have a little uh

742
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
thing with christian um

743
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,320
i was doing pastorscon in stockholm in

744
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,559
2018.

745
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,880
i was incredibly happy to see that

746
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,960
christian from google

747
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,799
submitted the talk he wanted to come and

748
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,000
talk about

749
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,559
fido stuff

750
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,200
and being the person i am i was thinking

751
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,320
about well

752
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,240
so christian is coming to talk about

753
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,960
fido and uh you know i've been up and

754
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
down talking about fidu before as well

755
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,320

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,120
christian to scandinavia to stockholm

757
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,399

so i created a t-shirt

759
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,679
uh saying what do we still have in 10

760

783
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,480

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
do here is go through

792
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,240
um a little bit of background on like

793
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,080
what we've been doing you know i think

794
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,919
that uh presentation is officially

795
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
titled like you know where we are where

796
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,399
we've been and where we're going um and

797
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,200
then we'll lead into a q a with a panel

798
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,039
where some of my uh other colleagues on

799
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,360
the fighter side will join me um if

800
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
folks have any any questions and we can

801
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
have a healthy discussion uh before we

802
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
get into that though i just want to make

803
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,679
sure that i have

804
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
my

805
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,080
logistics figured out i am planning to

806
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
do a live demo which is always a lot of

807
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,919
fun especially for the people in the

808
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,640
audience when it doesn't work um so i

809
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
think we're good i think we've got

810
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,200
everything ready and when we get to that

811
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,559
part of the presentation hopefully we

812
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,559
should be able to to do that without too

813
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,320
much trouble uh i'm gonna plug this into

814
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
just want to make sure don't want to set

815
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,559
up my keyboard now

816
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,000
and hopefully we should be

817
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,120
good to go all right excellent cool um

818
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,799
can folks still hear me if i'm walking

819
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,440
around here no let me clip this on my

820
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,399
t-shirt over here

821
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,440
let's see if that's better is it okay

822
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,360
folks in the back all right excellent

823
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,919
great okay um so again i'm christian and

824
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,799
we're going to be talking a little bit

825
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,880
about pass keys today so let's start

826
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,559
with why we're doing this work right

827
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,559
what is the reason why we got involved

828
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,880
in this in the first place um back in

829
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
2009 um google suffered a

830
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,519
um an attack uh very similar actually to

831
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,360
what has happened just two or three days

832
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,880
ago with some other vendors um basically

833
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
google got finished right um there was a

834
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,200
phishing email phishing message someone

835
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,519
clicked on it uh gave away credentials

836
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,360
and hey you know someone got into the

837
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,880
system um and that same thing happened

838
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,000
recently and it still happens and it

839
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,720
really is because passwords are so

840
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,120
incredibly easy to fetch right it is so

841
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
trivial in tricking a user into

842
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,919
revealing their secret data the thing

843
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,000
that is supposed to make them unique so

844
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,679
easy for them to reveal that to you know

845
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,480
some other resource um and and to be

846
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,559
quite honest it's much easier to set up

847
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,720
a website and exploit phishing than it

848
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
is to exploit you know uh i guess the

849
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,519
inherent protection in systems today

850
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,960
that come as a result of malware

851
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,279
protection right um if we think back

852
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,039
like a number of years ago if you look

853
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,760
at this graph right back in 2012 2013

854
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
2014 the way that you would pop someone

855
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,000
is by getting malware on their system um

856
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,840
no one does that nowadays right for two

857
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,600
reasons phishing is super easy to pull

858
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,360
off and secondly operating systems have

859
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,080
become much better at isolation um and

860
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
just in general at keeping bad and

861
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,840
unwanted software out apple app store is

862
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,720
one way you know very curated google

863
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,480
play store kind of similar and even on

864
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,919
other desktop operating systems the

865
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,360
operating systems will become much much

866
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,679
much better at ensuring that bad

867
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,240
software and unwanted software stays out

868
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
so phishing is the one thing that we

869
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,519
want to protect against uh back to the

870
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,240
the this short history here 2009 uh you

871
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
know this stuff happened and we vowed

872
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
that we don't want phishing and

873
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,279
credential phishing to ever be a problem

874
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,960
for google enterprise users or google

875
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
internal users again um

876
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
and that's really where our journey the

877
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,840
google journey started um towards the

878
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,880
stuff that i want to talk about here

879
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
today which is uh fido and and fast keys

880
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
and web will then um so we wanted to

881
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
find a solution to this problem so a

882
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,200
bunch of different companies got

883
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,559
together right this isn't an exhaustive

884
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,120
list this is a couple of names uh of

885
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,480
folks that's part of this thing called

886
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
the phyto alliance and i'm sure folks in

887
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,679
this audience have probably all wrote

888
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,200
about the photo alliance it's a bunch of

889
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,799
us that came together and we said hey we

890
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,399
want to solve this problem uh we have

891
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,640
this fishing problem um we have

892
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,079
usability problems we've got other

893
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,520
problems we want to you know band

894
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,960
together and we want to try and address

895
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,679
this uh problem going forward

896
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,480
and what we came up with is something

897
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,719
called and in the next slide you'll see

898
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,159
a little bit of a different explanation

899
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,440
of this but we came up with something

900
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
called web of n web authentication uh

901
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
and it's w3 says w3c worldwide web

902
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,480
consortium specification

903
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,159
that allows

904
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,040
developers or web developers to interact

905
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,839
with

906
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,199
security hardware and security

907
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,879
implementations on platforms and we'll

908
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,159
talk a little bit more about what that

909
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,159
means in a second but basically there's

910
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,119
the worldwide web consortium uh who has

911
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,280
the specification for a lot of this work

912
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,359
and then there is the fight of alliance

913
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,679
which is the organization um in which a

914
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,320
lot of us operate together and and and

915
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,918
kind of like came up with some of the

916
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,200
work that ultimately led to the

917
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,760
specification in the w3c and a different

918
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,079
representation of how that work and how

919
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
these things are related to this graphic

920
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,320
here essentially you have fido and 502

921
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,079
photo 2 is kind of like this overarching

922
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,839
thing this umbrella

923
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,359
you know terminology that sits at the

924
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,160
top and then inside of 502 you have a

925
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
web specification which is how a

926
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
developer would interact with fido's

927
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,960
stuff um you know if you write a website

928
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
essentially you'll deal with whatever is

929
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
in the w3c webothen specification

930
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,560
that's kind of like on the right-hand

931
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,599
side here

932
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,640
and then if you are a vendor that makes

933
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,880
physical security keys right that's

934
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
stuff that we'll talk about in a second

935
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,160
that's part of what we've done in fido

936
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
physical security keys was the first

937
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,960
instantiation of uh fido hardware and of

938
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,880
the solution this phishing resistance

939
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,240
solution which we'll talk about but

940
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,599
essentially if you're an authenticator

941
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,760
vendor um then you deal with the

942
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,520
standard that sits under the fido

943
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,839
alliance which is called ctap client to

944
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,839
authenticator protocol for most of us in

945
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,119
this room if you're not an authenticator

946
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,160
vendor if you're not interested in

947
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
making physical keys you can ignore most

948
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,920
of the part on on the left there but

949
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
what is way more interesting is

950
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,960
recently we've decided that not only

951
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,040
will we under the fido umbrella be

952
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
supporting physical external security

953
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,280
keys things that a user has to buy and

954
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,400
carry and that they can use to

955
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,560
authenticate but we will also support

956
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,720
built-in authenticators so stuff that's

957
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
already inside of the platform that can

958
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,640
make the platform act and get all of the

959
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,119
benefits of a fido authenticator

960
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,320
these are things like fingerprint

961
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,359
sensors the screen unlock of the device

962
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,040
face recognition so there's a lot of

963
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,160
this technology that has been in devices

964
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,040
ever since the advent of the iphone 5s i

965
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
guess which is the first real consumer

966
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,800
device with a fingerprint on it i mean

967
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,079
before that we had some desktop and

968
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,520
laptop systems but it never really took

969
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,040
off this is the first time that became

970
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,880
mainstream and when we saw that we were

971
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,520
like hey it would be cool to allow

972
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,440
developers to get access to that

973
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,599
hardware with all of the features and

974
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,119
all of the benefits that fido

975
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,720
authentication provides

976
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
so we'll talk about that

977
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,680
so if we look at a quick timeline here

978
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
right we started off with the physical

979
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
removable security key back in 2009 when

980
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,359
google had our issues when we said hey

981
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,160
we never want to get finished again we

982
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,640
designed a protocol which is basically

983
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,880
what ended up becoming u2f together with

984
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
some other folks that work with us in

985
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,720
fido but u2f universal second factor was

986
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,119
the first instantiation of fido uh and

987
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,280
that is where you use a physical device

988
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,440
most of the time a usb device that has

989
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,359
some key material on it when you want to

990
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,119
sign into a system you present this key

991
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,960
material and then the way that the

992
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,440
protocol is constructed the the

993
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,680
authentication sequencing is is phishing

994
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
resistant so it means even if you're

995
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
tricked into going to a website that's

996
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,040
not really the real google or the real

997
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,960
microsoft or the real facebook the

998
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,720
security key will not reveal its secret

999
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,160
and that was kind of like one of the big

1000
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,720
benefits of of moving into this fighter

1001
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
world because if you look at other forms

1002
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,720
of multi-factor authentication um pretty

1003
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
much none of them except for smart cards

1004
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,240
have the inherent phishing protection

1005
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,320
that fighter devices have so fighter

1006
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,480
devices brought back in the blue kind of

1007
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
side on the left it brought um

1008
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,640
phishing resistant multi-factor

1009
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,400
authentication to the masses into the

1010
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
web but we still needed users to go and

1011
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,640
buy physical security keys and you know

1012
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,960
we knew that that had a a very limited

1013
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,320
kind of like

1014
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,560
usable segment there um and then we went

1015
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,160
on and we said well it's really cool now

1016
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,520
that the iphone 5 has fingerprint

1017
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,800
sensors and android's fingerprint

1018
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,880
sensors and nowadays on laptops and

1019
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,960
other devices uh we have like windows

1020
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
hello which is a mechanism for doing

1021
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
biometrics on the device what if we

1022
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,480
could tie that same technology into fido

1023
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
and we can essentially expand from only

1024
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,119
users who buy physical keys to a world

1025
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,920
where anyone that has a hardware that

1026
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,400
has these capabilities can also benefit

1027
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,040
from phishing resistance fido

1028
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,359
as kind of like a an additional factor

1029
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,800
we'll talk about that in a second so

1030
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,920
that's kind of like stuff that we've

1031
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,119
done back in 2017 2018 um lately we've

1032
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,359
added support for other uh you know

1033
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
purpose build flows for example there

1034
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,200
are certain types of financial services

1035
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,520
regulation that came out in europe uh in

1036
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,480
the us we see a lot of a specific type

1037
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,920
of credit card transaction security

1038
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,079
that's needed stuff called 3d secure so

1039
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,760
we were working together with these

1040
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,119
other uh

1041
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,359
bodies essentially in saying what can we

1042
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,839
do to take fido support that we have and

1043
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,160
bring it to more and more use cases so

1044
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
not traditional authentication but other

1045
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,440
types of specialized authentication uh

1046
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,000
flows as well for example payment flows

1047
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
um and and you know that was all great

1048
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,680
but we still had a problem we still have

1049
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,280
this adoption problem where fido was

1050
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,200
kind of like for a minority

1051
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,640
fighter was for users with physical

1052
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,520
security keys fido was for users or

1053
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
developers who

1054
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,599
really added fido as an additional

1055
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,920
option over and above passwords but it

1056
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,079
wasn't really closer to getting us rid

1057
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
of passwords completely it was still one

1058
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
more option you could use if you think

1059
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
back to the biometric authentication you

1060
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,359
have in your phone today right if you

1061
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
have a banking app on your phone most of

1062
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,119
the time you open the banking app uh you

1063
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,400
know you sign in with your username and

1064
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
your password and then you up step into

1065
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
biometric authentication the next time

1066
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,280
you come back now you can use your

1067
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,040
fingerprint but the moment you buy a new

1068
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,400
device you're back to password

1069
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,760
authentication so you're never getting

1070
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,520
rid of passwords you're really adding

1071
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
biometrics and adding capabilities in

1072
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,839
order to make authentication easier and

1073
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,760
more user-friendly but you're not

1074
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,800
getting rid of the security downsides of

1075
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
having a password attached to that

1076
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
particular account and that's really

1077
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
where pass keys came in which isn't

1078
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,839
really a

1079
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,839
different specification or a different

1080
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,319
technology it is taking what we have in

1081
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,640
fido when we're both in and applying it

1082
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
in a certain way where we can actually

1083
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,319
finally start

1084
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,079
hopefully getting rid of passwords

1085
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,280
completely

1086
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,040
and me winning that bet with per and

1087
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
getting a bunch of beer so let's talk a

1088
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
little bit about that in a second here

1089
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
security keys the fob this is the use

1090
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,359
case we had first right users go sign in

1091
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,880
somewhere you type your username you

1092
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,400
type your password you pull out your

1093
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,240
security key you plug it into the drive

1094
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
and hey you're magically authenticated

1095
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,640
not really a you know a better user

1096
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,800
experience than using passwords uh you

1097
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,480
one can argue that it's maybe better

1098
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,640
than you know having to use sms otp in

1099
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,319
terms of usability or better than having

1100
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,480
to use push because it's easy and the

1101
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
device is already maybe a new usb port

1102
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,920
that you just tap it but it was

1103
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,000
definitely an improvement in security

1104
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,280
but it wasn't really an improvement

1105
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
usability and it certainly didn't get us

1106
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,440
closer to getting rid of the usability

1107
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,240
issues regarding passwords um platforms

1108
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,760
indicators is the thing we did next you

1109
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,599
know as we can see here we saw these

1110
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,599
things start to appear in more and more

1111
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,680
devices fingerprint sensor on laptops

1112
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,000
phones uh you know laptops there on the

1113
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,680
left-hand side in terms of the of the

1114
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,800
camera you know facial recognition um

1115
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,280
and with that we were able to build some

1116
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,680
interesting web experiences and this is

1117
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,280
a gif that should play there we go you

1118
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,200
should see this uh working here this is

1119
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,800
for example you can see we're on our

1120
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,680
website right you're on

1121
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,920
accounts.google.com and you're trying to

1122
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,160
do something where we need additional

1123
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,240
assurance that it's you in the past we

1124
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
would have asked you to enter your

1125
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,359
google password here we say just touch

1126
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,800
your fingerprint on the system and we'll

1127
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
authenticate you not really that

1128
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
groundbreaking because apps were able to

1129
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,520
do this you know since the iphone 5s but

1130
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,359
finally with web authent we brought

1131
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,119
these experiences to the web so we

1132
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,760
allowed web developers to also make use

1133
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,680
of the inherent technology built into

1134
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,400
these platforms uh and we had a bunch of

1135
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,720
relying parties or developers supporting

1136
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,640
these flows paypal had some

1137
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,240
implementations ebay had some yahoo

1138
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,720
japan entity docomo and google and a

1139
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,640
bunch of others um

1140
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,960
so actually um i saw an email this

1141
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,440
morning a colleague of mine

1142
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,079
sent me a screenshot of a yahoo us

1143
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,839
account that actually has a similar

1144
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
functionality here as well so now i can

1145
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,960
probably start removing the jp

1146
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,200
designator there under the yahoo side

1147
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,119
because it looks like we're still seeing

1148
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,160
more and more adoption of this type of

1149
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,000
workflow but like i said this is a

1150
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,760
usability improvement right it's not

1151
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,599
necessarily a security improvement if

1152
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,839
your finger is wet as jim said earlier

1153
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,280
you still get the fallback right you can

1154
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,960
cancel out of this flow and always opt

1155
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,640
for still typing your password there is

1156
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
no reason why you can't go back to that

1157
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,400
what we wanted with fido and ultimately

1158
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,079
with webothin is we wanted to move

1159
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,520
beyond the password we want to end up

1160
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,760
with accounts that don't have passwords

1161
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,839
they might not even have user apps so

1162
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,599
the big question is how do we get from

1163
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,599
here which is where we were into that

1164
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,200
role and that's really what we'll be

1165
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,800
talking about here so i had a problem

1166
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,640
with fido adoption as i said right

1167
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,960
problem is usability right limited

1168
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,560
consumer awareness and usage of security

1169
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,960
keys um you know i can tell you about

1170
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,560
the statistics there but as you can

1171
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,960
imagine it's not like we see all google

1172
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,640
users using security keys i mean we

1173
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,920
can't even get all google users to use

1174
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
usb so i mean and there's there are

1175
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,160
certain types of uh initiatives and

1176
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,440
things that we have where we're trying

1177
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,359
to push more users to take more

1178
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,520
ownership of account security but it's

1179
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,800
hard when that entails physically buying

1180
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
something and carrying yet another

1181
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
device so we have that challenge

1182
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,160
second one is uh you know challenges

1183
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,359
with patreon authenticator as a second

1184
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
factor um even as a first factor like i

1185
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,400
said we never got rid completely of the

1186
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
password we just gave you another option

1187
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,319
and it's great to have more options but

1188
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,760
that doesn't really change the security

1189
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,280
paradigm of the security model all that

1190
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
much um and then the last one as i said

1191
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,960
like high barrier to adoption for users

1192
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,520
who need to opt-in to usb i mean we

1193
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,359
can't even get users to opt into usb how

1194
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,680
do we up them into using technology that

1195
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,160
entails an additional step or two or

1196
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
three steps and you know having to carry

1197
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,599
around physical devices and also to

1198
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,359
other stuff so these were the problems

1199
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,040
and these were really the final limits

1200
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,599
back before we started uh in in this uh

1201
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,920
engaging in this pesky uh rel

1202
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,560
um so what is baskey well pesky is a

1203
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,720
password replacement that is safer

1204
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,280
easier and faster to use passkey isn't

1205
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,640
the brand it's not supposed to be

1206
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,880
capitalized it's now it's like passwords

1207
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,560
right you just say hey i have a password

1208
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,280
i have a pass key um the idea here is

1209
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,000
that this is a word which the industry

1210
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,839
can kind of coalesce around it's not an

1211
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,359
apple brand it's not a google brand it's

1212
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,880
not a microsoft brand it's not a fido

1213
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,440
brand it is just a pass key

1214
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,520
which is very very similar to a password

1215
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,839
and hopefully in the user's mind um we

1216
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,880
can start to create this concept of

1217
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,359
yesterday i use passwords today and

1218
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,680
tomorrow i'm going to be using aposky

1219
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,560
and and we can start to um essentially

1220
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,640
help users with the user journeys and

1221
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,880
the changes in user behavior that will

1222
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,640
be needed to support the transition

1223
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,160
capacities and that's what we'll be

1224
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,359
talking about here for the next couple

1225
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,040
of minutes

1226
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,160
so the capabilities that we get um and i

1227
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,760
stole these slides shamelessly from

1228
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,960
andrew's deck thank you andrew um so the

1229
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,359
the capabilities that you get in a pass

1230
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,280
key world what is different from

1231
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,440
wimbledon yesterday and fido to pass

1232
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,160
keys today well the first one is

1233
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,760
remember that problem that i said you

1234
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,680
know it's great if you have an app and

1235
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,880
you type in your username and your

1236
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,480
password and it up steps you into

1237
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,480
biometrics but the problem is tomorrow

1238
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,160
when you buy a new device you're right

1239
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,240
back to typing your password again well

1240
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,880
what if we can remove that restriction

1241
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
what if we can give you a fido key the

1242
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,680
moment that you register your biometric

1243
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,160
for a certain app let's say i open my

1244
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,079
bank of america take an example i open

1245
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,680
my bank of america app on my phone i

1246
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,040
open the bank of america website on my

1247
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,960
phone or my laptop i sign in with my

1248
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,800
credentials username password and they

1249
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,280
give me a photo key pair um i didn't go

1250
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,560
into that details i'm assuming that

1251
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,160
folks here kind of like have a basic

1252
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,000
understanding of what's going on beneath

1253
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
you know the layers of fido but

1254
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,920
essentially when you get a fido when you

1255
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,599
do a fido registration when you register

1256
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,040
your security key or whether you

1257
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,720
register your platform authenticator

1258
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,319
your fingerprint sensor or your facial

1259
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,640
recognition on a certain website or to

1260
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,400
an app a public private key key pair

1261
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,319
gets created the private key stays on

1262
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,160
the device and the public key goes to

1263
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,520
the website right so that's kind of like

1264
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,160
how fido works back in the day earlier

1265
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,480
on fido private keys were protected on

1266
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,839
the device only we have a physical

1267
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,200
security key the private key is on the

1268
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,960
device it stays there when you register

1269
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,480
it on your phone or your laptop the fido

1270
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,640
private key stays on the laptop what if

1271
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,520
that restriction didn't exist what if we

1272
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,040
could take that private key that you

1273
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,880
have on your phone and we could

1274
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,640
replicate it to all your other devices

1275
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,240
that you own as well kind of almost like

1276
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,920
what a password manager does today right

1277
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,680
password manager wouldn't be super you

1278
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,440
know useful if it only ever kept your

1279
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
password on one device and you couldn't

1280
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,400
get it off right password manager is

1281
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,599
useful because your passwords are

1282
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,359
available wherever you need to use it so

1283
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,640
what if we take that property when we

1284
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,040
apply it to fido keys so when you

1285
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,960
register a fido key and you make a new

1286
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,800
fido key for a service on your phone

1287
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,720
we're able to take that phytokey and

1288
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,160
replicate it and bring it to other

1289
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,920
devices that you own as well now of

1290
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,200
course if you're a student here you'll

1291
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,480
immediately say well how do we know you

1292
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,760
own those other devices what if it's an

1293
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,200
attacker and that's the type of thing

1294
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,280
that we want to get to later in our in

1295
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,040
our panel session but essentially if

1296
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,839
we're able to know that you own two or

1297
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,599
three other devices let's just

1298
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,280
proactively go and put your fido keys on

1299
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,119
there as well what that means and what

1300
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,200
that looks like is when you move and you

1301
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
buy a new device you go buy a new phone

1302
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,720
you never have to fall back to typing a

1303
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,800
password ever again you'll just continue

1304
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,559
to use your biometric your face your

1305
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,079
fingerprint your screen unlocked and

1306
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,760
that gets you access into that

1307
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,040
particular

1308
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
service without ever having to fall back

1309
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,359
to passwords ever again it's basically

1310
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,520
make fido as ubiquitous and available as

1311
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,599
passwords there are some caveats to this

1312
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,400
but we can get into that uh in in the in

1313
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,839
the later session

1314
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,480
the second thing is um well what happens

1315
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
if you're on a device and you just don't

1316
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,760
have your final credentials there and

1317
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,040
this is the typical password problem

1318
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,400
right the password manager problem i

1319
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
think i heard earlier folks saying like

1320
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
uh you know i have this issue where i

1321
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,520
want to sign in on my television or i

1322
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,440
want to sign in on a friend's computer i

1323
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,280
have to retype my passwords for my

1324
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,960
password manager into the keyboard to

1325
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,559
are special characters a huge pain in

1326
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,720
the ass but how do we solve that problem

1327
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,720
well the way that photo solved it is we

1328
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,599
developed a local protocol that allows

1329
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,599
two devices to talk to one another over

1330
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,760
local proximity using a specialized

1331
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,520
bluetooth protocol so essentially the

1332
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,440
use cases i want to sign in on my

1333
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,960
television i'm going to sign in on my

1334
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,359
friend's laptop i go to their laptop i

1335
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,040
click on the website i want to sign into

1336
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,880
i bring my phone close enough together

1337
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,400
which has my final pass keys close

1338
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,480
enough together to their machine i tap

1339
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
the account i want to use and magically

1340
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,200
i'm signed in no retyping of credentials

1341
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,960
totally fishing resistant because

1342
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,960
everything that is fighter related still

1343
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,040
stays intact and my credential actually

1344
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,880
never goes to my friend's machine only

1345
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,119
the signature that allows a once you

1346
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,720
sign-in actually goes to their machine

1347
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,640
over this local proximity protocol

1348
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,160
because it's not via the cloud because

1349
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,400
it's local proximity based we get all of

1350
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,000
the inherent phishing protection that

1351
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
you get out of fido in this particular

1352
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,319
protocol as well and these two things is

1353
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,920
basically the only difference between

1354
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,839
what we had an old fido and what we have

1355
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,319
a new pass keys it's fighter credentials

1356
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,160
with the ability to synchronize and the

1357
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,960
ability to be exercised remotely using

1358
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,480
these um

1359
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,960
proximity protocols that we've now

1360
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,000
defined and that most

1361
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,800
popular operating systems have stated

1362
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,880
that they will adopt so we have support

1363
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,200
for this whether you're using android to

1364
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
a mac device or whether using an iphone

1365
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,520
to a windows device these protocols are

1366
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,680
implemented in a standardized way so

1367
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,760
that it's not a vendor lock-in it works

1368
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,440
basically essential well it works

1369
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,040
doesn't matter what platform you own as

1370
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,559
long as it's a fairly modern platform

1371
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,079
and again we can talk about the exact

1372
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,319
version in there um these types of

1373
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,480
experiences is what we enable

1374
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,240
um so you know here's an experience on

1375
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,920
windows for example user goes want to

1376
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,079
sign in somewhere um sends a prompt to

1377
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,920
the phone again it's not a prompt by the

1378
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,559
cloud it's a prompt to the system on

1379
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,319
android here it's also not to an app

1380
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,480
it's to the android system and it allows

1381
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,640
you to then unlock in this case using

1382
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,040
your face here um pick the account you

1383
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,559
want to use and then over the local

1384
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,240
proximity protocol we then let the

1385
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,680
device know that yep the user has

1386
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,440
authorized this login they can go ahead

1387
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,200
and they can continue uh you know down

1388
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,440
this down this track um

1389
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,880
cross device cross ecosystem you know

1390
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,480
one mobile device can boost up another

1391
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,240
uh ecosystem or another device which is

1392
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,040
essentially um how we get away from the

1393
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,680
issue of having the user you know

1394
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,000
re-type long strings and if you retype a

1395
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,680
long string you can make an error and

1396
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,040
type it into a phishing website and

1397
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
whatever none of that is is is in effect

1398
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,559
here because everything is essentially

1399
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,240
automated between these two systems and

1400
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,319
there's a handshake so access a new app

1401
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,839
use your mobile device to sign in and

1402
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,920
then the thinking is if you use your

1403
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,000
mobile device to sign in on a new system

1404
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,760
if that's your system if that's not your

1405
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,400
friend you can create a brand new pass

1406
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,559
key on that system that signs you into

1407
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,240
the account so tomorrow if you come back

1408
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,839
on your windows machine you don't have

1409
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,280
to grab your phone again because that

1410
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,040
would be painful right you can now just

1411
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,359
on your windows machine show your face

1412
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,800
touch your fingerprint whatever you need

1413
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
to do and then get you back into that

1414
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,200
same service in an easier way so no need

1415
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,760
to fall back um you know to using your

1416
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,119
phone every single time that you want to

1417
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,880
log on on devices that you own and

1418
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,960
devices that you trust so with this

1419
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,720
let's look at a quick demo if i can make

1420
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,880
this work um this is always a little bit

1421
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,000
tricky

1422
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,880
but i'm going to try my best

1423
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,839
let's open this guy up here

1424
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,280
and essentially what i want to do is i

1425
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,520
want to show the

1426
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,480
um

1427
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,640
the experience that i just you know talk

1428
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,640
you guys through i want to show that

1429
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,280
experience in real time

1430
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,520
on my android device so let's see if

1431
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,200
we're able to make this work

1432
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,559
if everything works you should see my

1433
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,800
phone screen there in a second cool okay

1434
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
so that's always good if that part works

1435
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,200
so that is just my android phone that i

1436
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,040
have here right so i'm going to take you

1437
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,800
through a typical experience of a user

1438
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,280
here using passkeys and essentially it

1439
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,520
goes like this a user goes opens their

1440
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,680
browser and they hit you know their

1441
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,800
favorite

1442
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
banking website in this case i have this

1443
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,119
fictitious bank called tribank uh i've

1444
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,960
never dealt with passkeys in my life

1445
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,640
ever before this is my first time doing

1446
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,559
that so what will happen is the system

1447
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,880
says hey do you want to sign in ignore

1448
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,160
the sign in with a pass key button at

1449
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,440
the top for the moment let's just talk

1450
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
about the or space at the bottom right

1451
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,599
so this is a user never dealt with pass

1452
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,520
keys ever before first time ever they're

1453
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,359
going to go in they're going to type oh

1454
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,280
sorry let's refresh this make sure

1455
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,920
everything works yep user goes types

1456
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,079
username

1457
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,319
types password and hit the sign in

1458
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,440
button right

1459
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,880
now what will happen in the background

1460
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,839
is the system will detect the tri bank

1461
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
uh server side system will detect i'm on

1462
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,440
a device that supports baskets that's a

1463
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,359
silent detection mechanism we've added

1464
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,040
um and it'll offer the user the option

1465
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,559
to create what's called the passkey so

1466
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,079
there's an explicit pesky creation

1467
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,599
moment that takes place i'm going to say

1468
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,680
yep create me a passkey

1469
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,599
system ui kicks in and says hey do you

1470
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,200
want to pass me i say yeah sure i want

1471
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,280
one here's a little bit of metadata

1472
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,119
about the passkey pass keys contains an

1473
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,200
icon it contains a you know a display

1474
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,720
name it contains a username a bunch of

1475
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,480
information and it also tells me they're

1476
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,920
down at the bottom that this passkey

1477
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,280
will be synchronized to my google

1478
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,119
account in the future so if i sign into

1479
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,960
android on any other device i will

1480
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,640
actually be getting those pass keys on

1481
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,559
that device as well and then lastly i

1482
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,240
need to do a user gesture here touch my

1483
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,680
fingerprint and that creates me a

1484
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
passing so now that i have a pass key on

1485
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,680
my phone next time i come back to

1486
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,240
tribank either on this phone or on any

1487
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,599
other phone that signs into that same

1488
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,760
google account all i have to do is

1489
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,359
either now know that i have to hit the

1490
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,640
sign in with a passkey button but we

1491
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,880
know most users won't so we've decided

1492
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,559
to also integrate past these with the

1493
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,960
autofill system on the particular device

1494
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,640
that we're on so if the user were to

1495
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,079
click into the account name field here

1496
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,599
which is what i'm going to do

1497
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,200
rather than allowing me to type it'll

1498
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,480
come up and say hey you've got to pass

1499
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,680
you do you want to use that and i'm

1500
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,880
going to go yeah sure i'm going to use

1501
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,119
my pass key click it touch my

1502
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,599
fingerprint and at this point i should

1503
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,960
instantaneously be signed into the

1504
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,559
account now i mean up until this point

1505
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,720
that still makes a lot of sense um one

1506
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,240
other cool thing that i didn't say is

1507
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,319
once i made a pass key on the web the

1508
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,640
same task is also usable in an app so if

1509
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,000
i download the tribank app from the

1510
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,440
google play store i can now open the

1511
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,640
tribank app

1512
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,960
i can hit sign in with the pass key here

1513
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,040
i can click on that exact same password

1514
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,800
i created over on the web and because

1515
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,280
the app on the website is linked using

1516
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,440
asset linking i can go and just touch my

1517
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,040
fingerprint and amazingly be signed into

1518
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,720
my app as well so whether i create the

1519
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,160
pass key on the web or the app doesn't

1520
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,760
really matter they're usable in both

1521
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,559
places and then as a last um

1522
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,280
got a little uh add on to the demo is

1523
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,000
let's quickly show how the experience

1524
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,599
would work for a user that's on a

1525
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,680
friend's machine um so i'm gonna sign

1526
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,280
into tribank on my buddy's machine over

1527
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,000
here and what i'm gonna do is i'm going

1528
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,839
to go to the tri bank website so make

1529
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,079
sure it's online there we go and i'm not

1530
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,119
going to type in my username and

1531
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,400
password here i'm simply going to say

1532
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
signing with the pass key

1533
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,760
the system will detect that i don't have

1534
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,200
any pass keys yet for tribal so it's

1535
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,640
going to tell me to scan this qr code

1536
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
now the qr code is necessary just to let

1537
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,079
these two devices know that they want to

1538
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,440
be talking to one another if you have

1539
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,040
another five laptops and two phones in

1540
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
the audience here we don't want my phone

1541
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,720
to accidentally talk to your laptop so

1542
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,319
it's kind of like a disambiguation thing

1543
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,160
where i want to make sure this laptop

1544
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,599
and this phone talk to one another over

1545
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,160
bluetooth i'm gonna say use pass key

1546
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,079
there is no explicit pairing everything

1547
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,680
is handled by the protocol so i say yep

1548
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,119
i allow these devices to talk to one

1549
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,079
another

1550
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,000
the pass key i created earlier in my

1551
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,319
demo is now available on my phone i pick

1552
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,200
it

1553
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,799
touch my fingerprint

1554
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,640
and at that point in time i should be

1555
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,960
magically signed in on my laptop here on

1556
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,200
the left and as i said earlier because i

1557
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
don't have a pass key on my laptop yet

1558
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,799
the website will offer me to create a

1559
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,240
local one so next time i come back to

1560
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,839
tri-bank i don't have to grab my phone

1561
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,280
so i'm going to say yeah sure make me

1562
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,680
another pass key on my laptop

1563
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,040
i can use my fingerprint because this

1564
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,119
laptop is one of those that's equipped

1565
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,400
with a fingerprint sensor so i'm gonna

1566
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,640
touch my fingerprint and now i have yet

1567
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,319
another pass key for this website on my

1568
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,000
laptop so if i ever come back to this

1569
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,720
website on my laptop here i can just

1570
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,559
click sign in with a pass key

1571
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,880
touch my fingerprint no phone needed

1572
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,440
pick the credential that i want to use

1573
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,359
and instantly i will be signed into the

1574
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,150
account

1575
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,359
[Music]

1576
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,280
i promise i'm almost done we'll go quick

1577
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,680
recap and then i will make time for the

1578
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,920
uh for the panel here uh let's just look

1579
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
at a quick recap here so what did we see

1580
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,640
here well the first one is

1581
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,799
user info is stored on the authenticator

1582
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,240
on the registration right remember i had

1583
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,760
this promo where the website said hey do

1584
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,119
you want a pass key at that point in

1585
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,799
time i create the credential on the

1586
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,240
device it's called the discoverable

1587
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,079
credential which means metadata about

1588
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,760
the credential is associated with it on

1589
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,440
the device which means i don't need to

1590
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,880
type usernames anymore i don't need to

1591
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,799
type passwords all that information is

1592
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,280
now associated and stored on the on the

1593
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,200
particular authenticator on the platform

1594
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,760
so next time i open that website up the

1595
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,200
system can prompt me for all of my

1596
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,280
stored credentials i simply pick the one

1597
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,440
i want to use click on the one do my

1598
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,200
fingerprint scan and then basically i'm

1599
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,680
signed it um as i said the

1600
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,319
synchronization happens if i own more

1601
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,160
than one device and they're all signed

1602
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,559
into the same um into the same account

1603
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,720
we get synchronization now here's the

1604
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,319
little caveat synchronization doesn't

1605
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,799
happen like in password managers between

1606
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,359
chrome on windows to chrome on android

1607
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,720
to chrome on mac no no for fido we want

1608
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,440
low level platform support so pass keys

1609
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,640
only sync in between ecosystems owned by

1610
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,040
the same vendor so on android my pass

1611
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,960
keys made on android only sync to other

1612
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,720
android devices it doesn't sync anywhere

1613
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,359
else passkey is made on mac os sync to

1614
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,599
ipad os and they sync to ios all part of

1615
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,520
the apple ecosystem um past keys from

1616
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,839
android does not sync to ios if i want

1617
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,079
to sign in on my mac device using an

1618
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,400
android phone i need to use the cross

1619
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,880
device bluetooth flow that we saw the qr

1620
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,200
code scan flow that's how i get my pass

1621
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,760
keys or the sign-in mechanism between

1622
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,839
devices of different ecosystems and the

1623
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,680
reason why we went for that is we wanted

1624
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,440
the security properties of hardware

1625
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,520
bound and stored keys that stored

1626
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,680
directly inside of the system we did not

1627
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,359
want to have the

1628
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,280
the same issues where the

1629
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,960
private keys is perhaps just stored in a

1630
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,880
file on disk so malware can get to it we

1631
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,319
wanted the assurance of having these

1632
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,160
keys protected by the hardware which

1633
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,720
means pass keys also inherently get away

1634
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,640
from other forms of multi-factor if i

1635
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,040
have a pass key i don't need sms otp i

1636
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,319
don't need google authenticator i don't

1637
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,880
need push authentication pass keys solve

1638
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,200
two authentication factors in one single

1639
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,280
step the possession of the key and the

1640
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
way to unlock it is enough to get access

1641
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,359
to a pass key which should then account

1642
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,280
for both authentication factors in one

1643
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,040
fell swoop that's the other reason we

1644
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,799
wanted to go down the the pass key route

1645
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,960
here with the protection uh last slide i

1646
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,319
promise is and then of course the

1647
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,240
integration with autofor we don't think

1648
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,760
it's going to be successful if we have

1649
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,599
to train users to go and find a button

1650
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,599
like this on a page so we actually don't

1651
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,960
think that a button like this should

1652
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,640
even be on a page for the next five

1653
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,559
years we should have integration with

1654
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,000
pass keys directly in the autofill

1655
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,599
system so that together with your

1656
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,760
passwords we just show you available

1657
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,680
pass keys you click on it and you can

1658
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,119
sign in and if you don't have opacity

1659
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,559
available you can always go past key

1660
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,079
from a different device which allows you

1661
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,079
to pair a different phone bring it to

1662
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,160
this in proximity and then use the pass

1663
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,000
key from another device to sign in on

1664
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,599
the device that you currently own and

1665
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,200
that you're currently on

1666
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,599
um that is it i know i am one minute

1667
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,760
over um any

1668
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,119
questions i guess we can get into lots

1669
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,280
of questions afterwards

1670
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,200
thank you christian all right

1671
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,839
i i do know i have tons of questions but

1672
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,160
that's why we are doing the pal uh now

1673
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,480
so andrew and tim

1674
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,599
can also come up and join me on stage

1675
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:36,559
um

1676
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,000
and

1677
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,680
well short round of applause for

1678
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,799
christian first of course

1679
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,400
now

1680
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,079
i'm not going to say i i i know

1681
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,839
christian but we have we have met a

1682
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,280
couple of times and we have talked

1683
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,839
online as well so just still have a

1684
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,040
certain idea on on your how much of pain

1685
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,599
in the rsi can be asking questions

1686
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,599
i had dinner with him yesterday and also

1687
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,359
warned him that i like to do the

1688
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,599
difficult questions and andrew just

1689
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,359
walked straight into the trap on this

1690
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:07,790
one

1691
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,760
[Laughter]

1692
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,440
so back in norway at one of the

1693
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,280
universities there there's a biometrics

1694
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,359
lab that are rated as one of the best in

1695
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,559
the world

1696
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,040
and every time they are want to do a

1697
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,960
panel discussion they

1698
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,720
contact me because they say that i'm

1699
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,880
really incredibly good at being the

1700
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,040
devil's advocate

1701
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,000
so i wanted to start out by saying that

1702
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,040
on my phone right now

1703
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,559
i'm actually looking at a couple of

1704
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,119
slides from someone named simon youssef

1705
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,079
son

1706
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,359
at a company called ubico

1707
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,119
and these slides are actually from

1708
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,640
passwords con

1709
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,960
in june

1710
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,640
2011. oh wow

1711
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,319
in bergen norway

1712
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,119
where he was presenting the yubikey

1713
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,599
and very shortly after his talk

1714
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,760
i purchased my first

1715
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,359
yubikey

1716
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,359
and this is then

1717
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,440
11 years old

1718
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,680
so my first question is

1719
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,520
for andrew

1720
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,640
what's taking you so long

1721
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,119
thank you um how much time do we have

1722
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,200
before the next session

1723
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,839
well after this session there's one hour

1724
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,720
break okay

1725
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,680
so great question um

1726
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,520
you know i'd note that so fido alliance

1727
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,640
for those of you don't know we're an

1728
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,160
industry body

1729
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,559
over 250 companies take part uh we're

1730
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,640
fortunate enough to have

1731
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,000
all the platforms involved uh yubico

1732
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
security key vendors service providers

1733
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,200
groups like that

1734
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,319
we're coming into our 10th year of

1735
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,240
existence so this is around 11 years ago

1736
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,559
that yubago had the idea of the yuba key

1737
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,680
um i actually think we've made

1738
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,599
remarkable progress with the fido's

1739
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,200
standards well i mean christian talk

1740
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,559
about web off then web authent is

1741
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,240
supported by

1742
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,760
dozens of leading brands hundreds of

1743
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,440
millions of consumers can log in

1744
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,359
re-authenticate without a password

1745
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,119
thanks to that what we're hitting though

1746
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,280
is a point of well that's good but to

1747
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,000
really take on passwords and to have the

1748
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,079
same ubiquity as passwords we need to

1749
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,640
take on some of the same traits which is

1750
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,960
easy access ubiquitous access and ease

1751
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,000
of use

1752
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,440
and i could say like today every

1753
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,440
conversation i have about fido

1754
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,520
begins and ends with feasibility and so

1755
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,280
past past keys first and foremost are

1756
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,599
more usable means of doing passwords

1757
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,520
authentication which allows us to hit

1758
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,720
our core goal

1759
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,400
of reducing industry reliance on

1760
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,599
passwords

1761
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,200
um so i think we've made good progress

1762
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,559
in 10 years actually the fact that we've

1763
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,720
seen such adoption every meaningful

1764
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,960
company is taking part in fido alliance

1765
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,960
there's no counter standard to fido

1766
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,319
because everyone understands that this

1767
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,520
is you know

1768
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,599
fido is basically the ssl of user

1769
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,960
authentication

1770
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,640
um it's not it's not critical and i

1771
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,760
think we to have the same approach and

1772
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,520
we'll have the same success as far as

1773
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,760
being embedded in every system service

1774
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,200
and platform out there

1775
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,920
um now in regards to yubico and yuba key

1776
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,559
as christian was talking about before

1777
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,880
that's another form factor for doing you

1778
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,720
know fido authentication in fact i would

1779
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,960
say you know that will remain the gold

1780
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,960
standard from a security standpoint for

1781
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,640
fighter authentication there are certain

1782
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
use cases where a key you know will

1783
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,119
always be used that being said what is

1784
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,200
so exciting about passkey

1785
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,119
is a proposition of taking passwords out

1786
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,119
of play entirely for hundreds of

1787
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,839
millions if not billions of consumers

1788
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,200
and if someone can't get excited about

1789
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,400
that i don't know you know what they're

1790
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,440
waiting for

1791
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,720
so to answer your question i think we're

1792
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,640
making good progress taski stands to

1793
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,240
take us to the next level after this

1794
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,839
thank you um okay um

1795
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,078
tim

1796
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,920
fido

1797
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,839
u2f

1798
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,480
web authen

1799
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,319
can you explain this to my mom in like a

1800
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,680
sentence

1801
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,559
what is this stuff because my mom is

1802
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:53,680
really

1803
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,319
seriously not interested

1804
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:57,920
yeah i mean i think well you know what

1805
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,920
christian demoed um

1806
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,000
the way we explain it to folks is that

1807
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,440
you're using your screen lock on your

1808
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,920
device to sign in everywhere right

1809
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,680
that's ultimately the way we abstract it

1810
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,200
away because the same

1811
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,280
tech on the device is being used and all

1812
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,480
of the all the api service all that's

1813
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,160
completely abstract away from the user

1814
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,240
and that's why we believe having a term

1815
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,720
password pass key like password is so

1816
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,160
critical because all we need people to

1817
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,799
do is associate that as they can sign in

1818
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,240
so the way we kind of thought about this

1819
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,119
was

1820
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,240
we're about

1821
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,480
10 years into tap to pay right i think

1822
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,400
google wallet came out in 2012 apple pay

1823
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,160
was after right like most users know

1824
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,839
what that tap to pay icon means now

1825
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,440
whether it's a physical card tap or a

1826
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,200
phone we need that on the web we need

1827
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,039
that for apps so we need an icon and a

1828
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,359
name that users just know oh all i have

1829
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,319
to do is you know i'm going to get

1830
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,400
prompted to to unlock my phone more or

1831
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,799
less to do this or or my device i want

1832
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,160
to thank you that i i think

1833
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,680
up until a year ago we we weren't quite

1834
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,920
ready with this experience yet because

1835
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,079
we were always thinking a user will have

1836
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,760
to know do i have a password do i have a

1837
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,119
pass key i have to make that mental

1838
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,960
decision and that was actually a big

1839
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,880
flaw right in the in the in the

1840
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
development of this it's like users

1841
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,240
don't know today if you have a security

1842
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,359
key you need to know you have a security

1843
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,480
key because you need to have it present

1844
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,640
right the thinking with pass keys is

1845
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,400
everything is abstracted away like like

1846
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,839
with a password manager today you just

1847
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,000
go where you want to go you click into

1848
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,920
the field and whatever is available

1849
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,000
magically pops up and gets presented and

1850
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,520
until we really had that experience

1851
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,440
figured out i think this wasn't really

1852
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,280
ready for prime time but because we now

1853
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,160
have it we're hoping that it is yeah

1854
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,359
um okay uh christian um

1855
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,119
throughout the years i've seen all kinds

1856
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,000
of

1857
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,720
authentication schemes come up and fall

1858
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,119
down like that flies in in seconds

1859
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,680
i've got to be honest i do have

1860
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,839
a certain level of faith in fighter web

1861
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,599
offend but again i'm here for being the

1862
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,960
devil's advocate

1863
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,799
so i've seen

1864
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,039
facebook uh try to push two vital on

1865
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,039
location a couple of years ago

1866
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,039
and one of the things i got fascinated

1867
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,039
when facebook was really pushing to have

1868
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,440
authentication is that

1869
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,319
after enabling 2500 vacation

1870
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,480
you would get a pop-up for like every

1871
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,079
time you logged in for a period of at

1872
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,839
least two weeks

1873
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,200
where they said

1874
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,599
you have unable to find a vacation would

1875
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,680
you like to turn it off

1876
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,359
and i was like

1877
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,359
wait what

1878
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,200
i do know people on facebook sorry i

1879
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,920
asked about this and they said well it's

1880
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,240
pretty simple pair when you have

1881
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,839
1.5 billion users in the

1882
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,520
world there are gonna be some people

1883
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,240
that are clueless absolutely clueless to

1884
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,079
what they just did

1885
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,359
so they they had to do that just to make

1886
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,799
sure that people

1887
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,960
at some level knew what they were doing

1888
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,599
apple have also tried to push the

1889
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,440
adoption of queue authentication for

1890
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,200
your apple account

1891
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,119
google is pushing the advanced

1892
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,359
protection program

1893
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,680
will google

1894
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,400
when will you try to push

1895
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,680
the use of

1896
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,160
fido web authent onto users like to make

1897
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,400
it mandatory for let's say just a couple

1898
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,920
of million users just to see what

1899
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,400
happens that's a great question um i was

1900
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,839
looking for the meme but then i decided

1901
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,039
no i have too many tabs open on my

1902
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,480
browser i don't want to go there i was

1903
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,680
looking for that meme with a guy riding

1904
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,200
the bike and then putting the stick into

1905
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,359
the wheel right i feel like that is what

1906
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,280
facebook was doing when they they tried

1907
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,720
to get like two factor authentication

1908
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,160
adopted and then giving users these

1909
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,160
options to keep turning things off oh

1910
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,440
honestly the question is kind of twofold

1911
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,920
the first is google is on a journey to

1912
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,319
enable two-factor authentication

1913
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,559
managery for a billion users doesn't

1914
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,319
matter if you want it or not you're

1915
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,760
gonna get it and i mean apple is already

1916
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,200
to a certain extent done some of that

1917
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,720
stuff on the icloud side right today

1918
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,000
it's very very hard if you have an

1919
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,079
icloud account it's hard to turn off two

1920
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,440
factors together in that icloud account

1921
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,119
right there was never an explicit moment

1922
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,359
where i turned 2fa on my icloud account

1923
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,799
but it's been there for as long as i can

1924
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,079
remember and that's a conscious choice

1925
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:55,520
in the conscious decision they made

1926
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,119
we're doing the same thing i think we

1927
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,559
just publicized that we've enabled it

1928
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,559
for i think 150 million users if you go

1929
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,160
look at the google blogs uh google

1930
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,240
two-factor like you'll see some uh stuff

1931
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,079
that we've said about like successfully

1932
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,559
testing this out like we we took 150

1933
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,400
million users we've enabled two factors

1934
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,920
indication for them we looked at their

1935
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,680
account health over like a six month

1936
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,039
period and see what happened can they

1937
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,719
still log in can't they log in okay i

1938
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,120
will say i'll cover this with that was

1939
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,880
like a pretty good group of users we

1940
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,640
pick right they have recovery options

1941
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,000
there's other things that's good about

1942
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,759
their accounts that made us want to go

1943
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,439
and pick them but

1944
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,279
it worked out and we're definitely on a

1945
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,359
journey to get two-factor authentication

1946
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,399
in general to more users now let's talk

1947
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,399
about web authent the reason why my

1948
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,839
counterparts in google on the account

1949
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,158
side is so excited about web authentics

1950
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,880
you can sell level 10 as a usability

1951
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
benefit right you can't it's hard to

1952
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,640
sell two-factor as a usability benefit

1953
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,238
right it really is purely a security

1954
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:49,679
benefit and users don't care they're

1955
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,198
like you should keep me safe they're

1956
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,719
really angry at you when you let someone

1957
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,158
else get into their account but for the

1958
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,679
most part they don't want to deal with

1959
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,120
it right they're more angry if you lock

1960
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,319
them out i mean that's obviously the

1961
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,399
worst right so lockout is bad getting

1962
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,158
someone else to their account bad and

1963
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:03,600
then of course for the rest of it they

1964
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,279
don't want to deal with it the way that

1965
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,198
we're thinking about positioning web of

1966
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,960
n is exactly what we've seen in that in

1967
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,040
that banking demo you'll sign into your

1968
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,880
google account one day and you'll just

1969
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,640
get a message that says hey you happen

1970
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,920
to be on a device with a biometric

1971
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,600
sensor like you can have a fingerprint

1972
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,359
or a face or whatever do you want to use

1973
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,198
that to make your signing process easier

1974
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,279
in the future and then the user says yes

1975
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,198
now they have a pass key now that is

1976
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,399
that is the experience that we're

1977
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,000
thinking about for google accounts that

1978
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,439
is the experience that actually um many

1979
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,679
apps have been have been you know

1980
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,319
pushing users towards for the last

1981
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,399
almost decade right if you log into your

1982
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,080
chase or bank of america or whoever like

1983
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,679
into your banking app today that's the

1984
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,679
way that the app up sells you hey do you

1985
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,198
want to use biometrics in the future i

1986
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,520
mean i'm not always a fan of the

1987
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,120
exact user experience and how slick it

1988
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,040
is but what we want to do is make it

1989
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,120
extremely easy for users and have the

1990
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,120
value proposition center around

1991
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,159
usability and ease of use and not around

1992
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,080
security of course it's massive for

1993
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,400
security but that's not what users i

1994
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,800
think in general really care that much

1995
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
about

1996
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,520
sort of tempting to to ask tim the same

1997
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,960
question i

1998
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,520
i can't really remember seeing microsoft

1999
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,400
doing a very significant a very visible

2000
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,199
push for 200 to fight on vacation

2001
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,199
but uh are you planning to sort of push

2002
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,600
to fight away both and on to us and is

2003
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,239
that going to be voluntary or by

2004
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,000
chef horse i'll take one little brag we

2005
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,520
were the first of the three to allow you

2006
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,920
to remove your password completely

2007
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,280
uh that was about a year ago and that's

2008
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,719
been wildly successful yeah we were

2009
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,719
certainly thinking about the day when we

2010
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,520
would mandate to sv um

2011
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,800
and that would be via most likely be a

2012
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,040
pass key or security keys um so it's

2013
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,040
certainly top of mind yeah this is a as

2014
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:47,920
christian mentioned right this is a

2015
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,440
journey this these releases that you're

2016
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,719
going to see very shortly this is not

2017
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:51,920
the end right we're going to constantly

2018
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,760
improve and you know it's it's going to

2019
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,960
be you know it's going to be

2020
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,360
realistically about 12 to 18 months

2021
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,440
before you know we can really start to

2022
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,920
push this on these big accounts yeah

2023
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,600
andrew i mean

2024
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,280
what are you doing from from fighter

2025
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,679
line centrally to sort of like

2026
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,600
i don't know can can you ask all the

2027
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,520
members of fighter lines to push this

2028
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,840
stuff at the same time so we get the

2029
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,000
maximum attention to it all yeah i'm

2030
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,440
gonna do that yeah so a couple points

2031
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,400
here so first of all i think the

2032
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,080
questions are fascinating because to me

2033
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,000
they're all about usability the question

2034
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,080
to tim the question about your mom or

2035
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,920
whoever it might be

2036
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,760
my mom is incredibly difficult on this

2037
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,040
your mom but like it's always your mom

2038
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,120
or whatever it is but you know it's that

2039
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,560
that proverbial person but it's all

2040
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,960
about usability and to that person it's

2041
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,679
like

2042
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,000
you know apple has done a great service

2043
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
of the industry by introducing touch id

2044
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and apple basically consumerized user

2045
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,280
authentication with touch id and people

2046
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,880
are so accustomed now to using

2047
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,280
biometrics that's the expectation of

2048
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,920
user experience uh the facebook

2049
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,080
experiment with trying to mandate uh

2050
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,679
two-factor authentication and sticking

2051
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:54,560
the the

2052
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,400
stick and the smoke that's usability

2053
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,840
challenge and these are not technical

2054
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,000
challenges so again as i said before

2055
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,280
pretty much every conversation i have

2056
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,320
about fido these days begins and ends

2057
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,800
with usability which was not the case 12

2058
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,120
months ago it's about security

2059
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,040
um and all the benefits usability

2060
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,239
actually have obviously security

2061
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,480
implications as well they have

2062
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,239
bottom line benefits and top line

2063
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,159
benefits too

2064
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,239
and so to your question of can we just

2065
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,560
make people do this well no we can't

2066
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,400
but the fact of the matter is you know

2067
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,080
on may 5th of this year

2068
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,719
we had a press announcement with apple

2069
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,120
google microsoft and fido alliance

2070
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,920
where

2071
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,679
all three platforms

2072
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,280
announced their commitment to support

2073
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,840
this vision of passkeys

2074
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
and you know we can't do much better

2075
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,679
than that right and all three platforms

2076
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,440
are going to support this starting with

2077
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,840
ios and mac os this year following with

2078
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
android and

2079
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,600
windows over the next 12 to 18 months so

2080
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,080
i think that as that endpoint support

2081
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,000
becomes more and more prevalent we will

2082
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,760
see the service providers

2083
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,520
you know go towards pass keys and

2084
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,800
there's a lot of discussions right now

2085
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,199
about how and when and why they need to

2086
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,120
do it

2087
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,360
to be clear as tim just pointed out like

2088
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,199
this is a technology

2089
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,360
in development right so the technology's

2090
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,280
mature right it will be it's already out

2091
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,600
in ios and beta form right now but like

2092
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,760
any new technology it does need to

2093
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,920
iterate it will iterate based on market

2094
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,159
feedback based on market forces and

2095
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,280
we're taking you know that feedback's

2096
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,640
happening organically and also through

2097
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,719
the alliance itself so that pass key

2098
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,880
over time will become more and more

2099
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,199
you know better tuned and also fit all

2100
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,640
market demands

2101
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,000
one other point that we're doing inside

2102
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,760
of fido alliance you know we're not just

2103
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,440
hearing about usability

2104
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,719
we're actually embracing it as a

2105
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,239
standards organization to everything we

2106
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,159
do so we have a ux committee we have a

2107
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,400
ux system coming into place looking at

2108
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,480
user experience at every step of the way

2109
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,159
across our specifications and across our

2110
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,480
outputs so pass key will be front and

2111
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,080
center but we're also looking at things

2112
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,480
like ux for security keys and other

2113
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,760
deployments of photo authentication

2114
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,120
how can we

2115
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,760
again the usability is a very good point

2116
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,560
i do have a t-shirt today a

2117
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,560
friend in israel avid

2118
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,040
called a security digger section on

2119
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,760
twitter he has a rule of its rule he

2120
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,400
says security at the expense of

2121
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,640
usability comes at the expense of

2122
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,480
security

2123
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,239
it's a really good one

2124
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,400
um

2125
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,760
is fido you know is it easy for

2126
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,239
normal people just to get started or do

2127
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,960
we actually have to do any kind of

2128
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,360
training to get them stuck with this i

2129
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,080
mean again back to my mom can she figure

2130
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,400
this stuff out without any kind of

2131
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,719
training at all because training is a

2132
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,480
cost so let me talk about the user

2133
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,000
perspective then turn over to tim and

2134
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,199
christian talk about the you know the

2135
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,760
developers perspective so web month in

2136
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,800
again is a remarkable um

2137
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,880
api and it's built in every browser and

2138
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,800
anyone could basically deploy it today

2139
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,920
for you know use of platform

2140
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,800
authenticators that being said um you

2141
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,400
know we heard from service providers

2142
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,840
like hey this is really exciting but

2143
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,800
like

2144
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,320
there's some wonky stuff happening with

2145
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,239
like os prompts and browser prompts and

2146
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,239
like we don't know if this is being how

2147
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,080
do we deploy this as we actually did our

2148
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,640
first ux study last year we hired an

2149
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,480
external ux firm

2150
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,719
we had a ux beta committee

2151
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,960
um led by you know not your typical

2152
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,800
standards wonks but by

2153
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,560
ux and design leads from companies like

2154
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,040
visa and apple and intuit and jpmorgan

2155
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,920
chase who helped scope a study

2156
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,400
the three-part study both um moderated

2157
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,880
unmoderated testing of people actually

2158
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,640
trying to enroll

2159
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,400
and leverage a platform authenticator to

2160
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,199
log in to a site supporting web auth in

2161
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,719
and we learned so much from that and

2162
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,400
it's fascinating watching users do

2163
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,360
things like

2164
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,760
try to use touch id on a macbook to log

2165
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,000
into if it ditches bank site and

2166
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,840
watching like this focus group someone

2167
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,600
being like wait a second like

2168
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,960
why does it want my fingerprint and why

2169
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,880
is this bank with my fingerprint and why

2170
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,320
do they want this and so what we learned

2171
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,600
is that there's a lot of education that

2172
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,520
needs to happen about like hey first of

2173
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,840
all your fingerprints not leaving

2174
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,400
but also all the user flows they're in

2175
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,239
and most of the design stuff that we

2176
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,520
figured out was not about

2177
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,640
iconography and colors and stuff like

2178
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,880
that it's about terminology

2179
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,400
and getting information across

2180
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,080
effectively and letting people know

2181
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,239
what's happening and like selectively

2182
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,400
disclosing information as they go along

2183
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,920
to help walk them through the entire

2184
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,120
user journey from being primed to enroll

2185
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,640
for a web then

2186
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,280
for your account on through to login and

2187
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,000
customer support and stuff like that so

2188
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,600
there's a lot of science behind this and

2189
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,120
we're trying to take that on as a body

2190
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,280
and then making these guidelines freely

2191
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,800
available to anyone to use which they

2192
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,520
are

2193
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,760
today and they are being utilized uh

2194
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,440
usability studies on this before we move

2195
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,199
on to christian just an additional

2196
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:44,960
follow-up on last one

2197
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,120
usability studies in the us

2198
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,600
fine i'm from norway

2199
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,199
and i will make the claim there are

2200
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,440
social and cultural differences between

2201
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,679
well different cultures uh different

2202
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,120
countries across borders across

2203
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
nations everything

2204
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,040
have this been tested out in

2205
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,760
european countries as it passes out in

2206
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,480
germany which are just a tad more

2207
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,719
privacy concern than anyone else in the

2208
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,560
world i think so i just want to act that

2209
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,640
before andrew armstrong we're seeing

2210
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,800
statistically significant

2211
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,400
difference in

2212
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,960
in pass rates users being able to pass

2213
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,239
this and looking at different

2214
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,880
jurisdictions so absolutely there is

2215
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,560
definitely differences that we see in

2216
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,880
ways that we need to approach that

2217
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,719
yeah

2218
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,199
okay uh anything more to add to this you

2219
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,400
know how to do you want to talk about

2220
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,480
the developer side yeah yes well we can

2221
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,320
go to the technical side as well it's a

2222
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,520
good point

2223
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,800
yeah i mean i mean even just high level

2224
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,640
for developers right

2225
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,040
all of everything that you saw um today

2226
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,280
was very minor tweaks to the existing

2227
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,840
502 web then stack right we the the

2228
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,679
autofill is literally adding a new tag

2229
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,679
to a username field the cross device

2230
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,520
thing is not something you as a relying

2231
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,960
party or website have to implement

2232
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,320
that's all handled by the platform all

2233
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,880
that magic is handled at that c-tap

2234
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,960
layer that christian mentioned client to

2235
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,480
authenticator protocol

2236
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,080
and so one thing that we think is

2237
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,920
different here is that we have a very

2238
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,040
very

2239
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,360
clean specific use case now right which

2240
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,280
when all these specifications came out

2241
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,640
right there was you know if you've ever

2242
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,159
read any spec right you know they're

2243
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,600
they're very hard to read right no

2244
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,920
matter how hard we know how hard we try

2245
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,080
to to to make them easier to read and

2246
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,199
i'm one of the people who write some of

2247
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:23,920
them

2248
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,679
they're just they're too big they're

2249
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,679
hard for a developer to pick up and so

2250
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,600
what's unique here is you know the goal

2251
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,520
that we have for some

2252
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,840
new developer resources is that if a

2253
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,880
developer that has a site that the only

2254
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,000
reason they added sms otp or email magic

2255
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,440
link was because they're you know they

2256
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,040
were told you know passwords are

2257
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,800
phishable and we can't have that they

2258
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,800
should be able to go to the site and

2259
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,520
implement pass keys without ever picking

2260
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,040
up the web authent spec right that's the

2261
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,960
goal right like we never we may not even

2262
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,120
link to it that's what we're thinking

2263
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,880
and that that would that didn't that

2264
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,320
really wasn't possible before because

2265
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,600
there's just when you when you start

2266
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,880
looking at a spec like that there's so

2267
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,560
many different use cases it's addressing

2268
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,199
and we really have a very clean very

2269
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,280
boxed in use case here that applies to

2270
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,280
nearly everyone and the other dimension

2271
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,880
to it is we didn't have any good

2272
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,159
libraries at the time right there were

2273
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,159
some like reference implementations but

2274
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,400
again they were served either not enough

2275
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
use cases or too many use cases there's

2276
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,679
a one

2277
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,000
one specific library called simple web

2278
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,840
authent that is already ready for all

2279
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,600
this pesky stuff we found a bug in it

2280
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,440
last week it was fixed in two days right

2281
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
we have amazing libraries that no one

2282
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,719
has to go write the stuff themselves

2283
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,320
anymore and we think that that's a

2284
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,400
that's a big change from the first go

2285
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,440
around with trying to get folks to

2286
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,159
implement this and when why do i then

2287
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,679
have developers telling me that

2288
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,679
implementing this stuff

2289
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:42,960
is difficult

2290
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,199
no i and i think it was and i think what

2291
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,120
we're hoping is because we have kind of

2292
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,080
a big a big package now that can be

2293
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,440
whether it's the sdk whether it's the

2294
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,600
docs everything should be ready to go

2295
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,520
and and much easier to implement and

2296
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,520
dive into initially than it was before

2297
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,600
and that's from microsoft's perspective

2298
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,440
it's easy

2299
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,520
yeah these resources are actually a

2300
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,360
collaboration between the fido and the

2301
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,280
three companies so okay sure that's

2302
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,120
certainly my perspective but i i think i

2303
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,719
think the dots aren't being connected

2304
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,320
quite yet and that is definitely i mean

2305
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,719
i'm i'm talking to internal business

2306
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,880
development relationship folks on google

2307
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,120
this week finally where we're saying all

2308
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,960
right we can now take a breather most of

2309
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,960
the technology pieces are now there and

2310
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,639
we're on our journey and by the way

2311
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,480
apple mentioned that by the end of the

2312
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,679
year they want to have their releases

2313
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,360
out we're on the same time frame right

2314
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,920
so um on the android side by the end of

2315
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,639
this year we're sincerely hoping that we

2316
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,199
have a release out there that is not

2317
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,880
only ready for testing but is actually

2318
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,639
ready for developing and deploying

2319
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:43,280
against so so uh many of the things that

2320
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,639
i've that i've shown i mean all of the

2321
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:45,840
stuff that i showed was a real live

2322
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,280
running code right nothing there was

2323
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,920
mocked up it was real code um it was you

2324
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,600
know behind some flags and experiments

2325
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,840
but but but the pitch is these things

2326
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,520
should be ready by the end of the year

2327
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,440
um there there should not be a reason

2328
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,199
why developers you know can't get access

2329
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,480
to that and then on the other side get

2330
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,840
access to the resources but like i said

2331
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,600
about the dots i don't think developers

2332
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,199
know that you can go and look at this

2333
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,480
great new library over here and you

2334
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,760
should be looking at this docs error

2335
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,760
here people google web of them they get

2336
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,800
to the spec and they're like what the

2337
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,480
hell is this and i think that that

2338
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,840
really is something that we need to

2339
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,600
address so back to my business folks

2340
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,120
it's like we want to try and make it

2341
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,880
easy like if we can get

2342
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,159
relationships started with the

2343
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,080
developers and i mean that includes the

2344
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,840
top 100 apps but it includes also all of

2345
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,520
the long tail like how does someone pick

2346
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,520
this stuff up the last thing i'll add is

2347
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,000
um whereas we need to make sure there's

2348
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,760
messages for developers or messaging for

2349
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,840
developers i think we've already lost if

2350
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,760
we need to pitch this to end users right

2351
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,040
if we need to go pitch the value

2352
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,800
proposition like today with security

2353
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,320
keys you need to take an action you need

2354
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,760
to buy one and then you need to go and

2355
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,199
navigate on a website and look for

2356
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,320
multi-factor options and look for

2357
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,239
security keys if this is the way that

2358
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,520
the webinar is going to be deployed

2359
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,360
it'll be a huge failure in my opinion

2360
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,040
right web of n should be deployed the

2361
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:51,920
way that

2362
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,199
biometric authentication works today

2363
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,360
which is as a matter of course when

2364
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,199
you're just interacting with the product

2365
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,960
there should be an upsell it should be

2366
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,120
easy to understand in plain language one

2367
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,040
to two sentences at most and it should

2368
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,800
start working no one should go digging

2369
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,719
through settings to enable an account

2370
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,480
for web authentic because that already

2371
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,840
means you need this cognitive kind of

2372
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,520
understanding of how things interact

2373
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,280
that is not the way that we're thinking

2374
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,639
right and one example of this there's a

2375
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,639
there's a very large retailer in the us

2376
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,000
which we're super excited they rolled

2377
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,679
out web authentic but guess what their

2378
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,360
login page says signed in with web

2379
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,040
authent like that's what the button says

2380
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,639
yeah like who what who knows what that

2381
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,920
means right like

2382
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,040
as a user

2383
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,320
that's right they were first right no

2384
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,280
and that's what i mean we were super

2385
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,440
happy they implemented it but that that

2386
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,520
highlighted a market problem which we

2387
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,440
was the reason we needed a generic term

2388
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,880
like pascal

2389
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,639
but you said that you know people will

2390
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,400
just google for web authent and then

2391
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,080
they find the standard and they will say

2392
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,840
you know what the hell is this exactly

2393
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,760
hi

2394
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,080
well you're the owners of the search

2395
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,320
engine so i assume something could be

2396
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,679
done we don't have control over the

2397
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,320
search engine results remember but yes

2398
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,159
yeah the search engine is just living

2399
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,320
his own life so yeah but what one side

2400
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,880
effect which i think is good like inside

2401
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,040
phyto alliance like the like within what

2402
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,120
three weeks after we started using the

2403
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,120
term passkey you we didn't hear web off

2404
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,800
then again everyone was saying passkey

2405
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,639
so that's a nice thing is that we get

2406
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,920
hopefully people are actually finding

2407
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,239
the pesky resources not web

2408
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,120
yeah i mean

2409
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,520
we actually invested in uh

2410
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,600
creating kind of a consumer brand option

2411
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,760
for fido so we had sign in with phyto

2412
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,800
buttons

2413
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,080
which is i still think better than

2414
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,520
assignment web authent or whatever so

2415
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,040
the market but the market didn't accept

2416
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,120
it which is fine you know and we have a

2417
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,480
mark with that but we put it out there's

2418
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,080
a straw man the market didn't accept it

2419
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,920
and that's fine you know but we

2420
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,520
understand there needs to be a name for

2421
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,440
something right and so we we do think

2422
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,320
that pasqui as a noun will be that name

2423
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,400
yeah but but that's what i want to i

2424
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,080
want to i mean the reason why we're here

2425
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,440
is like i want to also put it out to the

2426
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,600
room here the folks here are the like

2427
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,360
this is our ambassadors like hopefully

2428
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,199
like help us in getting the word out

2429
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,440
like resources and developer efforts and

2430
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,440
libraries like i mean that is really

2431
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,280
what we need we can put forth like our

2432
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,639
perspective and and you know

2433
01:23:58,639 --> 01:23:59,840
collectively maybe our three

2434
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,400
organizations but um we will really only

2435
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,800
have success if this is like i was like

2436
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,639
a grassroot efforts between everyone

2437
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,880
involved and the the experts in this

2438
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,880
area kind of like using the technology

2439
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,960
making it their own and releasing their

2440
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,880
own artifacts like that is how we get

2441
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,880
success here i think anyone in the

2442
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,280
audience would like to ask questions

2443
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,679
well but that i didn't have to ask that

2444
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:22,880
question

2445
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,520
any developers that are thinking about

2446
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,520
implementing web or then but they would

2447
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,600
like to ask a couple of questions on you

2448
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,679
know how do i do this or if you find it

2449
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,000
difficult raise your hand

2450
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,440
yep okay yeah

2451
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,919
i can't hear you

2452
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:41,360
hi i'm a developer i read a little bit

2453
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,600
about fido and the web as a lot i'm

2454
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,679
gonna go and give it a try on a demo and

2455
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,440
i kind of drowned the commentation it

2456
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,040
was like a month and a half ago i was

2457
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,360
like oh my god i'm not going anywhere

2458
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,679
here so i i think you guys doing a great

2459
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:54,639
job

2460
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:55,920
but

2461
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,880
maybe

2462
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,960
make it easier for the developers

2463
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,920
that that would be great yeah but uh

2464
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,520
and also i'm very happy that you guys

2465
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,520
came here but i'm missing one uh big

2466
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,520
actor it would be nice if apple was here

2467
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,679
too to get some bit though you can check

2468
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,040
twitter and like

2469
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,199
like it's not anything but like we're

2470
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,880
still in a position where it's hard for

2471
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,400
folks to travel and things like that but

2472
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,239
we're still an epidemic

2473
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,239
yeah but uh when you say we want people

2474
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,480
to collaborate maybe we should be giving

2475
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,400
people like the idea of community like

2476
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,199
the final community so people feel like

2477
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:29,600
they can so that's actually so the the

2478
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,520
actually the the the developer resources

2479
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,880
that i'm talking about which will end up

2480
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,880
being passkeys.dev will be the website

2481
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,320
once it's live that's actually being

2482
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,639
driven by a community group in the w3c

2483
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,000
called the authen community doctrine

2484
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,520
group which maybe we'll need to rename

2485
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,120
the pesky adapter

2486
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,719
but that is actually anyone you know

2487
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,440
anyone can join we meet every two weeks

2488
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,679
and actually it's myself and matt miller

2489
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,520
from cisco who is actually we're

2490
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,600
actually taking the output of that group

2491
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,320
feedback resources and building out this

2492
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,159
developer resource center so please i

2493
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,000
can i can uh yeah

2494
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,600
if you google web authentication group

2495
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,880
it'll come right out that's not the

2496
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,040
thing web off n is a bad word yeah no i

2497
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,560
know and that's what i'm saying we

2498
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,920
probably need to rename it yeah yeah

2499
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,159
that's an artifact of the past i guess

2500
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,320
but that is but we are we do have a i

2501
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,440
would say a pretty good sense of

2502
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,040
community in that group there's also

2503
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,199
there's also a uh where's this thing

2504
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,120
it's also a fido dev uh mail list if

2505
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,360
you're if you're on the issues so it

2506
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,239
it's not a

2507
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:24,080
super vibrant group but there is a fido

2508
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,320
dev google group that you can mail to if

2509
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,599
you run the issues as well

2510
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,519
next

2511
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,199
hello

2512
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,960
i just had one question to make sure i'm

2513
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,560
understanding the security model around

2514
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,199
the pass keys right so the web authent

2515
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,600
u2f more specifically i guess is a very

2516
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,600
decentralized security model right the

2517
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,360
private key doesn't leave the security

2518
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,400
token concept right this is now a switch

2519
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,600
over to

2520
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,360
the credentials are essentially being

2521
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,600
managed by the vendor right so there is

2522
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,159
a shift there i think mentally that we

2523
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,840
need to make sure we're okay with or

2524
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,520
we're thinking about the implications of

2525
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,400
that

2526
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,239
is that an accurate way to capture it

2527
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,159
yeah i don't know i mean

2528
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,600
let me give you my my perspective on

2529
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,600
this right so so uh

2530
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,239
yes to a certain extent i think i think

2531
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,400
we were trying to figure out

2532
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,679
in which way

2533
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,040
what are different ways in which we can

2534
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,520
address this right um the the challenge

2535
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,520
around every single time you buy a new

2536
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,960
device we're gonna know you're gonna be

2537
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,320
up quick right and that's

2538
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,360
essentially what happens to the current

2539
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,400
model and that's also what happens to

2540
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,520
the physical authenticator when you lose

2541
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,440
that authenticator you're so dead right

2542
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,600
so now we recommend get you i mean okay

2543
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,360
that's maybe for like for for folks

2544
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,600
who's like well let's go by these i mean

2545
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,199
that's fine but in a general consumer

2546
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,120
adoption thing we looked at what already

2547
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,400
has traction and what attraction is

2548
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,239
password managers right also not the

2549
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,600
level of attraction we really want them

2550
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,679
to have but but they have traction and

2551
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,520
it's because of synchronization we then

2552
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,600
looked at what is the best kind of like

2553
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,960
line that we can weave through here

2554
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,199
which is like don't place this as files

2555
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,040
on disk like have the os like kind of

2556
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,800
mediate the access to them there are

2557
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,480
certain additional security properties

2558
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,560
but you're right it looks if you squint

2559
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,600
at it it looks a little bit more like

2560
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,040
federation than what level and used to

2561
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,639
look it still isn't quite federation

2562
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,320
because it's still a direct two-party

2563
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,000
relationship right it's between the the

2564
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,080
authenticator and the developer yes

2565
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,679
there is another third party like

2566
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:14,880
meddling here in the middle now which is

2567
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,400
doing the synchronization but if you

2568
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,480
think about it google has

2569
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,880
a thousand folks that is purely tasked

2570
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,480
with making sure that bad guys don't get

2571
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,120
into good use google accounts right

2572
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,800
you're now leveraging if you're if

2573
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,960
you're using pass keys in this way

2574
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,480
you're essentially leveraging the fact

2575
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,320
that we're already have all that

2576
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,920
protection and all that investment and

2577
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,360
making sure only the right users get

2578
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,800
access to the right google accounts

2579
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,639
you're leveraging that now it might be

2580
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,320
that you have a particular use case

2581
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,440
where

2582
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,280
excuse me even that level isn't good

2583
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,360
enough you need to take responsibility

2584
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,600
of your own you know

2585
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,239
i i guess like uh direction here and if

2586
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,239
that's what you want to do there are

2587
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,080
certain things in the specification that

2588
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,239
allows you more granularity where you

2589
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,080
don't have to rely on synchronization i

2590
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,480
will say use that with caution because

2591
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,639
that what that will mean is when the

2592
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,400
user changes to a new device they're

2593
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,920
going to have to start over and unless

2594
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,840
you have a good story there and i and i

2595
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,120
think that's another i didn't want to

2596
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,239
get into that because that's kind of

2597
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:11,840
like where some of the viewpoints

2598
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,040
between like what google's doing markets

2599
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,480
are doing and apple doing differs a

2600
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,920
little bit it's like how much of that

2601
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,080
control do we give developers and how

2602
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,760
much of that of control do we give

2603
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,840
developers in the initial release we're

2604
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,639
very worried that this might go away

2605
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,440
where the usability suffers because of a

2606
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,080
perceived security look at per shirt

2607
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,679
right i mean that's exactly that right

2608
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,520
we we shouldn't all be trying to dial

2609
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,280
this up to 11 because of some perceived

2610
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,719
risk and then in the meantime usability

2611
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,159
suffers and no one uses the technology

2612
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,080
so i i'm being a little vague here but i

2613
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,840
just want to mention yes you're taking a

2614
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,159
new like a new uh anyway i'll stop

2615
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,159
talking on this but i'll say you are you

2616
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,199
aren't taking another uh um you know um

2617
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,280
an additional dependency but i think

2618
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,120
it's a net positive and not a net

2619
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,280
negative yeah i'd say the same thing so

2620
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,239
one other point i want to make is so

2621
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,400
it does change fido security posture

2622
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,239
fundamentally but i want to point out

2623
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:03,360
this was not done without a lot of

2624
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,280
deliberation and a lot of conversation

2625
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,040
internally this wasn't done flippantly

2626
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,520
or without a lot of a lot of a lot of

2627
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,760
conversation ultimately as christian

2628
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,360
said it's the greater good

2629
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,280
right so our goal fido's mission since

2630
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,800
day one has been to

2631
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,199
reduce reliance on passwords

2632
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,960
and this stands to do that taking again

2633
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,679
passwords out of play for so many

2634
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,360
consumer use cases

2635
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,639
um that we decided that this change is

2636
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,239
is worth it and that being said also

2637
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,080
there are ways to work on the spec you

2638
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,880
can you can actually still using passkey

2639
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,320
allow for some you know device bound

2640
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,600
characteristics

2641
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,520
additionally you know for specialized

2642
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,920
use cases enterprise i.t

2643
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,080
highly regulated use cases and so on so

2644
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,480
forth phyto security keys will still be

2645
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,719
the default go to approach and that

2646
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:49,920
won't change

2647
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,000
and just um one other important thing

2648
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
right um the pass keys in your account

2649
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,520
will be intended encrypted right so

2650
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,040
that's an encrypted blob to google

2651
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,560
microsoft and apple

2652
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,760
they're entering encrypted like other

2653
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,560
intended encrypted data so yes we manage

2654
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,000
how they get down to the device but you

2655
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,400
have to unlock them right and analyze

2656
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,880
your policies

2657
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,760
um yeah so i was i was wondering what um

2658
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,239
what are the um

2659
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,080
what have you been discussing regarding

2660
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,320
um account recovery

2661
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,880
um when it comes to this and like

2662
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,719
the issues with vendor lock-in that

2663
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,280
arise as a result of um

2664
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,440
putting the authentication in the device

2665
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,679
yeah i i i think that's a great question

2666
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,440
i'll try and briefly just answer this in

2667
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,560
case you know some of my colleagues here

2668
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,800
also want to get in but i i think um

2669
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,120
you're absolutely right this this

2670
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,000
this

2671
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,600
again hinges on the fact that like with

2672
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,600
many other user data like you you have

2673
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,679
data there is data now that's sitting

2674
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,400
somewhere and you need to like with any

2675
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,239
other data it's your data right you need

2676
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,239
to have the ability to get that data out

2677
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,679
of the ecosystem if you ever want to

2678
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,120
move somewhere else we definitely

2679
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,679
recognize that um you know how we do

2680
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,679
that in a secure way with passwords it's

2681
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,120
kind of like a little easier because we

2682
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,520
all know passwords are like effie and

2683
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,040
you know you have other second factors

2684
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,719
but like i said if we want pass keys to

2685
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,159
be something where you don't necessarily

2686
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,080
need a second factor now suddenly that

2687
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,920
bar is high right and what do you do now

2688
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,000
apple and google have both said i mean

2689
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,320
apple has their uh white paper on

2690
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,480
essentially how the pas key mechanism

2691
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,239
works they also have the one i called

2692
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,239
you know keychain encryption google will

2693
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:21,840
do the same thing right so we will also

2694
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,040
like like them said like it's going to

2695
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,360
be end-to-end encrypted um

2696
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,040
really they're very very similar to ike

2697
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,960
like keychain um first you need access

2698
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,199
to the google account now we are driving

2699
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,960
we're trying to drive

2700
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,960
a multi-factor adoption of google

2701
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,880
accounts um

2702
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,400
by default right and that's not an

2703
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,000
accident that is that is part that is

2704
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,440
part of the foundation what you really

2705
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,960
need for this to be successful right it

2706
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,400
doesn't help to say past is good a

2707
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,639
second factor but then the recovery is a

2708
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:47,920
single factor thing that someone can

2709
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,440
just guess right so that needs to be

2710
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,800
solved number one the second thing that

2711
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,159
needs to be solved is or the second

2712
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:53,360
thing that we're doing is similar to

2713
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,040
apple um just having access to the

2714
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,199
account is not enough um you also need

2715
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,639
to have access to some other information

2716
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,080
the information that apple chose the

2717
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,280
information that google is choosing to

2718
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,199
do is you need to know how to unlock one

2719
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,280
of the devices that was previously part

2720
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,120
of your call it sync fabric like

2721
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,800
whatever that local lock screen that's

2722
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,719
actually used as a derived key for as

2723
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,080
part of the end-to-end encryption

2724
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,360
mechanism that we use um so we think

2725
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,440
mandatory like usb which we're trying to

2726
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,560
like drive in plus that factor plus all

2727
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,239
the other additional i mean i had a

2728
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:23,760
slide that i didn't show here but like

2729
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,920
if you think about it over 99.9 percent

2730
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,840
of automated attacks where an attacker

2731
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,600
has your correct google password will

2732
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,199
block we won't allow them in because

2733
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:32,719
there are so many other things that we

2734
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,560
know about attackers and where they come

2735
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,560
from and how they look so all of that

2736
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,480
benefits are there and on top of that we

2737
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,560
then layer the 2sv we layer the the

2738
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,320
additional like screen unlock so we

2739
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,040
think we have a very a pretty strong and

2740
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,280
a pretty robust system if after that you

2741
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,639
say no no i still need additional

2742
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,320
security for my use cases there are

2743
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,080
things in the spec that enable that but

2744
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,239
i think for most relying parties we're

2745
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:57,199
hoping that that where we've set the bar

2746
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,040
is essentially where we'd like to where

2747
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,639
we'd like to keep it i'll get in front

2748
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,239
of one question just briefly by also

2749
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,239
saying we're not saying this has to be

2750
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:06,000
keys always stored in apple or it has to

2751
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,920
be keys always stored in google that is

2752
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,159
our initial implementation but we are

2753
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:11,760
very much of the opinion that we need to

2754
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,719
do what we've done with password

2755
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,880
managers and we need to make an open

2756
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,040
user choice right if you want to use a

2757
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,040
credential called our credential manager

2758
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,360
password manager a third-party one we

2759
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,280
need to allow for good pluggable

2760
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,040
architectures to make that possible but

2761
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,440
you can imagine how much more complex

2762
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,520
that decision tree now is for a relying

2763
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,679
party or a developer because google

2764
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,000
end-to-end encrypts does password

2765
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,920
manager xyz end-to-end interrupt what is

2766
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,280
their security properties when it comes

2767
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,960
to account recovery so all these things

2768
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,119
have to be taken into account um we

2769
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:43,040
think we have solutions but we would

2770
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,480
actually love to have a separate

2771
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,560
conversation about those kind of things

2772
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,719
with folks providing password managers

2773
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,400
and credential managers so that we can

2774
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,239
design the system in a way that makes

2775
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,400
sense for developers and for users and

2776
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,679
even in the short term right if you if

2777
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,119
you look at i would recommend looking at

2778
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:58,800
some of the apple's demos right apple's

2779
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,880
done a fantastic job about merging like

2780
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,239
you can have your pass keys in icloud

2781
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,760
keychain but using lastpass for your

2782
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,119
passwords and they all come up in the

2783
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,560
same ui and you just pick which one you

2784
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,840
want to use right so there's also the

2785
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,920
convergence there in i would say what is

2786
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,520
the short term until we have a fully

2787
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,520
plugable model where you can punch your

2788
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,520
pass keys over to lastpass or whatever

2789
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,679
password you want yeah so uh

2790
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,000
questionnaire from twitter

2791
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,480
what is fido doing to continue to

2792
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,040
provide high security authentication

2793
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,880
with the introduction of pass keys that

2794
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,280
are lower security

2795
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,600
although on security i take offense but

2796
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,000
i will i think i think we kind of hit on

2797
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,880
that right so yeah i also disagree with

2798
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,719
low on security for all the reasons that

2799
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:39,920
we just talked about so there's a

2800
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,760
difference thank you twitter user yes

2801
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,239
but i i think um yeah it's a different

2802
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,920
model and again i think that um

2803
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,440
you know i like to say that fido can

2804
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,960
address address a whole range of use

2805
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,920
cases

2806
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,520
right so again if you know we have a

2807
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,679
very robust certification program we

2808
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:56,960
actually certify authenticators at

2809
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,880
different levels uh to protect you know

2810
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,639
to verify that a

2811
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,560
physical authenticator protects against

2812
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,000
malware attacks or brute force attacks

2813
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,520
or hardware attacks you know so if

2814
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,960
that's your use case you can use one of

2815
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,600
these certified authenticators for that

2816
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,520
i think again the base level fido

2817
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,960
security key

2818
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,600
will remain you know the default go-to

2819
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,320
for you know high security profile use

2820
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,040
cases now beyond that again i think the

2821
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,800
the security properties of passkey are

2822
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,119
not weak they're not weak at all

2823
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,119
and there's in fact i was talking this

2824
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,159
morning

2825
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,840
with the head of authentication at a

2826
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,480
major uh bank in the us i was like hey

2827
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,239
how are you guys looking to pass key

2828
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,360
what do you think about this how do you

2829
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,119
feel about the security posture

2830
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,719
his point is like andrew that's a bunch

2831
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,639
of he's like the gap between

2832
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,960
what i'm doing now which is sms otp and

2833
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,960
what i get with passkey

2834
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,280
the the bar has risen so much from that

2835
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,639
right so maybe there's some use cases

2836
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,800
where like a high transaction or certain

2837
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,040
scenarios where i want to get added data

2838
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,880
or added bullet points in that case you

2839
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,159
know i can take capacity as just a

2840
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,920
single signal feed it into my risk

2841
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,360
engine and do other sorts of step up or

2842
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,600
other sorts of data to make sure that's

2843
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,920
a secure authentication but ultimately

2844
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,000
pasca raises a bar so high from the

2845
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,600
default means of authentication today

2846
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,119
that i don't think it's fair to say it's

2847
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,280
a weak security approach

2848
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,440
so i i have two

2849
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,800
i have two quick questions um i think a

2850
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,000
lot of people's concern when they're

2851
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,920
talking lower security is in comparison

2852
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,719
to what the 502 does right now which i i

2853
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,600
do prefer the 502 model i recognize the

2854
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,600
failings and like well now you've got to

2855
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,000
register on every site

2856
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,960
but

2857
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,639
the quick question is

2858
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,320
one of the fundamentals of 502

2859
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,000
originally was the key existed on the

2860
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,760
device and it would never surrender it

2861
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,960
for any reason how do you know a key

2862
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,880
hasn't been cloned off like is it

2863
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,639
possible for a key to get cloned off

2864
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:46,960
maybe you authenticated it through some

2865
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,040
um you know you didn't realize what the

2866
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,960
page is showing you click something and

2867
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,400
then there's a clone out there that

2868
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,239
you're not aware of and that key is

2869
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:55,520
there is there any way to revoke

2870
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,920
credentials um

2871
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,000
so that's the first question i i mean i

2872
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,679
i'll let other folks also answer this i

2873
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,040
think that michael said that further but

2874
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,560
i'll just quickly mention that i mean

2875
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,880
remember um the qr code flow and all

2876
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,560
these things it's not actually your

2877
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,639
private key ever that goes over the only

2878
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,400
time that that will happen is when the

2879
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,199
user decides to sign in to a like to a

2880
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,119
new ios device to a new mac os device

2881
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:18,960
like in the apple ecosystem or to a new

2882
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,040
android device where where there is like

2883
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,560
okay maybe you want you can kind of

2884
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,320
contrive this like this contrast back

2885
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,840
where like you know the user things

2886
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,280
they're giving a google credential

2887
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,719
credentials to like a phishing site and

2888
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,480
then the bad guy runs an emulator at the

2889
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,679
back that looks like a real android

2890
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:32,719
device and they use that to pull the

2891
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:35,920
credentials down i mean we have a lot of

2892
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,800
um technology and signals around are we

2893
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,960
dealing with real legitimate devices or

2894
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,960
not so i think everything there feeds

2895
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,520
into our decision on whether or not we

2896
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,600
want to allow the credential syncing to

2897
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,920
come down to the device um if a user

2898
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,400
does let's say let's say i mean you

2899
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,480
convinced me on your android phone to

2900
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,400
type my credentials in there type my

2901
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,400
previous screen unlock in everything and

2902
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,920
now all my credentials are on that

2903
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,280
particular device let's say that's the

2904
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,480
attack that we're talking about right

2905
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,840
okay now my credentials are there i've

2906
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,159
got new options when i if i realize it i

2907
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:08,639
hope i do at some point um i can either

2908
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,960
go and i can go to you know settings and

2909
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,719
i can go and sign out that device which

2910
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,080
essentially then invalidates the pass

2911
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,440
keys like almost like a remote wipe

2912
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,560
right i can go do that or i can go to

2913
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,159
the various

2914
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,800
accounts for which i hold pass keys but

2915
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,480
but this is the difference in let me

2916
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,159
kind of take an analogy right i lose my

2917
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,320
wallet can i call one number to just

2918
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,280
block

2919
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,280
you sure can i can i can i block my

2920
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,719
entire wallet or do i have to call all

2921
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,159
five credit card companies do i have to

2922
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,600
call up all five credit card companies

2923
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,280
that's not great you have that option

2924
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,960
with baskets you can go to the site and

2925
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,639
individually revoke the past key on that

2926
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,960
device but i would say mostly you would

2927
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,199
just go and like remove the account of

2928
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,239
the device which immediately will

2929
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,920
invalid all the passwords so just to

2930
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,400
clarify on that um each

2931
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,400
each device has a unique credential that

2932
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,920
there's some mechanism that it

2933
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,920
authenticates with like it it's either a

2934
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,400
signing chain or are they all sharing it

2935
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,960
in the android world there is some

2936
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,239
uniqueness that can be used as part of

2937
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:05,280
the

2938
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,400
risk detection um not all platforms

2939
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,800
support that mechanism but there is

2940
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,960
something to die back onto there is

2941
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,639
caveats there but but there is a

2942
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,960
capability right but just just to answer

2943
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,320
more specifically if i have an android

2944
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,000
phone and an android tablet signed in

2945
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,520
the same google account it is the same

2946
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,360
credential on both devices okay so if i

2947
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,760
revoke it from tribank both of those

2948
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,679
devices lose access right okay just like

2949
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,679
a security key today and then the other

2950
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,760
question was because everything on like

2951
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,080
say a yubikey now is done

2952
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,080
locally and the way the mechanism works

2953
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,400
the low-level mechanism you can do

2954
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,920
two-factor authentication or even

2955
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,239
passwordless with um out leaking a lot

2956
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:43,520
of information on what sites you're

2957
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,520
doing stuff like that what type of like

2958
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,920
metadata analysis could google facebook

2959
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,239
or anyone in the phyto alliance be now

2960
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,600
um open to

2961
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,520
um because they're involved in the

2962
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,639
syncing process is it as limited as like

2963
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,159
apps there's no change right because the

2964
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,840
pass keys tied your account are intended

2965
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,440
encrypted right so there's no change in

2966
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,599
that model

2967
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,600
so right now we're definitely encrypting

2968
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,920
all the private keys um to encrypt the

2969
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,880
metadata has issues regarding the way

2970
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,560
that we rendered it on the usability

2971
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,639
side so the mechanism that will work

2972
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:23,199
today metadata won't be encrypted but

2973
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,199
there is also no mining or anything of

2974
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:27,040
that but but technically that's

2975
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,560
something that we could add or that's

2976
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,760
something that if you choose to use a

2977
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,880
different provider in the future that

2978
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,040
they might provide for usability reasons

2979
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,239
we encrypt the private crease and not

2980
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:36,000
the metadata today but that's something

2981
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,840
that is for no reason other than just

2982
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,600
there's a usability constraint on that

2983
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,440
for us

2984
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,239
yeah

2985
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,639
i have a question regarding dual

2986
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:47,600
security keys uh i've implemented a

2987
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,840
couple of these about 10 sites and tried

2988
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,080
to do the password right sorry

2989
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,679
yeah okay

2990
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,159
hello okay

2991
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:59,360
much louder or put it in my mode

2992
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,639
yeah i

2993
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:03,119
developed a lot of this uh uh

2994
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,800
i'm an early adopter and i tried to

2995
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,880
implement a lot of this

2996
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,840
what i felt lacking in the documentation

2997
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,360
or the implementation from before is

2998
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,480
like the um support but dual security

2999
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,600
keys so i want to have my computer that

3000
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,840
has a dpm and such

3001
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,600
and also my security key that is

3002
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,960
attached to my

3003
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,480
yeah keychain

3004
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,320
to be able to do this

3005
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,040
yeah co-op the login how are your

3006
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,679
thoughts about that

3007
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:32,800
so

3008
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,080
just to make sure i understand the

3009
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,320
question like like dual security keys

3010
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,679
[Music]

3011
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,920
so being able to use or need to use both

3012
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,840
at the same time for an authentication i

3013
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,920
mean that's technically already possible

3014
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,280
it's like a relying party choice it's

3015
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,719
kind of like almost like a workflow

3016
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:48,719
where the relying party today can make

3017
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,040
the decision and saying hey i need my

3018
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,119
criteria as a password plus a security

3019
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,199
key or my criteria is a security key

3020
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,199
plus sms otp or my criteria is two

3021
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:58,960
security keys and that's something that

3022
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,040
is totally implementable uh from a

3023
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,639
workflow perspective on the relying

3024
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:04,159
party not something that the spec needs

3025
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,960
an easy change to teach you support

3026
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,040
uh yeah so my question kind of goes

3027
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,480
along with some of the questions that

3028
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,800
you had earlier and uh

3029
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,040
but my scenario is more of the sense of

3030
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,040
the user trying to recover

3031
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,520
their account when their devices lost

3032
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,080
stolen or no longer accessible

3033
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,159
they're traveling for business vacation

3034
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,520
whatever else

3035
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,800
they they have to resort to a machine at

3036
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,280
the hotel whatever to log in to

3037
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,880
access their information whether it's

3038
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,280
bank whatever else what is the user's

3039
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,119
option to be able to access our account

3040
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:39,280
when they don't have access to their

3041
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,119
uh devices that's already been in the

3042
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,199
ecosystem super tough question probably

3043
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:44,719
the toughest one that anyone is asked

3044
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,159
today right and that is that is

3045
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,520
ultimately like how do i know it's the

3046
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,280
right user and it's not someone

3047
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,280
pretending to be the user in this exact

3048
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,199
scenario right um

3049
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:58,080
the the easy answer today is going to be

3050
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,560
you're gonna need to prove to us that

3051
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,920
like it's you through something um you

3052
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,119
will you know if if there is no signal

3053
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:09,280
if it's not coming from a known ip

3054
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,440
address or like a location or something

3055
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,280
that we know about you which is you know

3056
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,320
we've got many different types of

3057
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,199
signals um you know if in the future the

3058
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:18,719
idea is that we remove passwords of

3059
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:19,920
google accounts so there will not be a

3060
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,360
password that will not be a signal that

3061
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,800
you can provide us anymore right because

3062
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,400
it's such a weak signal but then the

3063
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,159
question is what can you provide us well

3064
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,679
maybe you can tell us about how you

3065
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,600
unlocked your previous phone but then

3066
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,880
where are you going to tell that to us

3067
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,119
to the kiosk machine you know

3068
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,639
maybe that's okay but the question is

3069
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,480
also even if you can get into that kiosk

3070
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,000
machine we can't really make your pass

3071
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,920
keys usable from there because then that

3072
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,119
means they will be leaking onto the

3073
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:43,600
kiosk machine so it is a very this is a

3074
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,560
very tough problem um we're kicking the

3075
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,760
count down the road a little bit where

3076
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,199
we say well if you can at least get

3077
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,520
access to like another phone like a new

3078
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,600
one or someone else's you can sign in

3079
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,600
there like then then maybe you can sing

3080
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,440
things down but it's it's very hard

3081
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,440
because it's it's clearly a usability

3082
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:03,360
issue but it is also such a big security

3083
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,280
issue if we let the wrong user in or

3084
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,400
sync the credentials to a shared

3085
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,960
terminal then we don't have a perfect

3086
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,119
answer for that today but that is a

3087
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:12,080
problem that users are already

3088
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,239
experiencing right now but i think one

3089
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:15,760
potential thing right so let's assume

3090
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,280
that their phone got stolen but their

3091
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,119
laptop didn't we do have the ability to

3092
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,960
reverse that cross-device flow yeah it's

3093
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,239
just a little awkward right now turning

3094
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:24,480
your laptop to scan a qr code um that

3095
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,000
the protocol allows that right we just

3096
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,280
haven't enabled that experience so you

3097
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,960
could in theory use your laptop that

3098
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,159
didn't get stolen because in your hotel

3099
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:31,440
room to get back into your google

3100
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,880
account by reversing the flow it's

3101
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,080
totally possible and apple's actually

3102
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,480
already supporting it for ipad and mac

3103
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,840
if you have nothing that we're stuck

3104
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,119
right

3105
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:42,320
they don't have access absolutely

3106
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,800
yeah hey uh yes uh

3107
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,719
thank you for your time by the way um

3108
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,719
how do you see uh

3109
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:50,960
onboarding working for first time log in

3110
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,639
like say you had no relationship to that

3111
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,800
tri bank no account no nothing no

3112
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,920
existing account how do you see that

3113
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,480
working and can you complete that

3114
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,400
workflow without ever ever making a

3115
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,760
password

3116
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,520
that that's the goal right i would say i

3117
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,280
i hope in the next 12 to 18 months we'll

3118
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,800
start to see the first truly

3119
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,320
passwordless accounts with passkeys

3120
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,159
right the way we see this right you you

3121
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,360
still probably have to capture name and

3122
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,960
email address and phone number and then

3123
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,119
maybe when you hit submit it invokes web

3124
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,199
invokes the api creates a pass key and

3125
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,800
away you go you're on your way so the

3126
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,560
password field is gone you never capture

3127
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,320
it password and there are there are

3128
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,800
sites that already very small number but

3129
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,080
there are already sites that are doing

3130
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,360
that today but we hope the user

3131
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,199
experience will be much cleaner with us

3132
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,800
yeah and certain service providers are

3133
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,159
onboarding people without passwords

3134
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,679
today based on other

3135
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,679
proprietary data they might have like a

3136
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,679
telco for example has account

3137
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,199
information about them or other network

3138
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:40,880
api data they can use

3139
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,480
um we're also inside of fido alliance we

3140
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,719
have we're doing some standardization

3141
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,480
work around identity proofing and

3142
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,920
verification

3143
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,440
which if we pull off which is you know

3144
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,520
very complex i think actually stands to

3145
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,520
have as much impact on the market and

3146
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,040
this whole problem as the authentication

3147
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,360
piece does that's still pretty nascent

3148
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
um although we do have we'll have our

3149
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,920
first uh doc-off requirements document

3150
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,119
out in the next

3151
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:06,599
next couple months

3152
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,119
um

3153
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,639
it's it's really good to hear that

3154
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:15,440
you're taking on such a skilled uh

3155
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,639
usability uh team uh to uh work on your

3156
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:22,480
usability because my primary worry is

3157
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,119
and then i get divorced what happened i

3158
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,520
i managed to set up all my devices but

3159
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,000
all of a sudden i am now

3160
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,400
going to untangle myself from the

3161
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,560
complexity that i've just made

3162
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,440
am i able to do i understand this

3163
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:41,678
or what if i die what happens

3164
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,800
that's a good one for you yeah christian

3165
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,480
well no tim

3166
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,840
well just like fashion magic right i

3167
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,639
mean

3168
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,800
yeah i mean there's well

3169
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,080
no no

3170
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,280
it's like it's like the bathroom manager

3171
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,480
today

3172
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,760
it's i'm not saying the problem is

3173
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,600
solved but it's very similar to what you

3174
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,920
already have with basketball

3175
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,679
right yeah yeah i would agree with that

3176
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:03,679
we're not we're not necessarily solving

3177
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,360
everything right these are not

3178
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,960
necessarily net new but that's part of

3179
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,800
iterating over time too right like we've

3180
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,199
already seen apple iterate on some of

3181
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:12,719
the digital legacy stuff that a lot that

3182
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:13,840
is thinking about that right so that's

3183
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,520
something we can enable over time as we

3184
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:16,400
start to think about what are the

3185
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,760
security implications of sharing a

3186
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,360
passkey right like all these different

3187
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,199
how do you pull that passkey back is it

3188
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,639
better you know one question we keep

3189
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,960
asking is it better for me to send you

3190
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,800
my pass key for my netflix account or

3191
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,400
just have you add a passkey to my

3192
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,840
netflix account right these are the

3193
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:30,800
these are the things we're starting

3194
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,880
about all around revocability and all

3195
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,880
these models netflix things neither yeah

3196
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,960
well yeah terms of service official yeah

3197
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,119
yeah yeah yeah netflix i would think is

3198
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,760
very happy about pesky

3199
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,280
now they are yeah

3200
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,119
yeah i just i have basically the same

3201
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,800
question about shared devices it's a

3202
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,560
really common use case our customers are

3203
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,119
commonly coming to i work at slack and

3204
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,119
they they want the ability to have check

3205
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:57,040
out personnel use the same ipad and have

3206
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,880
a secure experience

3207
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,239
logging and logging out yeah so that

3208
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:02,080
that's actually so the one thing um you

3209
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,840
know christian's demo is really great

3210
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,840
showing the cross device flow where we

3211
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,520
step up and create you aposky on the

3212
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,360
local device the other flip side of that

3213
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,719
use case which we will heavily use in

3214
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:12,719
windows right the example i always use

3215
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:14,560
as a gate agent at the airport right you

3216
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,080
never want to create local pass keys on

3217
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,599
that terminal you always want to use the

3218
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,199
cross device flow so the shared device

3219
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,360
flow the shared device scenario is one

3220
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,880
where you will always want to use that

3221
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,119
cross device and never never even you

3222
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:26,159
may not even want to keep the

3223
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,520
relationship between that phone and that

3224
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,040
device it's completely ephemeral and in

3225
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,719
some cases maybe even a security key

3226
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:32,159
it's better than a phone there like tap

3227
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,520
the security key it personalized and

3228
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,199
then when you remove it

3229
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:37,679
and those are great examples of you know

3230
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,520
you know the question we got i think

3231
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,719
last night at dinner was like well this

3232
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,400
is this is a consumer feature right and

3233
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,800
the answer is it's targeted at very

3234
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,880
consumer-centric use cases but if you

3235
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,960
look at a frontline worker in a retail

3236
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,960
environment uh you know i can tell you

3237
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,800
as azure ad identity provider they're

3238
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,719
using sms sign-in this is instantly

3239
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,000
better and those are quote-unquote

3240
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,760
enterprise scenarios right so the gate

3241
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,360
agent use case same thing like what is

3242
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,440
what is better than using a fishable

3243
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,800
mechanism or this fishing resistant

3244
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,560
thing that may or may not be on their

3245
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,000
personal phone or a managed device it's

3246
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,760
still better and in a better user

3247
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,960
experience less efficient yeah we

3248
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,080
shouldn't rule out pesky for the

3249
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,280
enterprise

3250
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,760
what's the azure date like 28 of azure

3251
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,679
clients are using mfa yeah so we can

3252
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,280
move that up you know 10 20 percent by

3253
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,119
using pass keys that's that's a great

3254
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,880
thing and christian alluded to right

3255
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,880
where we are we have added to the to the

3256
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,880
specifications options for enterprises

3257
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,320
or i hate the term enterprise work

3258
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,239
school higher security you could argue

3259
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,920
that like a twitter verified user is

3260
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,280
closer to an enterprise user than a

3261
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,520
consumer as one example so where uh you

3262
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,199
know there are there are mechanisms in

3263
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:36,880
the spec to to accommodate those that

3264
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,119
you'll start to see uh implementing

3265
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:40,719
so we are we're getting close to the

3266
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:42,800
time where i have to uh end this and

3267
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,159
there will also be a one hour break

3268
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:47,040
before we continue but again uh this

3269
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:51,800
one's for you first andrew um

3270
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,880
privacy in this i mean security is one

3271
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,400
thing privacy is

3272
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,639
part of security it is also something

3273
01:50:58,639 --> 01:50:59,679
different

3274
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:00,560
so

3275
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,960
have you looked into if this

3276
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,239
pass keys

3277
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,320
fido web authentic youtube whatever you

3278
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,000
want to call it

3279
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,360
you should really look into

3280
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,400
standardizing stuff yeah yeah

3281
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,880
on the privacy part of things have you

3282
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,920
looked into whether this technology will

3283
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,560
improve privacy or if it also introduces

3284
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,599
new

3285
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,119
privacy

3286
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:25,280
difficulties for people in any way

3287
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,840
whatsoever like my friend cecilia asking

3288
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,960
well what about when i got get divorced

3289
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,760
is it suddenly harder to maintain good

3290
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,840
privacy as an example yeah but that's a

3291
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,360
great question and this is the type of

3292
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,639
discussion we're having inside of fido

3293
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:39,920
alliance today so i'm not going to give

3294
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,760
you a really square answer on that we

3295
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,040
have a security and privacy working

3296
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,800
group that's looking at these issues

3297
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,760
coming up with the best kind of a

3298
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,840
canonical approach if you will for how

3299
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,920
one should implement passkey to

3300
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,920
um to adhere to fido's privacy

3301
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,920
principles that we've had since day one

3302
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,199
yep and so i think there's certainly

3303
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:56,480
already implications there's there's so

3304
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,480
there's that conversation happening the

3305
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,239
other thing we do as a body actively is

3306
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:03,040
we engage with regulators um

3307
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,040
across the world to understand how you

3308
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,440
know fido authentication in our various

3309
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,560
forms

3310
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,639
fits in with current and emerging

3311
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,679
privacy and regulatory policies so i

3312
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:15,520
mean like any new technology that we

3313
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,960
introduce in phytoalliance or elsewhere

3314
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,520
that impact user authentication

3315
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,800
we look at it closely inside the

3316
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,480
alliance and figure out you know how

3317
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,599
fido's

3318
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,840
best practices and specifications can

3319
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,560
meet you know the privacy needs so yeah

3320
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,480
one one thing that i'll and i'll speak

3321
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,239
specifically for microsoft on this um

3322
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,760
one thing that has come up uh in the

3323
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,760
past few months for us is thinking about

3324
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:38,080
how easy it is for users to use consumer

3325
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,960
federated sign-in right passkey has the

3326
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,040
opportunity to remove

3327
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,800
the need to do consumer federated

3328
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,239
signing which has serious privacy

3329
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:48,000
implications right you're telling that

3330
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,280
identity provider everywhere you're

3331
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,119
signing in now on the enterprise side

3332
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:52,400
that's what people pay for right you're

3333
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,760
paying for federation you're paying to

3334
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,119
track employees because you need to

3335
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,960
enforce policy the consumer side they're

3336
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,639
doing it because it's easy so it's back

3337
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,400
to whoever asked the sign up flow if

3338
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,639
that sign up flow is as frictionless as

3339
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:05,280
as clicking sign in with x that i won't

3340
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,040
name

3341
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,639
i'm just kidding yeah i know just

3342
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,000
kidding we have it too technically no

3343
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,719
one uses it but um no

3344
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:14,000
no so if we can make that as

3345
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,560
frictionless as possible um then you

3346
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,800
could make the argument that consumer

3347
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,960
federation with these big big identity

3348
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,599
providers could and maybe should go down

3349
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,280
significantly over time i'll say one

3350
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,560
thing for 30 seconds this is the other

3351
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,719
point right i think a lot of the a lot

3352
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,960
of the questions around like i mean

3353
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,520
there there's a whole

3354
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,679
you know slew of use cases which i won't

3355
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:37,119
even go into because they're all super

3356
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:40,000
depressing but around you know whether

3357
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,239
or not users should get access and what

3358
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,000
happens when folks break up and like

3359
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,520
there's there's this whole and i think a

3360
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,280
lot of that isn't so much the protocol

3361
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,560
it's around the implementation of the

3362
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,080
protocol and that's good and bad because

3363
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,440
that means hey the protocol is done but

3364
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,040
that also means the relying parties need

3365
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,560
to take ownership of those experiences

3366
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,080
themselves i know we're having

3367
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,760
discussions at google around like what

3368
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,920
does it mean to give someone access to

3369
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,840
you know and rather than typing a google

3370
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,520
account password now you can just use

3371
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,800
the screen lock on the device what if

3372
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,440
that's a you know a spouse's device what

3373
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,119
if that's the shared kids tablet like

3374
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:10,719
how do i revoke that and i think we're

3375
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:11,840
trying to think through those and

3376
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,080
implement uh you know particular

3377
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,880
workflows but the the downside is that

3378
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,480
means every single relying party need to

3379
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,719
do the same thing and and i think that

3380
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:22,880
can be tricky and i think we're gonna

3381
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,480
you know folks will get it wrong like i

3382
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,000
think you know we're not better like

3383
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,239
it'll but but i think we are absolutely

3384
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:29,840
trying to think through those use cases

3385
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,280
because we do realize that they are

3386
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,719
important

3387
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:35,599
and and use cases on this i i think that

3388
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,239
well i i know that

3389
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,639
cecilia myself we will most definitely

3390
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:43,679
be looking into the abusability aspects

3391
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:46,320
of this absolutely for the for the next

3392
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,000
weeks and months and years as well we

3393
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,760
are really interested in this stuff so

3394
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,599
it's interesting um we're getting very

3395
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,440
very close um

3396
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,760
i want the sales pitch

3397
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,880
for this

3398
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,360
because i'm based on me saying

3399
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,599
there is no risk analysis and there is

3400
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:03,360
no business case

3401
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:07,040
just defined removal of passwords so try

3402
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,960
me yeah give me the sense i'm going to

3403
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,159
give you a hot tape

3404
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,679
tell me i'm wrong i'm going to give you

3405
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:13,599
a hot take one

3406
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:15,920
how much is your sms cost your sms

3407
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,760
service how much did you pay per year i

3408
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,119
could tell you

3409
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,560
i'm not going to tell you what microsoft

3410
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,840
is

3411
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,599
we're talking millions of dollars across

3412
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,440
these companies for even just an sms

3413
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,679
based sign-in right that's

3414
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,119
not the primary reason but that's a hot

3415
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:30,880
take that often has come up in

3416
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,560
discussions is what do these other

3417
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,000
methods actually cost that are

3418
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,760
completely unnecessary if the primary

3419
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,639
factor is phishing resistant

3420
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,119
christian sales pitch i mean

3421
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:42,960
i i haven't prepared this one but i

3422
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,280
guess my talking points here would be

3423
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,440
something along the lines of if you're

3424
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,280
not removing the password

3425
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,719
and you're making the password safer

3426
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:52,639
you're adding something adding something

3427
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:54,239
comes at the

3428
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,080
like you're immediately the moment

3429
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,679
you're adding you're you're you're

3430
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:59,520
taking you know you're making usability

3431
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,199
worse like that is just the insecurity

3432
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:02,400
like the the when there's something

3433
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,639
additive security is being made worse

3434
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:06,719
the only way where we can make usability

3435
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:08,639
better or keep it on par

3436
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:11,679
while adding the security protection is

3437
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,360
taking something away and what is the

3438
