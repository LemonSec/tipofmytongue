1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:24,600
losing sight of the fact we heard it
closer look impossible huh

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,980
ok

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,670
so we have been asked Mike Sullivan

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:50,219
much of what these results showed up
well I mean I do some ok that's all

5
00:00:50,219 --> 00:01:05,630
folks you know somebody says something
about him thanks I'll be talking about

6
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:13,770
pastor basic kitchen today I'll be loose
term could mean you know memory hardness

7
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,590
but we will see what I mean by that is I
got so why would you do this why why

8
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:27,299
would you incomplete pass very
encouraging people to do this already

9
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:37,490
are a good team and it is expensive it's
hard to do well you need a place to

10
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:45,929
store your key and typically you'll want
to back it up and hotel prices justified

11
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,250
usually when you think the password you
trippin gave that to yourself so you're

12
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,560
the sort of the sender and the recipient

13
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,960
and its its overall it's pretty right
most people can password protect a Word

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,340
file but if you listen to encrypt
something with PDP days they might not

15
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,620
have such an easy time so you're not
arguing we need to do this tomorrow but

16
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,709
he's gonna do it are presented idea that
might make it more secure

17
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:29,630
use cases so I mentioned Office
documents to Word documents zip file

18
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,489
kept X files can also be
password-protected password managers you

19
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,130
know that's not a password

20
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:50,390
another passport applications secure
data with DAPI or sequel site are using

21
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:58,140
maybe indirectly has been based
encryption the Tar snap backup software

22
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,160
has a utility to encrypt files but the
password using a script and the

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,519
TrueCrypt

24
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:16,850
Christian system uses facing corruption
as well as ok I swear I'll start with

25
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,319
just a picture of you know normal
encryption where there's a plain text

26
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,850
that top we have an idea that the random
value which changes for each encryption

27
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,049
operation

28
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,140
those two together with ease our imports
to encrypt function which outputs the

29
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:41,459
ciphertext and and the IB so that's
without a password the password so

30
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,480
typically go through function key
derivation and that's where you get your

31
00:03:48,480 --> 00:04:00,060
and then everything else is is the same
so you know usually we also want to

32
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,400
dedicate our ciphertext using a Mac so
there's actually two keys that are

33
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,770
derived and we don't just in crypt where
we are as well and there's a tag but he

34
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:21,400
and and so some concrete examples here
you might use to create a derivation

35
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,690
this is an iterated

36
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:35,430
and CBC and HMAC are certain examples of
encryption and authentication programs

37
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,940
so the threat facing corruption is
different from having password hashes in

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:51,860
a password file so it should be rare
let's hope and it's it's a certain

39
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,300
security event where Christian the
sacred texts like sent over email or put

40
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:08,450
on a share somewhere so that hash but
the opportunity is there right away by

41
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:18,530
default under attack and changing the
password is back it once i text it is

42
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:30,419
out there and you can change your
password in order to protect so jet

43
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:40,900
model remains encryption last year hurts
so we will assume that the attacker gets

44
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,010
to see the entire out the salty I D in a
separate accident the tag everything

45
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,050
that you would need for decryption the
attacker gets to see this attack so it's

46
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,150
only happened once I protects under
attack

47
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,679
and also assume that the attacker knows
some of the plane so typically you know

48
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,080
these files with standard head hurts so
we'll just assume that the attacker

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,530
either knows the editor or check that
when he doesn't you christiane that the

50
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:25,130
decrypted value matches the format has a
cracked part so I guess he drives the

51
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,830
candidate keys does option of the first
part say the first brought the sacred

52
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:37,700
texts and compare that to the known
plaintext block and if they match then

53
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,789
he'll continue to corruption he quit the
whole file and maybe some other

54
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,870
integrity checks so the cost for each
gases the work to drive east and

55
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:56,400
decrypting one block

56
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,409
the attacker didn't happen short we're
equipped one block and compare it to

57
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,610
something you know so we were more if we
remark that would you can think of

58
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,600
encrypted ran and data

59
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,690
you know the attack would happen it
process all of that and then some

60
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,070
checking another way whether this made
sense this description made sense so

61
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:32,460
that would increase by using S four the
number of blocks but it increased by a

62
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:40,940
factor and if you know it's a large file
this this could be seen it so as I said

63
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,210
I call this i/o cost maybe it's on it
maybe the files on the disk it's really

64
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,770
large or medium fits into memory and
then it's like a memory cost but the

65
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,070
important thing is that the defender is
already doing this work right when you

66
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:06,030
have a memory heart this is purely over
at its something that the attacker

67
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:27,409
something he wouldn't normally do I
protect the children are not being so

68
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:37,479
basically we're gonna include are so the
encoding is randomized and encode and

69
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,380
decode punch and there's no secrets here
there's no secret key but the security

70
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,970
properties get is that if you're given
part of an encoded plain text you can't

71
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,370
decode it and tell you have all of it so

72
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,050
if you only have first block that
doesn't know if you're only missing a

73
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,770
few bits you might be able to boot for
us

74
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:08,040
them but you know if you're missing more
than a hundred and twenty eight bits you

75
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,779
won't be able to did you do the decode
operation so why would somebody that

76
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:24,220
such a thing as a good crypto paper from
1997 by Rivest and his goal was to

77
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,110
improve the strength of encryption using
expertise which is sort of similar to

78
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,600
past third base encryption you know it's
something that you don't want to do but

79
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,120
maybe you you know it's it's your best
option or option and expertise and

80
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:49,150
password or so later it was shown that
which is a padding motor RSA encryption

81
00:09:49,150 --> 00:10:00,089
is an all or nothing and we best chance
is a special case so hopefully he so I

82
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:16,140
guess just to look at in this work just
to review our plain text input we need

83
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,649
to function Steen H

84
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:25,420
she takes a random seed it's you know
shorts and expanded into something like

85
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,069
a key stream he could think of G being
being a counter mode and then you

86
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:43,819
explored this text is why and then you
need to somehow hi our site so that y

87
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:50,529
Cantina coded without it so you have why
an expert with our and then append not

88
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:59,470
the end and then so you can convince
yourself that that this works so to

89
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:09,639
decode that why X-ers it with yr to
recover are and then we compute cheat

90
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:16,300
and text

91
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:27,280
ok so we want to combine these this
encryption with this encoding so if you

92
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:35,130
start looking at different ways to do it
I chose three and looked at in detail

93
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:42,620
and so this kind of formally presented
here I wrote this up in a technical

94
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,280
report with you know all the details so
people to that they want more detail

95
00:11:50,280 --> 00:12:01,970
crept because that's what you do you
think tax then applied encoding and then

96
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:15,970
encrypt that the second one is back here
we heard many crepes and the third

97
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:23,280
scheme its basic it's the same as a
second team but we make a special choice

98
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,930
or II which next simplify ok so I won't
present their scheme at all here but

99
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,170
that they're all in the report so
there's some detailed pseudocode have

100
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,810
also implemented check that you know
that it's correct URL for that report

101
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,869
and presentation

102
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:57,790
ok so comparing me what I had in mind as
a kind of baseline predicated encryption

103
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:06,490
like DCM are creating new skins use a
single for corruption so they can work

104
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:14,920
on a stream of data which is nice for
decrypting you have to and I don't see a

105
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,339
way to avoid this because if single-pass
depiction is possible that after a

106
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,330
constant number of operations you can
get that first plain text block check

107
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:34,980
whether it makes sense but anyways
because we want our first check the Mac

108
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,920
recording any description operations
there's a nice blog post by Lockheed

109
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,890
Martin Space Gray causes the
cryptographic I suppose so he shows some

110
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:56,790
high security council and you decrypt
before adding yet another notice these

111
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,120
things are more complicated to implement

112
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,410
mentally he which may require new
primitives that you weren't already

113
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:14,459
using and to get good performance you
enter the encryption with the encoding

114
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:21,300
so this to do this on a stream of data
you have really into these things

115
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,099
carefully

116
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:32,080
look at some of the costs and the costs
to the ER because we're doing more work

117
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,200
this encoding step isn't very close down
things by roughly a factor too

118
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,000
so what do we get for it does this by us
in terms of resistance against brute

119
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,050
force attacks so it's kind of easy to do
some estimates by by just counting the

120
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,719
CPU caught the number of blocks
operations so that's what I get to get a

121
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:09,010
sense of so I'm still using acid the
number of blocks and so the attacker as

122
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,330
to make one pass over the site or text
in in schemes to injury and two passes

123
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:24,260
one before he can check whether
candidate key is correct so I compared

124
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:33,340
the racial gender an attacker work so
for every night after operation how many

125
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:40,560
operation the defender have to do here
is a table from my write up similar

126
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,189
numbers so you can see that the first
name has the best ratio so too meaning

127
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:55,840
to defend our operations for one
attacker operation and then it goes up

128
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,470
to 43 which has this optimization I
mentioned it goes back down to just

129
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,230
three

130
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:13,870
there are ways in a yes the attackers
being one operation where the defender

131
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,610
does s

132
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:30,340
in a sec I'm so that previous table you
feel compared to themselves but to look

133
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,240
at some more embarrassed than that'll
give us a sense of how much extra work

134
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:43,400
he talked a lot and this varies a lot
but it's really important and also the

135
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:52,939
work factor if that were the only large
and the file size then it's effectively

136
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,830
the brute force dominated by the by the
kitty happen it doesn't matter what you

137
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:06,510
do on the encryption stuff so I'll get
some reps comparisons here by counting

138
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:18,160
the number of operations so here's a
couple different file size so i ka mag

139
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,100
10 mags hundred bags so the number of
AES encryption operations their second

140
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,540
column so that's chaos as you would
expect that I fix the number two

141
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,139
iterations 200,000 so that's about
200,000

142
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,110
operations

143
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:49,449
so then the attackers you know it out
just how to decrypt one block and do

144
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,710
that idk of two iterations and then in
the next column you know it's the sum up

145
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,120
the first two columns so this is like
attacker has to do and so you can see

146
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,820
that it when you get to about it

147
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,870
file it's about what hides more work and
so that's probably where it starts to

148
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:34,559
make sense with these parameters to
that's that's on the bottom of the table

149
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:49,750
then it's about 70 file so you get more
benefit

150
00:18:49,750 --> 00:19:04,770
it encrypts each page of the database
separately and each page is pretty smart

151
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:11,670
264 s so that extra encryption worry
that you're forcing me to the attacker

152
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:21,010
to do this probably take ATF costs for
other you know for other file types of

153
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:27,290
documents and archives files when they
get there usually Larter this probably

154
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,710
makes sense would improve security but
you do have to be careful because you

155
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:38,780
know if you're interrupting multiple
files with the same password

156
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:50,470
the smallest want to do is brute force
attack with so I that's all I just to

157
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,940
conclude you know pastor facing
corruption still we don't don't run out

158
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:05,060
and start using it and I see how and
where that the third scheme I presented

159
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,100
teens to to give an improvement but
overall the idea

160
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,340
need more investigation and especially
from the attackers so I get some rough

161
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,389
estimates and counted the number of
crypto operations but would be nice to

162
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,720
hear and attackers using GPUs

163
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,370
what is really going to make their life
fired or you know whether there's an

164
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:36,399
easy way to take and get this extra work
so the tech report is this the URL

165
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,789
there's more details that you can email
me or text me later if you have

166
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,370
questions

167
00:20:42,370 --> 00:21:04,139
a 1000 Jeff wow haven't had to go back
to the slide your file size table I was

168
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:11,690
just a little confused about the ratio
holla what step the ratio between that's

169
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:20,850
totally attacker with 1/2 it out ok
because I think what might also be

170
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,709
helpful and useful as tempting ratio
between

171
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:30,690
packard the defender yeah I tried to
capture that over in this table with his

172
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:39,280
real so maybe I shoulda called different
things to different ratios thanks I I

173
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:50,960
now understand ok all questions

174
00:21:50,960 --> 00:22:17,029
the smallest nations for data structures
or not the data that would make sense

175
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:26,350
with this approach so I guess you want
to find a file size that's as large as

176
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:34,049
your application can tolerate it and
then head of group things together so so

177
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:42,158
taking trips small pages so that they
can do random access they could

178
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,289
encrypted database and then the brute
force it would you trade off and in

179
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:59,590
application performance so it's you know
it's gonna bury buyout location

180
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:07,760
supposedly there's not a stupid question
maybe one is it my understanding that

181
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:16,029
you using a steady as I call it a secret
key or one manner

182
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:20,640
encryption I came into a bit later what
you're saying what would happen if you

183
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,809
use multiple see for example one-time
pad as she could Kishore more than one

184
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:38,350
if I can change your life he did to like
first with one out in the man with the

185
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:47,549
second floor or someplace in between
change the the secret key I mean he's

186
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:54,440
involved something out of nothing
ventured out yet so you can derive a

187
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,190
secret keys they're all coming so I mean
that one static location what happens

188
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:09,320
able to change that static elements and
make it a one-time pet

189
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:18,540
management yeah really that the reason
people use encryption is I think the key

190
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:26,180
management to get a file on any device
and I'm just pissed about that in

191
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:32,820
thinking multiple coats your keys

192
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:39,610
is that not correct i mean they're
thinking about anything like that is it

193
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:51,340
a person with that kind of an idea there
are other way it's obviously a nato just

194
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:57,330
come down to managing it will be in the
management well they're really took us a

195
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:03,710
okay thanks so how do you still talk to
us
