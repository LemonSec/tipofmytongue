1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:51,539
no database are a few things I also own
your costs are so high it's hard to

2
00:00:51,539 --> 00:01:21,530
maintain your password

3
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,619
research dot com what site by you my
best efforts basis papers related to

4
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:34,579
passwords and other technologies but
it's always way behind so I'm usually

5
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:39,289
papers are so behind whatever that
currently out there were some of which

6
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,979
are certainly just under surveys and
some of which are more scientific so you

7
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,840
know what's the average number passwords
are persons house of websites that use

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,050
them on you got

9
00:01:52,050 --> 00:02:00,100
but yet today we're going to talk about
worries about this yesterday I have too

10
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,880
much overlap so we're both sessions
you're so what are they very quickly

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,640
it's kind of hard to find

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,390
not once you hit 20 characters of the
past brains

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:18,589
below its weird 13 past three went to
pass the password we just have some

14
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,600
general guidelines usually they're going
to work separated by spaces there is

15
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,769
gonna be some overlap like 100 password
let me in

16
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,260
you know that's raised but it's not
spaces and stuff some people would argue

17
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:44,380
so what's the goal behind past freezes
we need a random password part memorized

18
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,660
as a general so we're trying to find
some sort of medium brown people are

19
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,280
better at memorizing words so our past
reasons a good alternative to that

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,160
there's different types of past freezers

21
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,239
shipments and another one or I would
call pseudo natural language phrases

22
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,670
where they're made up words are words
that are very similar and his talk

23
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,149
yesterday but mostly natural language
learners

24
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,970
people to create their own paths
straight up and they are two hours you

25
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,500
know things like that

26
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,660
natural language structure traces which
is summer like no verb now verb now it

27
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,530
it's a it's a structure but you're
taking words that aren't necessarily

28
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,110
making sense to most of us in that
context you don't buy now

29
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:43,209
think like that mentally chosen at
random words that is why people corrects

30
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,489
corrects

31
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,110
cases where people were more than
friends say hey use

32
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,190
reasons alright well let's see if I
could kill

33
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,890
here at work counting other they're very
limited vocabulary of rabbits random to

34
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,179
them after that and then securely chose
random words which is where you're using

35
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:17,620
a set time and you're making sure that
you in good repair a broken sound random

36
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,150
number generator to such users rather
than hero Hero Arts I'm kind of going

37
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:29,590
back to that work there are lean into
the equation here were problems as the

38
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,119
course like I said people come up with
the same where information thanks

39
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,950
there's a good paper about this little
one notation have a reference section he

40
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,880
really look up the research papers there
is some good information and this one

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,680
was a paper it covered with property tax
revenues and basically looked at

42
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:05,040
Amazon's Haywards Heath prisons so was
way people to be combined with paper a

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,960
pen so what paper but so but they simply
said the secure grade the help you

44
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,919
through this purchase process and so
they essentially tested by simply list

45
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,640
you know sports teenagers cities song
titles things like that pretty much were

46
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,460
able to just guessing here I find a lot
of work papers that were power because

47
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,130
I'm gonna tell you chose it was there
had been a while anyway so that we often

48
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,130
drawing on similar information

49
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,300
random information to make it memorable
which is right in the book is organized

50
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,350
try to make better afterwards

51
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,080
ongoing parameters route now there's
been a lot of your special this year

52
00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:04,380
last year but passed exit from 95 USD
430 standard password exact title but

53
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,460
they're essentially they are despatched

54
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,539
talk about that that's that's the book
online gradebook the rainbow series they

55
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,340
talk about buying or six letter words
were in a bit of 23,000 dictionary and

56
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,179
how many are based on guessing how many
of those words we need to have series

57
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,220
before that offers yet

58
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,130
number one big difference between today
in 1985 is that there were there guest

59
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:45,330
network app on the speed of a
twelve-hour bimodal day that's a girl so

60
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,729
tight

61
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,339
the system that came out in 1985 by a
guy named Arnold arrived home and what i

62
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:56,819
mean it's by almost in the city
basically tells you everything to do you

63
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,960
like this not necessarily just a few
past breezes says here's the list of

64
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,589
words that here's how to generate and
the reason is called thanks where is he

65
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:13,050
recommends physical dice to produce a
random numbers rather than

66
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,740
random number generation of computer I
think the main reason was because

67
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,580
they're not special back in 1985 it was
a lot of great sources for random number

68
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,560
generators that were considered good
random number generators it also opens

69
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,310
up a list of words and roll the dice and
if you're not sure about popular desktop

70
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:44,000
password never seen by the bike so
typically between that simply which do

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,669
is roll her 1955 nice wants to get a
series of numbered 1 through 6 you look

72
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,049
up that index the paper word list and
that tells you what your curse words

73
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,979
need to that b'day words you are going
to use her that pastors priests report

74
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:08,159
and if you ever next three make a splash
backs or something you know if you've

75
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,349
ever been in a pasture discussion on the
internet you got burned it already

76
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:20,240
undoubtedly gonna come up every
discussion thanks katie's he 936 the

77
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,759
actual take you through the setup is a
lot less formal not specific system it

78
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:35,339
was kind of a rough comparison that got
turned into this series which is fine

79
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,919
but the questions are essentially
hearing you know kind of elites peaked

80
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,240
typical or maybe slightly better than
typical password format and comparing

81
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,079
that from an interesting scene points
that's the strength to something like a

82
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:56,680
passed recently saying the comic how
many words you drive or how many words

83
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,140
minimum we should have clearly his
example has for you look if you want to

84
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,890
reform its strength from a total of
eleven gotta figure out that need 24

85
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,910
2000 word dictionary that he's assuming
you're you're pouring his words from but

86
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,689
that's that

87
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,310
and that's also how come he's popular

88
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:27,750
but said that we don't whatever records
dept serve their sites like xkcd

89
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,380
password or password

90
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,510
there's different people have tried to
implement this new system based off the

91
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:46,380
same I do so tax cuts passed passed a
cracking your typical know someone

92
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,260
downloads does your database from the
site your arm or they get your pgp arc

93
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,240
archiver dry or your TrueCrypt or
whatever and they got something that

94
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,580
they can try password passwords that's
that's probably one of our main search

95
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,600
for more pictures online password
guessing there's also a threat but we'll

96
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,230
talk about a while if you're actually
using one's work or lysosomes it's just

97
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,860
not practical to get your password yeah
I'm I'm guessing attack is just way too

98
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,910
slow

99
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,319
shoulder surfing I'm kinda curious as to
whether it be interesting to see a study

100
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,520
based on you know someone's taking a
pass Brees we're using real words

101
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,280
presumably they might be a factor

102
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,680
characters if it's actually easier or
harder for longer but has potential for

103
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
first keystroke logging in the middle

104
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,260
very much compatible with long strong
passwords are you someone has a trojan

105
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,050
so how do we get to mix drinks and this
is only specifically for random pass

106
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:02,579
raising kids were drawn from our memory
or trying to calm things this doesn't

107
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,000
work out the entry is it doesn't work
out quite well so it's much like how

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,510
many characters do we have to drop 95
typical maximum you have to drop you

109
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,189
brought your uppercase lowercase number
example

110
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:24,110
words dictionary is a kind of converts
that church your words your character

111
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:31,110
your combined together to make your
strength so then you take the power how

112
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,370
many words you're choosing to add some
more words course 4,000 words times

113
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,880
power or did you know you have to try to
convert that back strength compared

114
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:55,310
against other password or he's got a
text that total report from to kind of

115
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:03,589
go back and I swear suggestions for
looking at with a supporting the word

116
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:11,580
list 0:44 bits or words they swear has
more words a regular basis by its

117
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,520
protection so what that actually sounds
great some of you are

118
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,350
probably are no relative to other things
how secure that is what we can kind of

119
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,080
compare people left here as fast as we
can talk about the bloggers variations

120
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,230
and the password let me understand this
is a true the password

121
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,180
wonder required or not whether people
are cracking pace they're cracking

122
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,969
things based on templates our dictionary
words they're not having to do that

123
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:51,280
95 forced to try to exhaust that but
this is a truly random passwords are

124
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,890
preparing to rein in past reasons this
is represented as far as its strength

125
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:03,240
total number of possibilities it will
take someone to exhaust that will talk

126
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,830
but remember that doesn't mean it's not
always take you know the maximum the

127
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,530
averages how quickly that maximize your
probably gonna crash but you can kind of

128
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:23,329
see that you know even those words were
getting 25 work I swear stronger than I

129
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:31,240
can I know it's red and it goes up from
there

130
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,950
so whatever problems were patients that
I swear is the words that so if you

131
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:43,880
remember going back right where should
the excerpts of the index's you may

132
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:55,790
remember right site here they've got
some words that got her a better be a

133
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,270
true some of those in their attempt to
try to requirements but essentially with

134
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,449
that or something short of his work are
you also have the opportunity to have

135
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:16,300
five if you're just made it the bat
chance 15 letter characters so you have

136
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:24,839
to stick with that somewhere or you say
well that's not a good posture is

137
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,610
somewhat disrepair and what that that
since you're then eliminating who will

138
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:38,029
pass routes from that pool pool looked
at previously if you know five words the

139
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:43,360
good thing is a big number advocates
like 380 billion or something like that

140
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,870
but as far as the popular can just might
work past three per year limited very

141
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,020
small percentage of those by a board in
his words so how the system like a

142
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:02,260
family member or passed on someone else
you may have to be smart about it you

143
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,630
get five days in a row is that per pass
raise or special automated system or

144
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,709
some type a password reset system or
generating service account password with

145
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:18,949
it or something like that you were
probably guilty but that is gonna have

146
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,020
like a city very small impact is gonna
have some impact on so you decide not to

147
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,699
you I swear default scenario but do tell
you how

148
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,100
it's not terribly complicated Ricardo
signature album programming basic

149
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:42,470
cooking experience but that is something
we talked about this or so during the

150
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,710
Q&A section if you got this sorry about
that was let me know we talked about it

151
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:55,510
so how do we password password is
probably easiest way is to add words to

152
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,340
your list so going forwards right words
makes an exponential change in the

153
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,450
amount of possibility then that are
therefore that passed buries face you

154
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:24,640
can change so I think that was related
to the equivalent of corporate a random

155
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,610
password for you can kind of see you
like it a lot easier for you to say I

156
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,090
take a $9,000 dictionary and you six
words that as opposed to trying to track

157
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,890
down he heard it a thousand words but
it's gonna stay within the forward

158
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:46,480
format but to rub compatibility
obviously you're increasing words you to

159
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,130
returning to increase the length of your
passphrase which there may be problems

160
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,600
probably the systems to try to use a
screen there's also another way which to

161
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,650
modify the worst original form and
always talk about things like that he

162
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,319
made the assumption knows what system
you use they are specifically attack

163
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,109
dice dice where or xkcd they knew you
were a word list they know how many

164
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:17,569
words you have a lot of given what we
try to do that given the real world so

165
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:24,439
just keep that in mind that we're
talking worst-case scenario but you can

166
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,120
better fight words are you doing around
way just say I'm just going to

167
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,510
capitalize words

168
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,140
that's probably gonna buy you better
security than someone doesn't just

169
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,910
because attackers are here years and I
swear words are all lower case if you

170
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,970
have a secure about it however you would
randomly apply that so not every word is

171
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,080
uppercase not everywhere

172
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,199
lower case you're randomly generating
which ones are which which kind of your

173
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,480
word list so you know twenty 2048 4096
so something like this and also added

174
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,830
separators that the space character you
choose on the ramp 3332 other symbols

175
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:17,000
that said that had a little bit to pass
rate so what's the shortest

176
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,570
used as a lot of energy

177
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:33,810
necessarily trying to your past pretty
certain camber plates the bill says

178
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:39,580
Scott Arnold came out here in the past
year the plot cook says yeah really

179
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,750
probably that was twenty years ago we
should probably go ahead

180
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:50,820
36 for normal use so what pages or
market like that because 196 words for

181
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,990
wireless encryption seven days for
high-value like that those are his his

182
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,840
recommendations and you can't go back
that was when we were talking about that

183
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,760
but if he does reason he's

184
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,530
uses is that many kinds of your a past
six months on a website or your website

185
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:19,270
you can afford to have much less strong
passwords then if you're trying to help

186
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:25,500
drive archive you want to be impractical
for 10 years that's a very different

187
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,480
future per but uses pastors to get that
kind of echoes his advice or drop us a

188
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,160
line or their situation modifications I
swear or

189
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,610
congress sources anonymously in a secure
way so they don't they ever figure out

190
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:56,310
where they realistically you just talked
about ready to croak while walking two

191
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,770
things especially with just three words
you doing some modifications

192
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:08,580
probably work out so cracking time I was
kind of passion talk about some Twitter

193
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:15,120
have time that I get that we're not
always special cases where you try to

194
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,120
protect your care about bass hashes like
him hes pods are not going to give you

195
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,719
good feedback they make you a sense of
insecurity is not a bad so here's some

196
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,370
rock benchmark is based on benchmarks
trying to crack the case where because

197
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,449
they have used type of tackle the
password cracker that is slow in nurse

198
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,340
in the cases it probably will

199
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,199
special like I mentioned them
specifically tacitly dictionary with

200
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,900
your dictionary with full knowledge how
you seem kinda mystery box that was

201
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:59,100
wherever snowden caution about this
theory and choose to try one showing

202
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,310
possibilities third person for sex
that's probably realistic

203
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:12,100
governor or Bart very large corporation

204
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:20,560
the G two systems in a GPU roughly
eighteen to twenty thousand dollar

205
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:32,520
investment so that's not beyond the
regular everyday cracker but different

206
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,990
workouts xkcd died square and modified
customer to work with you might produce

207
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,860
an idea we're really talking about
sparse

208
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:55,340
so shortcuts one thing that I had not
talked surely people how biased like I

209
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,909
don't want to get into college just
within a Pats

210
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,179
you randomly come up with the word
endocrinologist

211
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,450
wear with it or not sure I could spell
it right I made to regenerate that

212
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,920
passed someone could gather a water
filtration barbarous the biases

213
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:21,140
preference and then that might provide
them some shortcuts guessing you know a

214
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,620
trooper for suggesting every single
combination might also get lot of

215
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,750
conversation back and forwards specially
the shore of the Raiders you have made

216
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:39,160
it raised its natural language that also
may argue and there were numerous tour

217
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:50,440
company source so use a strong password
or something else so what kind of

218
00:22:50,440 --> 00:23:00,570
resistance there are some people are
polymers that we discourage these are

219
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,080
some pastor policy excerpts from
different places we obviously very

220
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:14,360
recently tried to reject you follow this
course that we were in the right context

221
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,370
with the system so patient outcomes that
just point we grew should I also don't

222
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:30,689
trap of thinking that tracking and
Jeremy and Jen students mothers seen

223
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:42,820
past this which are common freezers
brand names raised gets all weird those

224
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:54,370
are tracking this is an attack on anyway
that's why there's no longer advice and

225
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,020
sadly I had to argue with multiple
people about

226
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,960
that the password you respond to jump
through this but there have been several

227
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,290
studies are pirated here the one
specifically about the xkcd car to know

228
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:17,080
how does that compare to rain here to
announce are trying to use the system it

229
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:27,850
is natural language patterns and other
words like I said just finish up work

230
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,860
here is actually taking somebody's
password was the first three of these

231
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:38,280
and I swear and report from specially
modified I swear modified xkcd

232
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,030
and trying them out it's very different
websites seeing what they had similar

233
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,639
websites you can see the link here in
the end twenty four characters 16 stores

234
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,990
have purposely probably shorter than you
use for a secure system but just to see

235
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,110
how to bring up to thirty three
characters in length is the maximum

236
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:02,090
that's a fairly short there's only six
words

237
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:14,970
so I tried to accept it was a really
great at all but I have interests there

238
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,039
was only one don't they have a slightly
truncated

239
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:26,039
five characters which is not great
restraint it except there's a log-in to

240
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,080
it such that no heirs but you really
need to the first eight characters that

241
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,639
the login and they don't you know that
feedback just literally just try like

242
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,260
the characters and that right

243
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:47,590
$149 with that reducing it so I figure
out what's the maximum so retailers

244
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:54,439
group start seeing a little bit more
restrictions on what you use a new this

245
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,559
year we're going back to those numbers
which ones are which which ones were

246
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:08,070
rejected eBay they also sell truncate
characters they but they did you get the

247
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,549
complexity within the first 60 or they
won't complain but then they would tell

248
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,570
you that password accepted but you can
see some good some bad except other

249
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,620
kinds of characters as separators you
want to have you found signed between

250
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:29,908
your words faces some hats baxley
requirements like wal-mart's well that's

251
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,860
that's not break at least you know 64
work with when you're looking at 12:20

252
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,709
that that's hard to get it past Verizon
network Home Depot order one right found

253
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,000
that they had where I could put percent
signs of my password and it works fine i

254
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,070
try to log in and it would carry out as
they're not publicly traded coating so

255
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,379
five financial

256
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,200
the big ones and again with a lot of
people I know these traditional banks

257
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,409
are traditional financial companies are
really on top of things but you could

258
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:09,639
see again that there was a lot of
restrictions Breeders Cup in Warren

259
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:15,488
traditional order PayPal to cover any
related exchanges and other services

260
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:26,249
they were little bit better but also
some 70 characters so that you're not

261
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:31,309
very specially with our online
application bobwhite applications might

262
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:39,859
be more like you're so when should use
its not probably appropriate case you

263
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:40,829
have a password

264
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:46,629
brain regenerate strengths to have more
security within a short space without

265
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:51,718
rain and strength and memorize it that's
probably the better way to go but you

266
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:55,450
got to regularly check like logging into
my laptop logging into your password

267
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,229
manager or yours to drive those are
times where it might make sense that

268
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:08,429
you're covered quarter that's scary
question some people did you piece of

269
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:13,859
equipment archives much easier for me to
give them a byword past great folks

270
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:24,658
during race if you were here to help
make these systems test these systems

271
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,379
certainly try to relax sometimes that's
based on gender software

272
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:39,718
stricken simple use even requiring
simply use theirs variable like the next

order next flight the proper standard
since the morning essentially say no

274
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:48,399
longer a passphrase a less restrictive
we're going to happen about symbols and

275
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:58,589
numbers and letters you just have all
lower case characters are finished this

276
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:07,200
is my knees Isabella who turns
one-year-old borrow her vocabulary book

277

and work with her right now very small
were dressed or chrome but it seems to

278
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:19,269
be pretty affect the reason reporters I
might be around certainly feel free to
