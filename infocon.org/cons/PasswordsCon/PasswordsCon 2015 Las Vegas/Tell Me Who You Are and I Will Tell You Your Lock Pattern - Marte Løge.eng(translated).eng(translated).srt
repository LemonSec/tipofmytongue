1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
alone is worth a round of applause

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,150
[Applause]

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,370
actually I'm not around and she's done

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,590
some I would say from the ground

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,109
breaking research I don't just see the

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:26,220
sage to mother me hello thank you very

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,040
much so there are not a lot of girls

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,140
speakers hairs of bring it all p for ya

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,530
so yeah I'm going to present the what

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,320
I've been working on for year and just a

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,570
couple words about me my name is Martha

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,989
and 23 years old from go away just

13
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,329
repeating my boxee pieces and then

14
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,920
really excited to be here in Las Vegas

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,129
for the first time just inch up for

16
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,690
hancock I'm completing shop and just I

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,640
don't believe up here so yeah I'm them

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,010
I'm working as a fidel over at a

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,100
consulting company so that's what I'm

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,299
going to do now and I'm going magus so

21
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,570
meta is about passwords graphical

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,380
passwords and I like to look at

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,369
passwords and flexibility and human

24
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,689
aspects of passwords because humans are

25
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,820
really predictable and we're going to

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,040
talk about predictability that's not a

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,570
bit of pinguin cookbooks currently right

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,090
so what I'm going to focus on the

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,850
android catalog as you probably know

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,890
only the right so when you you're

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,890
probably familiar really pincode sensing

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,320
the pass codes and strategies such as

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,770
using at creating a password with your

34
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,280
name your baby bird that's that's really

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,620
known to everybody let people use up to

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,350
being able to remember the password they

37
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,800
pray so when praying pin codes are using

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,330
numbers when you create a passcode you

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,670
use letters and numbers of Samana

40
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,810
meaning to yeah but what about the dots

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,300
are we able to predict what people are

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,070
creating just to no good people are

43
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,750
because that's kind of interesting how

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,690
you can connect who you are to something

45
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:56,440
that I got letters or numbers so just a

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,220
recap of number combination of the under

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,680
panel box because I don't think people

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,290
know how many formations are actually

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,800
are somewhat yes no Kinko's of 10,000

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,670
combinations and the under padlock is

51
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,760
closed four hundred thousand unique

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,440
combination in number is that sounds

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:33,489
pretty great doesn't it yeah just so

54
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,850
what I have been doing is I created a

55
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,610
custom it survey for collecting pattern

56
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,070
using creative patterns as well as

57
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,079
information background information about

58
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,970
the people that have created the

59
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,579
patterns so just looping and I'm not

60
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,730
just looking at pattern themselves is

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,739
also interesting to look at who actually

62
00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:00,720
created patterns so I have collected

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,269
about 3400 patterns use create patterns

64
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,970
from a survey in 30 survey and the only

65
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,989
rang out on my phone so it is collected

66
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,139
from its intended environment

67
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,139
and also ask old responds to create a

68
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,990
pattern for shopping accounts mobile

69
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,660
phone and backing account just keep a

70
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,870
broad perspective oh where you can read

71
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,270
it use so not just to ask people can you

72
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,430
just create a pattern just leave it at

73
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,740
the finish so people have to think about

74
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,970
where the intended uses so just little I

75
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,150
just really like these Pratt because the

76
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,669
dark ones are people that I have used

77
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,120
the outro catalogs before and the light

78
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,880
one is people that have not you see

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,510
under pelvis before and as you can see

80
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,430
for the patterns created for shocking

81
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,580
account and a backing up the numbers

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,010
here are the reactions at the time they

83
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:12,080
use to create patterns so for this one

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,919
and for this one is it's about saying

85
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,479
when you look at this ordinary

86
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,640
difference in time useful training Paris

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,710
so for smartphone people that have

88
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,440
already used the underline homeland

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,220
pattern they were stone the faster maybe

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,910
because actually give away their

91
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:40,789
password right so predictable yeah okay

92
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:45,229
so as I said and the other pedal up is

93
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,970
you cannot use ladders and use numbers

94
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,940
so how can you connect the dots to who

95
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,039
you are what did what power you can use

96
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,830
so i will look at the screen size for

97
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,380
instance hand size reading writing

98
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,760
direction gender handedness to see if

99
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,780
they can impact way we create parents I

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,600
want to just give you a summary because

101
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,150
Oh a new aspect of the

102
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,040
patterns because it's a practical

103
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,550
patterns meaning that it's visual you

104
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,430
can see it it's not just letters and

105
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,750
numbers so I've used a mathematical

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,660
formula for calculating decomposed

107
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,400
visual complexity hope a pattern so to

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,500
creep playing it in the upper both of

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,210
the blue patterns above the point line

110
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,100
but as you can see if you have watch

111
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,070
over someone's shoulder my credit you

112
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,600
can easily capture this one but you

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
should be very very good if you could

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
just look up words that much older and

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,480
have your level so meaning you can just

116
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,180
look at the security in a number of

117
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,110
selected nodes as you do with up an old

118
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,360
password then you can look at the

119
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,910
entropy and the number of select the

120
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,790
characters etc here we have to add the

121
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,100
extra dimension of the visual aspects so

122
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,610
the mathematical formula it's it's just

123
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,000
giving it a sport just give a hint of

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,150
how visual complex the patterns are so

125
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,660
it's about six to forty six as hard to

126
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,490
just give an occasional so a fun thing

127
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,450
about the patterns is that um average

128
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,950
both the pattern is created 3400 they

129
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,980
only reach an average score of 30 grams

130
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,410
each meaning that the patterns created

131
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,820
are not party to heaven the visual

132
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,390
complexity so if you're wondering what

133
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,460
i'm using the cowboy visual complexity

134
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,240
and

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm using the number of nodes get

136
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,420
physical length as well as some what

137
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,020
something is called an overlap I think

138
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,770
its new to someone but you can you can

139
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,299
create a line that's going from the

140
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,849
middle to the right and then to the

141
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,179
other side so then it looks like it's

142
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,500
just won't line but you're actually

143
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,730
click in this one this one the last one

144
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,030
there just look like one line you can

145
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,960
see where you start and end and also

146
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,790
using the intersection so how many

147
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,010
lights crossing so out of this I'm kind

148
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,810
of hopefully initial Lexie so um yeah a

149
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,540
fun thing also is the nobody managed to

150
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,270
create a pattern with the highest priced

151
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,190
it I was like going to send up the

152
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,680
Serbia hope that people will take that

153
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,780
challenge to create the maximum prices

154
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,080
but not bad actually yeah out of these

155
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,690
three hundred thousand-plus patterns how

156
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,640
many actually has an Isaan electric

157
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,930
these are only one pattern that has that

158
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,680
are watchful I don't have the exact I'll

159
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,550
bring up have a look it up but you only

160
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,930
collect it three thousand right so she

161
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,560
won't have it you cannot ever expected

162
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,140
so there is more between the 46 and

163
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,650
point for SL so there's a lot of

164
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,770
patterns above for the highest message

165
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,330
for it they decide clap I will check

166
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,260
that out so as I said it's only using

167
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,270
only notes and I said I'd you don't use

168
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,960
letters and numbers but one thing about

169
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,960
you that you're actually have a name so

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,970
why not sending out the survey a lot of

171
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,000
people cooking that you know my mom use

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,180
the first the first letter in her name

173
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,030
as the pattern so she can be able to

174
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,150
remember it so it's okay

175
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,200
as I look through a lot of I went

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,590
through all the all the other letters in

177
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,080
the alphabet I look through all parents

178
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,110
to see how many patterns are actually

179
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,880
corresponding to a letter in the

180
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,290
alphabet those I was surprised

181
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,380
about them temp from for the samples

182
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,770
patterns correspond to a letter unless

183
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,190
one in ten patterns are actually

184
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,710
correspond to a letter that's if you

185
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,590
know about the person's first first name

186
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,800
and if that is possible to create a

187
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,850
scatter that's what we love the person

188
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,470
actually use a letter pattern that was

189
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,120
kind of interesting that's the same you

190
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,860
can call it using an association

191
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,500
elements for remembering and that's the

192
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,740
same strategy people are using when you

193
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,680
crate up a pattern your password using

194
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,970
names if they love bird you actually

195
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,440
know so you don't get password and the

196
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,630
fun thing about the anger catalog is

197
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,700
that when you know where for a part of

198
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,650
the pattern you can restrict the number

199
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,060
of patterns and that are likely to be

200
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,010
the pattern because you can always say

201
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:07,550
like an old voice so I'm going true all

202
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,440
we played collected patterns and there's

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,380
something about starting out because

204
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,180
it's not it's not random because the

205
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,760
twenty four percent of all the patterns

206
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,890
we're starting in the upper left corner

207
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,110
and about seventy-three percent of the

208
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,240
patterns with either starting in this

209
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,840
one please note and list out our if you

210
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,300
add all the corners you get a

211
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,190
seventy-seven percent of old pattern

212
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,760
selected

213
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,959
so as I mentioned hand sites and forums

214
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,049
in happiness because if you know ninety

215
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,869
percent of ablation of fox or right

216
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:04,459
handed so okay this one might advise by

217
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,729
that a lot of people all right handed if

218
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:10,069
you look at how you hold or by phone and

219
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,489
create the patterns if you for instance

220
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,289
use one hand if you're right-handed

221
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,809
using one hand where you have your thumb

222
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,889
where do you reach on screen so if

223
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,989
you're holding you're using a right hand

224
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:26,629
and create a pattern gets home is

225
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:33,049
reaching up to that corner ok so do if

226
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:37,549
I'm left-handed do a day start in the

227
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:45,319
other corner so yeah either one hand

228
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:47,809
using one hand and tongue or using two

229
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:50,509
hands and forefinger or creating the

230
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,089
pattern that's she open make ways of

231
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,409
creating a pattern so I look at the

232
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:00,439
bright hundred respondents so yeah the

233
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,469
numbers are about about the same as we

234
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:06,649
saw this the blue one is using one hand

235
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,609
and the thumb and the green one are

236
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,979
using it to have so left hand at the

237
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:18,049
port here so yeah that's what I expected

238
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:22,269
it from that the result is so ever so

239
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:31,699
left-handed it's not different that was

240
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,189
not that the risk hope that I thought in

241
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:37,309
the first at first and I was thinking

242
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,139
about

243
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,249
I thought that people that are left hand

244
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,459
will start in the other corner but it

245
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,709
will write up a set and I didn't know

246
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,220
why was I might expect the love that

247
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,869
works really fast so one of the aspects

248
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:59,419
that i mentioned that was sad leave

249
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:03,730
really inviting directions because

250
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,279
researchers have come lad if u % a set

251
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,850
of images parentheses to a person and as

252
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,459
can you remember these pictures in a

253
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,790
team italian rope and people that read

254
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,970
from left right could start scaling the

255
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,730
pictures of the left to the right for

256
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,309
remembering the pictures so the pictures

257
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:31,489
the art had below or in photo or and to

258
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:33,499
write and be a picture the of these

259
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,939
commonly recognized or i remember and

260
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,739
also dis did this with people that had

261
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,410
it and another reading there are key

262
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,419
brains needs if i have a nun rabbit

263
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,549
background you probably will read from

264
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:51,470
right to left so people that probe

265
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,720
ruling from right left we're scanning

266
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,790
the picture and remember the pictures

267
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,499
from right to left unfortunately I did

268
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,660
not reach a lot of people having a lot

269
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,100
another writing writing direction but

270
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,579
I'll super sold here that happen let's

271
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,489
do not impact at all either using one

272
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,799
hand to hand in a right or left-handed

273
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,439
it was the same result everybody start

274
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:22,339
in the same direction so hopefully

275
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,039
someone else a lot of people having

276
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,829
another reading right direction quickly

277
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,189
no because I really strongly I will

278
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:34,069
really believe that you 50 and have

279
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:38,449
asked a set of people having a different

280
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,220
reading and writing direction we will

281
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,949
see a different selection starting point

282
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:47,629
and a different self patters that's

283
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:52,220
pretty cool and continue with that and I

284
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,999
looked at three graphs that's a set of

285
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:59,660
three notes that are connected so we

286
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,439
have attracted behavior where did Hatter

287
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,128
actually are created so these are the

288
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:09,740
set of three grams that are most

289
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,209
commonly and I most commonly used so

290
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,230
this long as soon as is that people

291
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,429
start up in left corner as when you

292
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:26,240
start here you'll probably go this way

293
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,120
or this way so all of these as well as

294
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,830
going through and move next to the brain

295
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,919
as well so keeping into benches people

296
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,659
stayed away from the dyad all right down

297
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:54,559
there people and for Mario all of these

298
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,080
are like he's on the most common end

299
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,580
that lease that lease an example of a

300
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,000
free gram that as a rarely occurring is

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,960
for example going from this node them to

302
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,740
listen up for example or miss want this

303
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,779
one that's possible but people aren't

304
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:21,080
using that one because when you go from

305
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,960
there to there is easy cavotec change to

306
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,870
the other nodes people are seeking to

307
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,120
the edge as well as creating straight

308
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,350
line let it easy to type so we're kind

309
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,600
of able to and just see what people are

310
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,439
actually praying

311
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:54,230
so I have a coupla minutes left the

312
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,700
average length I was mentioned that

313
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:04,480
assessee gender as well as H people I

314
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,200
don't like this result that wasn't what

315
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,050
I expected i wanted it upset but that's

316
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,730
not how it works I can't decide

317
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:32,170
everything but when I lived FD petters

318
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,460
the average length maybe that's not so

319
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,710
different but if you look at the

320
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,500
distribution of that is created these

321
00:19:42,500 --> 00:20:20,510
are the male participants of fiume yeah

322
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,040
so your graph on the previous slide

323
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,500
looks like a dramatic difference but

324
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,660
look at this slide the distribution

325
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,840
looks basically identical so look at the

326
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,540
scale 0 so sorry I was how I was coming

327
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,630
to it so if you look at the percentage

328
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,910
of people selected going for so when you

329
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,700
do statistical testing you're a more

330
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,890
image to kind of a set of just looking

331
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,860
at average when you do statistical

332
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,710
testing you're able to to catch that

333
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,420
there actually is a statistical

334
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,840
difference in the patterns and of just

335
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,680
looking at the others average length so

336
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,860
the women actually created had a higher

337
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,190
percentage of batteries with love life

338
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,060
and that's it and I just wanted to point

339
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,880
out every soul that I don't have an

340
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,410
answer to I do not know why I can't

341
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,960
explain the numbers but on average there

342
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,450
only four percent of the data set

343
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,030
they'll have created patterns of my

344
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:35,150
mates yeah that's that's the only

345
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,640
reasonable explanation but that actually

346
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,110
worked over 140,000 unique combinations

347
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,750
of pattern of leg pain so if only about

348
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,390
four percent of how the people are

349
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,810
creating a pattern of liaison probably

350
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,190
just like we just reduce the likely

351
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,870
number of patterns with 140,000

352
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,010
I just looked at it was really

353
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:15,160
fascinating so yeah I'm just to recap

354
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,530
the age of people so this is the average

355
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,010
and create a pattern Wayne and I saw us

356
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,160
again physical a significant difference

357
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,400
between the parents created by young

358
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,600
people and hopefully people like you

359
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,400
having sex if we practice going good

360
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,750
yeah so much if you look at these ones

361
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,630
is it because people are more aware of

362
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,870
security or is it another why but people

363
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,980
when I ever saw birdie brother trading

364
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,100
patterns and stripes and then buzz

365
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,320
whooping around spring afraid of these

366
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,600
matters when I see when I look at

367
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,120
patterns from other people i know it

368
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,880
like connect four dozen that's fine let

369
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,100
it rip open the screen is very fast so i

370
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:28,240
still have a minute so um for now there

371
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
are there are a researcher in germany

372
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,300
that are have also done a lot of work on

373
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,990
the other fellow walk and and what I

374
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,890
want to do further is to extend a word

375
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,040
about a Markov model for doing

376
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,330
statistical prediction of life we've

377
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,179
chosen patterns based on who you are

378
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:55,660
soft handedness writing reading writing

379
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,770
direction age gender and there are

380
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,980
created a Marco model based on collect

381
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,359
the data from other research projects

382
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,029
but they do not have the extract

383
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,609
information about users so if were

384
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:17,649
imaged and to kind of make a model of

385
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:21,729
different people like a profile are we

386
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:27,340
able to kind of be more successful to

387
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,580
guess the patterns are you afraid so

388
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,139
that's our one of the main kind of

389
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,479
continued at least work because it has

390
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:40,059
more potential than for now this is my

391
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:43,239
master so this kind of pink wrapping up

392
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:47,769
now and I hope that that and also please

393
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,429
let me know if someone haha know a lot

394
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,440
of people with a other writing reading

395
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,080
or writing direction because I really

396
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,330
want to know I want I want to kind of

397
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,749
promise you that that actually impacting

398
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:05,529
patterns I already just want to say is

399
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:14,889
that I don't have the evidence yes yeah

400
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:22,918
we have yummy optimus 2x wow I'm gerbil

401
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,140
we do have okay okay there are many

402
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,170
questions make them very short I can

403
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,570
count would you two questions first one

404
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,320
no no I have released orgy I have a kind

405
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,210
of a summary of everything that going to

406
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,310
be released as I must insist that will

407
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,760
be available it was so relieved of the

408
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,210
data or data I don't know if I'm able to

409
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,760
just give it away but if someone had

410
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,200
kind of a so my geese to use this

411
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,550
information please contact yeah you will

412
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,410
probably some of that for research

413
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,230
problem in all my dog very circusy

414
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,780
regulation small dot yeah second

415
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,350
question whoa what's the good password

416
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,060
once the seal must comment haridasa

417
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,280
better so then what about 26 presentable

418
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,660
patterns we're using the probably fine

419
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:44,710
be sometimes starting from here going

420
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,290
that way and that way so probably the

421
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:52,810
else yeah but these ones are actually

422
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,330
twenty one percent old pattern eaters

423
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,380
started in using three notes depart

424
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,550
these three notes that's why we have to

425
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,990
break help you hear about to move to

426
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,850
mexico hook yes I guess I told her to

427
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,940
submit without call I she got accepted

428
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,340
would call and she's doing this book on

429
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,620
Friday she will be more comfy staying

430
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,020
here with sunday but not small-time too

431
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,750
often questions by your apparel trip ah

432
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,590
I come watch the Pop wall over again on

433
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,209
Friday ethical so Fabio

434
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,140
[Applause]
