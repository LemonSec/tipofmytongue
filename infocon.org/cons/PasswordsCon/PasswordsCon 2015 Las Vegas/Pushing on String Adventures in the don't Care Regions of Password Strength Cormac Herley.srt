1
00:01:28,650 --> 00:07:47,100
well

2
00:07:47,100 --> 00:09:46,380
places

3
00:09:46,380 --> 00:11:45,889
you know

4
00:11:45,889 --> 00:13:50,190
so

5
00:13:50,190 --> 00:14:27,900
so this is a natural this particular box
or no other place for rehearsal to

6
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,030
encrypted

7
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:35,449
steps to go beyond the strength that is
necessary just online attack or severe

8
00:14:35,450 --> 00:15:00,480
bruising not scenario where there's
going to be an offline it is not this is

9
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:09,660
that people here are some of the recent
the reasons for bridges and walk through

10
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:21,219
of course they do johnny was so they
don't listen only true God for ever

11
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:30,230
consulted so that often getting beyond
race was actually both necessary words

12
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:44,070
most of the breaches that we've seen you
know the passwords just in plain text

13
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:51,010
without resorting to any of this drama
and things that way

14
00:15:51,010 --> 00:17:59,270
sensible

15
00:17:59,270 --> 00:20:04,639
online

16
00:20:04,640 --> 00:23:55,440
so well

17
00:23:55,440 --> 00:25:52,940
there's just published increased rate
but you're not getting what

18
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:05,920
but there's a box grater administrative

19
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:39,340
network like 20 percent of employees not
at all like they were here is my terms

20
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:53,370
of you know is it comprehensively beaten
by 11.1%

21
00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:05,959
potentials rapidly dollars to get away
he already have my credentials

22
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:27,080
just like 11 Israeli troops got more and
more just finished their set of things

23
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:36,439
start to shrink wrap or look at it from
the other end respect your privacy

24
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:54,180
got all wondered why the sad thing
essentially boxes or boxes do the work

25
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:17,570
was so without having access to build
cases you know you get to see your part

26
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:28,090
to the claim that place is that came
with the beach

27
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:49,659
internally his

28
00:28:49,660 --> 00:29:02,370
precisely at precise point of view no
matter what I will say is happier or the

29
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:23,120
or one-liners decided that is denied so
nothing is not here yet

30
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:35,350
necessarily you know much much much much
faster than 1% 2% but I'm gonna call and

31
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,850
it was sooo man has this kind of market
reform we will ensure about you know

32
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:49,149
where the New York Corp it all out this
fall which he's control effectively /

33
00:29:49,150 --> 00:30:20,520
445 very small group Relations website
you know then let's say and its price

34
00:30:20,520 --> 00:31:06,410
2011 taxes 2010 and was just online
offline increasing strength and guests

35
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:14,140
will will buy this is the fraction of
compromise that are already compromised

36
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:19,789
well as your 2013

37
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:35,820
so well is that all of us tonight that's
also part of the day that's also please

38
00:31:35,820 --> 00:32:03,970
we're increasing past the regional it
does not succeeded is how we no longer

39
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:34,309
have pretty much scott is a test to see
which one you can do whatever you know

40
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:35,908
down please

41
00:32:35,909 --> 00:33:03,049
he does not influence is not controlled
saying that increasing the strength but

42
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,879
also wants out disasters which ones he
has had over potential additional

43
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:16,189
strength distribution

44
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:28,179
believe this distribution box below

45
00:33:28,179 --> 00:34:01,749
where most or all on like six student
population population choosing ran in

46
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:17,050
four days and still better than it had
exceeded your online social just kind of

47
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:35,849
old harry said groundswell for spare
parts and generally you know this is the

48
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:41,510
fraction of credentials from up top half
of the population that all you know

49
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:52,879
she's got here is also generally well
you know strength is good

50
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:06,180
more is here that the small fraction
facials will be home might get slowed

51
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,308
down at the green car

52
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:15,970
well the creek or appear to be far
better than in the sense that what we

53
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,020
have here it's indoors difference
between the cracks in the credentials

54
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:33,030
she one point where you know get here

55
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,770
posted by Softline

56
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:46,100
well on the Greek or he's going to get
20% off your day

57
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:54,299
4444 doesn't make any difference at all
when you're when you're close to that

58
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:09,230
degree weather was 22% for 400 words
from the same purpose far gone so you

59
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:26,850
have this will cost your hostages for
last year all this bike so the

60
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,890
distribution

61
00:36:27,890 --> 00:37:01,770
like that you know this varies so
there's this is what we want to go back

62
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:18,280
taxes 2012 95 I asked as to what what
what what are the dangers and then

63
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:39,140
there's a password distributions without
beside the point at which

64
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:48,040
well the network that is truly
impressive things like these privileged

65
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,300
access compartmentalization it's not
really something that's under control

66
00:37:52,300 --> 00:38:04,680
you shouldn't have to set up a network
where every user has access to a network

67
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:25,660
where only had somehow things always
managed to creep noise at the match

68
00:38:25,660 --> 00:39:05,629
started making sure that online that
your guesses guess what do you want to

69
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:42,360
be resource but not what they have to do
to improve your so that I can do to try

70
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,470
to pull and that I can try to control

71
00:39:46,470 --> 00:40:04,500
distribution using usual so you know
before he thought was reasonably well

72
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:28,460
the source like 30 we're just good now
can we chill let's say you know I can

73
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:36,910
call that all the way down to six or so
so that that's actually things are

74
00:40:36,910 --> 00:41:25,810
looking at you and show you can do just
the twelve gases in Sao Paulo without

75
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:42,288
exposing all but one of the reasons to
stop talking about people with

76
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:55,650
says his things that we should not
receive your order is hard to get the

77
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:30,959
number 12 or higher are are far more
realistic because you don't want people

78
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:35,089
out there and change the distribution

79
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:45,529
region just don't you try to the
audience

80
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:51,119
italy's passport distributions to his
remarkably

81
00:42:51,119 --> 00:43:03,339
direct focus no words to redirect users
please do this here and here was not me

82
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:34,549
right now focused in the areas where the
guy is well suppose I have some

83
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:42,959
population increase their march 9
percent that just wish it straight away

84
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:55,808
because 90% of the population light of
all about 90% of rappers just wanted

85
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:04,699
when she's on the particular cases there
were just a critical cases all gaining

86
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:40,890
access with with the fewest education so
that is where it is direct and the $1.42

87
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:48,408
that just for the record the harmful
actions so focused only two people

88
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:58,769
people hurting the people who is left
alone

89
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:24,729
blacklisted for protection against are
essentially is first rate for 90

90
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:42,000
position to buy as much to say really
directly address their whole population

91
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,170
by definition

92
00:45:46,170 --> 00:51:12,150
population is so we mention what we want
the distribution go out but we're so

93
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:41,299
contributions
