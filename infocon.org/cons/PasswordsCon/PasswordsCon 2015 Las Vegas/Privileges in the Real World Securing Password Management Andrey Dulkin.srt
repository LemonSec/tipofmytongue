1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,630
thank you thank you hope coming here and
now it's late Saturday for me because

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:34,579
I'm so it's a pretty well so far with
what's going on here and his

3
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,649
organization

4
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:51,010
general sense on the phone cuz you know
around the world and it to write a lot

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:01:13,580
sale they have children have we ever
13400 they decided to get back they

6
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,679
decided they couldn't reach directly say
about biggest and work solely tried to

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:38,250
find some fresh and so what they did was
a trial or city they tried twice so they

8
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:53,399
later they were when they were able to
Prudential by system but we could open a

9
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:03,500
man at work here in a bit her on a
machine is that crash

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:16,780
and they were able to try and get that
warm just inside the network

11
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:27,459
those credentials formation destroyed
information and as far east as

12
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:50,489
permission on CNN's website was also to
the oceans 11 right whale program right

13
00:02:50,489 --> 00:03:07,549
eye roller this program so all they are
now all this due to a single were

14
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:44,340
physically here we are

15
00:03:44,340 --> 00:04:10,650
access to my calendar now pointed out
the formal shoes skirts are love sex

16
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:38,370
secret so when your holiness the movie
rights record in 1995 while now but it's

17
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,490
twenty years ago and instead of the
problems we have today

18
00:04:43,490 --> 00:05:02,770
several high crude coal mines and then
so buy something you haven't done so

19
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:25,900
please go to this website

20
00:05:25,900 --> 00:06:39,799
wow ok so what we're going to start here
basically for us this way that I could

21
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:51,710
think of the vice chest of those created
a great inside the network usually to

22
00:06:51,710 --> 00:07:05,780
gain access to another location we hire
proven natural they steal souls and it's

23
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,869
important to note that the credential
that they're talking about you can be

24
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,280
both jews but they can also be
occasioned potential services

25
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,239
applications every application approved

26
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:30,949
has a built-in network level 2 costs
including personal and our research

27
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:45,810
shows that our jewellery good and I'm
talking to people I provide very

28
00:07:45,810 --> 00:08:05,509
surprised you don't have much more but
basically anything for granted palaces

29
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:28,750
and they don't care about what I don't
write a personal friend we have we have

30
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:43,690
and machine on which all domains are
defined as follows

31
00:08:43,690 --> 00:09:08,970
even have bus were so is ringing you
ever need to try to court so we can do

32
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:17,379
with DNA is the presence of credentials

33
00:09:17,379 --> 00:11:02,600
time and then the machine

34
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:35,490
like this anywhere so we are going next
fall

35
00:11:35,490 --> 00:12:56,710
have network so let's try this question
but if you're tired then click OK

36
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:08,260
real networks are employees and the
majority of the union or hire in various

37
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:18,950
mom so bad things all that part that
event and we're right on the money we're

38
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,670
very sure you'll be able to compromise

39
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:52,780
why do two services administrators and
so we did try to just work station and

40
00:13:52,780 --> 00:17:04,089
the percentage of officers on servers

41
00:17:04,089 --> 00:18:34,149
now

42
00:18:34,150 --> 00:21:30,460
ok

43
00:21:30,460 --> 00:23:06,950
so much so
