1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,250
improve his idea

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:21,810
pretty also if you want to discuss trip
hotels

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:31,238
thank you so when I was over at the
speaker am working away and then my name

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:42,839
is called side didn't I was like no time
to a mentally ill on that little so for

5
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:48,760
corporate services with service i'd ATT
so you're indicating into a server that

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,739
is so who is this topic for this is
where people that are actually making

7
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,260
encryption services that would want to
implement this and for users to know

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,179
that there is something that's really
good out there so there's places where

9
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,229
you can put the keys

10
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:14,560
there's brain wallet where your public
key is generated by your private use

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,150
area from Pastor Cadia the public key
given that anyone can start trying to

12
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:32,799
guess what your passport was key file
this file has your key that you decrypt

13
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,909
password then he service that's where
you have some company has server where

14
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,060
they store

15
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,049
hey so that user generates a
cryptographic key then encrypted with

16
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,450
their password and then that's stored
somehow on server so that's what I'm

17
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,970
actually gonna post about the first one
that's less secure because everyone can

18
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:15,230
crack it he second one that's it it's
harder for users because they have to

19
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,940
deal with like moving with you
everywhere but

20
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:28,329
third one so before we even you want to
run the kto kto wants then generate two

21
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,080
keys the authentication key and the
anchor pinky caviar

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:42,730
82 is done independently so you can
actually get that doing something like

23
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,429
this because someone could just spend
half the time just generate one of the

24
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:57,470
keys or something like that so you feel
like I used HKD oh yeah so I'm gonna go

25
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:06,260
quickly but so these are just some of
the things that I found so they had a

26
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:22,000
they get all you needed was sixty-two
code that but was like top top

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,600
that's now mix there is no rate limiting
or anything so that proton now they will

28
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,540
have dedication key or password
decryption passwords but I'm pretty sure

29
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,980
most users are gonna send password
performances that point X logging into a

30
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:54,429
page maybe you can create the ship with
a bunch of times then

31
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,950
then they do a bunch of extra steps so
if you would actually get the data that

32
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:10,709
major servers you do a lot less
computations so and so did the first

33
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:19,310
part everyone has she been pretty sure I
forget my picture but you have to check

34
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,120
each one

35
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,970
decrypting make sure actually worked out

36
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:40,120
mcgrory who will think so he used to
four different kinds with varying you

37
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,750
can't read that all 800 by 600

38
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:54,020
so and the first one done on static did
it generate like Mackay which it here

39
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,990
actually attacking that you actually had
the data from there you just do the

40
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,610
static want first that generates the
salt and then always use that again and

41
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,590
then just generate the Mackay 1000 and
for iteration

42
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:31,010
trips be used to three times with men
around which is then they use decrypt 10

43
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:38,580
so then they asked that it be actual key
but if your gonna attack this year just

44
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:47,169
get a tax thousand round he became too
so since we're talking about it's a

45
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,240
password authenticated key exchange so
we did you human

46
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,710
but there's a key makes bastardy
whatever mixed in that makes it so that

47
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,580
anyone in between the two and they are
trying to connect you can't like men in

48
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,260
the middle or modify

49
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,580
get any information from that you can't
crack the password from any of the

50
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:24,440
information going back and forth so this
is so the way you would use it is you

51
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,460
would generate the two keys the
dedication key and the encryption key

52
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:37,460
then you would use that you pick
connection than about channel

53
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,060
server would send you an encrypted
master key password encrypted message

54
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,760
then you just keep your master key

55
00:06:47,760 --> 00:07:02,640
can we make this better yes we can so
you have the server whole and complete

56
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,900
blob

57
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,330
all the information that was necessary
from before the agency is the only one

58
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,849
that has decrypting keeper that so when
client comes in you doin dated a small

59
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,960
cup runneth over to be a to sell the
agents and decrypt it then is able to do

60
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:29,609
a connection then you over that channel
he sent over encrypted master key so

61
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:36,810
nothing in between the agency and the
client can man in the middle so knowing

62
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,730
any information about the past where
anything like that so can we make this

63
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,390
any better

64
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:51,510
yes we can generate 2,000 keys and give
me second one back to the server so now

65
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,860
the server can actually have its own
protected channel that it can talk to

66
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,120
decline so now granted the part about
advanced persistent threats on the

67
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,020
server

68
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:12,120
wouldn't help with that because the
endpoint is the server now but anything

69
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,160
from the server to the client can

70
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:23,310
little so changing password

71
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,160
this is actually extremely easy it's the
same exact thing as before except for

72
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,770
instead of receiving the password
encrypted master key you send that

73
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,090
information along with taking formation
so if the server can actually indicate

74
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:44,560
with you then it really hurts that data
center to the data to the server to the

75
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:55,829
store in this

76
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:08,920
the master keys you can do you like if
you wanted to you could you basically

77
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,829
like revoking keys like generating
everything going down all your data

78
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:27,500
recapping it and putting it back so new
user so there is no password that the

79
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,350
server

80
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:36,100
the agency can do the a connection so it
has some would need a public private key

81
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:44,610
pair that the public use they can to be
licensed software and so it would just

82
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,410
you request he kept that can do it

83
00:09:49,410 --> 00:10:04,280
formal thing and then turned over the
information to be so the information

84
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,290
from before when you change your
password that mention over the summer

85
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:21,829
with it he can't change cannot I can haz

86
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:32,150
thank you thank you and that's the price
the answer is yes so the nice thing

87
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,040
about this is if you add the two-factor
authentication information into the

88
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,319
encrypted blob that is stored in
database and how you the authentication

89
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:54,970
for the second factor you but you can't
do any foreigners because that requires

90
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:02,850
the agency to change you know we encrypt
the blog send it to the server in the

91
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,150
server room just feel like it's the same
one and just keep on replaying the same

92
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:21,890
counter for the user so there's YouTube
that universal second factor there are

93
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:29,250
some problems with it there's tracking
which is the combination of a tests the

94
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:40,330
issue the technician at St Station I
asked them on their let them know so

95
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:52,520
counter that in the protocol when you
combine both you can narrow down to

96
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:59,189
smaller percentage that gets you down to
a smaller boat what you think could be

97
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,720
who they are

98
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:10,330
across sites but there is with mitigate
that with multiple counters buckets and

99
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,470
stuff but from the back that's optional
so you don't know what you're buying

100
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:24,710
then the form of a token sport which is
so when you press the button the server

101
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,810
doesn't know who you well when you're
trying to indicate the server doesn't

102
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:34,430
know which dogwood is so it just sends
the first key over any press the button

103
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,640
and then fell the most in the second or
third one and keep on going down the

104
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,480
line this is why there is a 10 sack up
window but that's also problem because

105
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,670
if you press the button anyone else if
your computer is on

106
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,378
yeah I know but

107
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:00,160
52 appears on if you press that button
it literally can log you into anything

108
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,209
it wants that ten second window it's
better to have that button be just one

109
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:14,378
you know I didn't get in I might be
owned or I got in I'm good then there

110
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:21,289
that's basically user president's first
used the right thing but it's not really

111
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:28,869
operating someone could deal with but no
way to fix experts just use the username

112
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:36,139
during registration somewhere over to
the left but that would require radical

113
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:46,789
change and then you just do a HKD up on
that the secret key so but it's it's

114
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:54,019
it's actually really good there's one
really cool thing that can do you can

115
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,619
sign the actual

116
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:05,679
so that you know you know being so more
superficial that would have been

117
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:13,549
detected really really fast it up
everywhere so

118
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:23,439
thing I came up with last year it was
four so I was watching live in their

119
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:33,169
doing their depth PDP and they were like
trying to use the camera

120
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:40,989
QR code transfers and stuff like so what
this is is two team teas that are

121
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:44,579
soldered together they talk to each
other

122
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:51,929
shows up as like a serial port on either
end and basically between GAAP and

123
00:14:51,929 --> 00:15:01,300
forces the protocol so hopefully it gets
a laptop is owned or

124
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:09,819
should I guess you can't go out if your
lap up your laptop or whatever

125
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:19,180
well this would I'm going to shower

126
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:26,599
basically you get your mouth and and
then just turn the light on and when you

127
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,750
press the button then it would allow one
he melted you son dad like a TV screen

128
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,470
with like the hash of the message that
was going to be so they can verify that

129
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,980
you know when I actually do the hash

130
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:54,870
show at the same but you were to use
this with raspberry Pi so you have

131
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,740
Raspberry Pi

132
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,740
ageism and then it's connected to a
server through that but now the button

133
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:14,670
that really is then we can do is this is
the getaway getting a late start because

134
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,780
there's not one that actually does the a
connection and everything I'm talking

135
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:30,199
about but you do this then hopefully the
operating system is it back door but it

136
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,620
is it might have the only communication
it has to be outside world's 30 serial

137
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:46,400
port with like you wouldn't know how to
talk to the team to go but it might be

138
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,819
able to find out so it's not really like
it

139
00:16:49,820 --> 00:17:00,250
this is a security which obviously but
it marriage

140
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:47,910
more drinking yeah I was told that photo
submitted them through this white house

141
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:57,990
is also true we have introduced to come
to them

142
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:10,310
if you know the basics

143
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,370
know with our kids

144
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:42,639
but then I was like this is funny yeah
this is larry if you're into all the

145
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,460

146
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:56,780
given that you're doing take stuff I
knew just how much is that putting more

147
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,240
burden compute power requirements Simon
HSM than is typical of the kinds of

148
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:20,320
devices that are available now so
there's anyway so the yeah because it's

149
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:29,809
just that just smoked turkey stock so
super fast in comparison for this you

150
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:39,590
need to do three Olympic ur
modifications and two editions

151
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:50,139
earth and I just have one we implemented
we designed a very similar scheme for

152
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,890
Firefox accounts the first time around
about second time around about two years

153
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,380
ago the thing that causes to abandon it
was that needing to do the stretching on

154
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,779
the client side before you put it into
the pic with unpredictable like a very

155
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:07,220
very slow cheap phones doing it

156
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,720
powerful desktop machines and we
couldn't get a consistent enough

157
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,370
experience without on that side and then
they also recognizing there is another

158
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,539
other problems where we weren't really
getting as much security out of it as we

159
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,120
wanted relative to the complexity and
the kind of burden you put it on the

160
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,750
client side which is why we then backed
away from that stuff so it's really cool

161
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,659
and there's some practical stuff that
causes problems when we tried to pursue

162
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,320
it

163
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:38,428
more questions I had a related question
was

164
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,700
for pics the server has two stores
verification right yeah it's a bit by

165
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:52,110
and handed over to the agency decrypted
by contained in there and then does the

166
00:20:52,110 --> 00:21:01,899
connection ok ok thank you
