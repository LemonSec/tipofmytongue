1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,370
over last year I should have won by
going all the way up hold lights but

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:37,940
this for the last three days I don't
know today so today I thought today and

3
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:49,959
talking off I fastened together at my
hand them over talking about talking

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:02,420
about physical systems that have been a
lot a lot a smart guy 600 param name is

5
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:47,289
Stephanie and co-founder of those
companies and researchers to give us

6
00:01:47,290 --> 00:02:00,840
till we saw myself as well

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:09,530
that's the shot out to researchers and
did some of these issues have a great

8
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:36,250
fuck up there if this kind of pressure
now to benefit from it was a lot of talk

9
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:50,450
numbers from feel awful retrospective
talk to start talking about what losses

10
00:02:50,450 --> 00:03:01,078
to attack an independent as well so
we're playing with some physical system

11
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:43,709
a pencil number of reduced the amount to
do just as well so so they protect that

12
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:44,650
way

13
00:03:44,650 --> 00:04:21,909
great says a secure safe here put a USB
stick so this is just a little close in

14
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:31,510
recent years but still exists except for
webforms attacks again a little bit of

15
00:04:31,510 --> 00:05:04,289
the man and middle tax or something has
come back to the fact that we've seen a

16
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:13,390
lot of people that I am talking about
our own show broken on Flickr not

17
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,490
organized on that attacks against it is
jailbroken iPhone laws don't think it's

18
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:38,000
important to secure so pretty outside
audit we did disclose it looks like they

19
00:05:38,000 --> 00:06:02,150
are both ways you can create a playlist
but that's it we will check on this is

20
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:16,429
how managers is that caters just will
also try to attack just a courtesy

21
00:06:16,430 --> 00:07:24,830
is so recently were doing this so that
we could protect her

22
00:07:24,830 --> 00:08:11,979
so what does look like a pic to hear you
say we found that will try for example

23
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:24,750
on this long to get the users trying to
to tax check the view is really what's

24
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,120
happening when people write that theirs
is the only thing between the user and

25
00:08:30,120 --> 00:09:26,380
that would be that many times it right
in the scary really scary

26
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:44,530
everything was right there is a pretty
major that for some ice off like a

27
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,949
broken their children

28
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:57,360
attacking I think it's important to have
20 day that does your break every once

29
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,940
told the world to protect against

30
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:13,150
later not to mention or so

31
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:27,550
views do not attack that is calling for
so long and set up to review all

32
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:41,620
comments and we dismissed if you if you
can set the way to do it

33
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:55,750
trying to get into this message directly

34
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,560
1111 1111 of you dress like this like
this

35
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:17,079
another way that you were detected by
this is many many of his loss to heaven

36
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:30,050
on the counter

37
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:45,390
2009 about 10 most are all very scary
one

38
00:11:45,390 --> 00:12:02,310
this is an effective drug abuse is a
problem but is the largest storage so

39
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,650
this is another scary one is this is
this is that the one that only one in

40
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:21,740
the world don't have sex at the end
result he could change that known as the

41
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,250
number of people but they don't even
attempt that should get you that a

42
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,200
second it's been doing for years

43
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:49,730
1234 ok he doubled and jailbroken iOS
literally just there's a lot of really

44
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:58,990
scary last week W that had been allowed
to play with but it's actually much like

45
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,350
the same text

46
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,950
right there to talk about but i wasnt
kitchen with this this is where it also

47
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,590
comes at the end road and rail of time
and it does a lot of times in Lausanne

48
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:28,390
permissions data file for us is based on
the permission of the throws himself

49
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:40,300
they can also doesn't have data what's
it all about that as well so again this

50
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:54,810
is an attack this is where data let's
remember that these attacks by handle

51
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:07,449
myself either because a lot of these
data loss swells are made in 2008 but a

52
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:34,280
lot of them don't there are ways to
settle our disagreements are usually

53
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:43,900
developer

54
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:58,380
so the first one and it's a lot harder

55
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:07,660
very slow due notice that are not be
added to the code is crazy number of

56
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:17,829
that information so it's not simply play
outro playoffs with variable that makes

57
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,000
sense

58
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,090
gather US inflation iOS and how did you
decide against holders it does not make

59
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:36,800
sense I was in office and all state
offices so they don't make it to say you

60
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:50,719
know oh login really obvious their
third-party drivers out there that we've

61
00:15:50,720 --> 00:16:00,120
tested celebrate good carol had that all
these attacks libel against slow jams on

62
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:11,090
fingerprint biometrics that not all guys
have a hard work but really trust is a

63
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,800
lot more

64
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,000
integrations

65
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,390
solo have seen attacks against cutting
incensed when asked do you hear about

66
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:34,480
the stuff you're saying okay I don't
think since I'm sorry I'm worried about

67
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:50,010
any of this reputation for user's device
informal

68
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,649
devices

69
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:59,129
lot of people still jailbreak your
device not recommended but anyways

70
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:17,120
developers potentially volatile rated X
measure so tired is here has broken out

71
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:30,479
is taxed at some really like the rise
all the things or the password and then

72
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:42,919
I would never call and report back to
the site

73
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:58,740
literally destroy that ass the last
eight so it's a really bad we tested it

74
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:09,370
on another way I got like 2012 the tax

75
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:41,500
doing so this is really cool because
it's just he does that he only used the

76
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,169
data that you're asked Logan that's a
really cool I'm a really cool so rather

77
00:18:47,169 --> 00:21:00,679
than put it plans to execute the key and
so forth

78
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:26,179
times when sending over data processors
and various other middle middle SSL

79
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:47,460
other stuff that it stops so the user
can create the data or you can send it

80
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,919
so again I know that his cell is this
end all be all like selling fine again

81
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:03,710
no moral or other networks even after
work all your travel my trip so

82
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:16,820
developers is just on the phone sell for
about 10 seconds you can save yourself

83
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:30,110
basically protection transit outside a
definite in like don't don't rely on

84
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:49,259
this is hell not daughter line 1006 a
lot of a plot to now with things like a

85
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:57,590
webform still kind of existence of
smartphones us and I think the state

86
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:04,929
should remember them well and today

87
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:44,770
available so yes I think that's
debatable but everything else good but

88
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:52,170
never guaranteed so everything is always
do it was attacked us and I was the more

89
00:23:52,170 --> 00:24:49,890
and more different systems different
ways to look at the long course not

90
00:24:49,890 --> 00:25:45,790
break for the phone so that was really
really a lot of people
