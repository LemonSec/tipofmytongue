1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,640
yeah that's what I say hello

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,640
makeup

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:51,650
collection of all yeah alright are not I
do security been doing after I've been

4
00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:09,220
doing it or an idea or related stuff
I've been 20 years have been writing

5
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,720
code for about 30 years

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,240
lot of what I do well here at work in
just about every area security now in

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,449
its coat security training presentations
and I think like that but it's kind of

8
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:33,330
12 started talking about how I got into
security and I got it and it started

9
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,520
about twenty years ago I was working for
this company and i was i was writing

10
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,189
code and I go in every day to work

11
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,570
sit down my computer I find my passport
which was no dog named

12
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,960
numbers like that were called a record
all day

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:03,679
letting the team down inside a walk-in
type in my dog named couple numbers and

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,950
I do this every day and I but every
month or so they would ask me to change

15
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:16,609
my password and so I would you know that
was a wooden cabinet so you know one day

16
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,430
a dog named want him next time it was
not named Juan Gris now sometimes I

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,270
would get really clever

18
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,870
and give it to you you know dog named 19

19
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:40,220
dog named 25 so that was my that's what
I saw was me and boring job so I spent a

20
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,480
lot of time researching and I gotta cut
into researching security must actually

21
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,950
hacking and and I was last night I
learned a few tricks you know how to

22
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,850
reach just tricks and I got this
reputation around the office the office

23
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,160
however they had the things that make it
look like Martin I really was one day

24
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,990
one of the managers came to me and said
they had this problem what happened what

25
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,180
the network administrator at the VP
gotten eric Massa and let the company

26
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,870
but he didn't tell anyone about now the
VP too stubborn to call and ask the

27
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:25,000
password to this matter comes to me and
says he wants me he wants me to come a

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,340
long way to go in and break all the
power to the network and I got thinking

29
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:40,690
about like that wasn't really a new
study why you are doing this and I

30
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:49,280
realize that people have to live up at
work when they're on and nothing ever

31
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,840
you like that pretty good I guess but I
went from one system to another and you

32
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:06,060
gotta go out where there was no soup
Superman while Superman to Superman 1230

33
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,580
Wonder Woman just really obvious spot
where so I went turned on I sent him to

34
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:19,280
the vet this matter next morning I got
up walking up the office the president

35
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:27,750
and the vice president of company just
how I was and I swear they rehearsed

36
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,790
thought about it for me open the door so
I thought it pretty cool you know like

37
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:43,660
you know when I went down side of my
desk and type in my password talking and

38
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,470
that's when I realized how are you know
I what I was at home with anyone else so

39
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,750
I got into scared I got it up at work
and it kind of became my my life

40
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:06,200
hobby really learn about Patrick Donahoe
people 2004 about how the thought

41
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:14,479
process behind it so I that's that's my
thing I don't like yours too and even

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,300
though I've got my passport and I think
it's great that we have so many people

43
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,470
here for instant passwords thanks for
letting me share it really my talk it's

44
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,780
a big raps so thanks for listening to my
rant never had someone to do it around

45
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,789
and complain about work quite well
sweetie like only 1910 sleep a night

46
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,550
talking about so

47
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,830
thinks I'm an idiot so anyway

48
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:54,740
emails from people that want to check
out their power solution and I doubt

49
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,330
that's great you know I love looking at
new stuff and just I warned them though

50
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,729
that this is a graphical passwords and
I'm not gonna be nice

51
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:14,340
always a source came so and I'm never
nice but this you know I hate on you

52
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:22,770
know I hate hearing about my everyday
there's also hate all the time I mean

53
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:30,590
c'mon logging into feet you know so what
time to what time no matter how much

54
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,700
time is spent and how much happier spent
locking out here not the Peter you know

55
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,599
when you walk or whatever and it's just
a huge waste when are so many other

56
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,820
problems that we need assault and that
we haven't saw all these years and i

57
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,570
think thats kinda annoying to see how
many mobile authentication out to our

58
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,900
and they're good you know you know most
of the many of them are are solid and

59
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,190
the last thing you 30,000 oh yeah and
and each one's proprietary each one

60
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,990
don't work with each other and each one
requires major investor in the company

61
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:12,310
so that's kind of what I hate things I
hate press release that thing you have

62
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,390
to kill her and archival research paper
a novel approach never novel both are

63
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,190
great athletes are passe

64
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:29,150
and I really hate the stock photo
everywhere and then if you don't see in

65
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:40,830
re yeah kinda threat and sometimes
reversed so ok so I got the tie and I am

66
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,250
going to get into a contest here

67
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,680
anyone can tell me who or why or
anything about the first password hacker

68
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,050
or when

69
00:07:52,050 --> 00:08:11,840
story ever go away that american cities
you are correct so you get a passport I

70
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:20,400
thought this guy right here

71
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,690
him up at four in the first half but you
thought it was his time showing that way

72
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:34,340
they kept on file separate the way they
kept track of the time used on the house

73
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:46,230
sure about oh yeah sure what the
students air on the doctors he needed

74
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:56,690
more time I'm system so he found out the
file here

75
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:05,630
you a CCENT secret was that all the
passwords and even though he did while

76
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,330
he they had this system where when you
want to pick up and you know it took a

77
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:20,420
while to cure the print job and get a
good start with that you're counting the

78
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,150
name of file you want to pretend that
you can pick it up later so he submitted

79
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,970
that use the system account name and
when picked up the password file later

80
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:45,870
and although nothing at all accounts
that the first that ok

81
00:09:45,870 --> 00:10:04,890
but you know there's ok I i picking up
outdoor speakers it's a good example of

82
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:13,960
going astray and Away We Go research and
7911 patents for graphical passwords

83
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,910
passwords seven and think about that
7911 capped at the meeting that went

84
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,250
through all the way

85
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:37,150
hey I mean we don't really need any more
about 2,100 research stock Harley

86
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:50,890
documents about its just spent way too
much time figuring out problems that we

87
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,839
really weren't really promise to the
first place and really don't insult so

88
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,300
the flight ok

89
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:12,060
grab the password schemes are presented
several minutes already wow that several

90
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:20,329
images you pick one or two that I cannot
lot more ramstein adieu Mon or you just

91
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,580
try it and you'll want to hear any more
and bigger picture or you get some

92
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,540
points on a picture or you drive or
something like that no laws are that

93
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,420
it's a small key states now a lot of
people argue DCC least for molesting the

94
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,839
research papers that say how large the
wrong may think that the Chiefs basis

95
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,650
most of them are based on physical
interactions

96
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,110
limited people with

97
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,440
with visual impairment the parents

98
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,459
you have issues with if there's if you
don't have a fabulous we are grateful

99
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:04,380
environments you can't use it an API or
anything like that I don't promise

100
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:11,500
they're not exact so if you don't hit
the right spot on the screen or whatever

101
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:20,450
or if you do allow that then they're
they're not exactly what it was

102
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,700
basically saying he was like a path
where they let you enter it in 10 still

103
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,370
accept it

104
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,779
pay order to exact where you get a lot
of false negatives the end rejected it

105
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:43,680
has a lot of time these games are based
on a lotta courthouses make a decision

106
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,260
whether to let you in or not you can't
just take like a password hashes parrot

107
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,670
so there are teams are destroying the
house actually have to score in

108
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,390
encrypted form the actual answers are
open to shoulder sir less convenient

109
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,140
sometimes they can actually easier to
type a password then taken pictures from

110
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,310
the screen or whatever moving the mouse
around and they're still faces still

111
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:17,050
have the same weakness is now

112
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:31,469
spend fifty years and we really haven't
made a lot of progress on passports I

113
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,570
mean we've kind of things to come up
with some some good ideas and some of

114
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,750
the policies are things of relaxing we
keep our limit smarter and Angeles mara

115
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,579
how to do things I remember once an
analyst at about fifteen years ago where

116
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,969
I i talked about the past were like
that's all that really matters to talk

117
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,420
about complexity character says also you
know if you have the password that

118
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:03,719
really doesn't matter which character in
there so much from that so anyway it's

119
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,660
taken a while just to get that you just
the basic things down i mean we still

120
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,029
having secret question worth asking for
your eye color and its

121
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:17,820
we still have long been more difficult
problems so I was thinking that it would

122
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,250
help if we had more standards they said
give us figure out really what our plans

123
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,850
are what our weaknesses are and go from
there now that we know where we need to

124
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,520
spend our effort

125
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:36,860
authentication standards are a number of
you may be her final i mighta security

126
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,209
coalition and there's all these
competing groups friends shares of

127
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,859
course the fight alliances got quite a
bit of industry support but they're also

128
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,690
lot of other groups trying to establish
standards but what we really need your

129
00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:00,790
metrics the TV alliance that are looking
a TI for communicating but the metrics

130
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:07,800
are really what tell us what what's
wrong with our systems either RRR

131
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,649
mechanisms for authenticating really are
and where in the way we think there were

132
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,019
its guidance for developers that helps
you when you want to purchase products

133
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:29,990
and you understand really just you you
want any system very own so lol and

134
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,450
that's ok this is what happened we got
standards ok so this is a patent account

135
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,760
Monday fingerprints you know people
don't like fingerprints oh hey someone

136
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,149
to have a great idea

137
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:46,870
fingerprint on a device in a little
finger prints you got you got finger

138
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,120
prints but a device that get the best of
both worlds

139
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,990
you get the worst of both worlds but so
anyway when two groups is IDs nails done

140
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,500
a lot of work on standardizing come up
these metrics coming up with these

141
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,970
principles guiding principles for how
medications happen it's still really

142
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,740
unorganized it's still really much very
much at seven see but it's the one i've

143
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,270
seen

144
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,069
has the most potential I think we we as
a community should participate in that

145
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:28,050
and and guide the guide the way the the
direction we take on medication but

146
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,729
beyond what they they've established
we've got accessibility issues i mean my

147
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:44,339
10 year old cell phone my father and his
cell phone when there is so you know

148
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,620
identification going through SMS to work
with him

149
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:55,899
there's legal issues there's ethical
considerations for example using

150
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,270
biometrics and enrolling people without
their knowledge

151
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:06,040
Facebook has done this where they they
use behavior analysis to see if i

152
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,449
understand that really you were at work
on the side of interactive site that's

153
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,650
kind of a light example but the company
could for example

154
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,310
take pictures as you're walking in and
use that and really basically into the

155
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,260
authentication system without your
knowledge is also cultural issues

156
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,500
there's also issues like some people
just don't like touching his let people

157
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:39,750
touch so a fingerprint scanner may not
be a good idea that so design

158
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:49,700
i'm ok so anything we need to
reestablish well design patterns we

159
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:56,670
we've done things we said you got to use
a hash hash got a certain processes you

160
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:02,420
go through your password resets but we
still have secret passion all this

161
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,100
things tokenism attribute why it's not
area where you don't see a lot of

162
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,699
talking about that

163
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,000
multi-factor authentication people still
doing that wrong what you have course

164
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,530
factor there's an issue here with
usability and like I said my my father

165
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,320
in law and my 10 year old I mean do we
have we don't really have systems or the

166
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,590
door early work like that you don't
really understand computers very well or

167
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,020
who are too young or may have other
disabilities we don't really have good

168
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:43,240
ways to scale that though their user
base user base scalability I have my key

169
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,370
chain has like 10 tokens on it you know
hardware tokens because I like her

170
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,199
cousins but

171
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,000
so

172
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,990
you know that's only go so far we have
some hardware tokens and to really have

173
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,780
that security you gotta have some kind
of way to make this work on a user scale

174
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,639
basis

175
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:20,270
lost recovery recovering from your token
or took a break into wearing down a lot

176
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,879
of companies allow full tokens but they
only let you use one at a time

177
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
choose in a place where never met that
they only let you pick one and only nice

178
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,410
if I could use hardware token my login
with a different Ogunleye login from

179
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,540
work and make it to production 110
occasion Google number

180
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,159
the top number wherever when I love my
phone and it would it would be nice to

181
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,260
build tokens one thing that Google
supporters is having multiple tokens

182
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:03,510
when you login so you lose one you can
have a backup one to recover

183
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:10,629
factors be nice to be able to more than
one so we want it but the thing is that

184
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,220
we really have an established guidelines
crowd and you know that we haven't

185
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:21,150
really set you need to support multiple
tokens you need a support this this man

186
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:29,070
amount of security just like last time
you login with your YouTube hear

187
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,120
something that on your phone you just
live in a home

188
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,110
and it goes it lets you login with that
you don't have to write your phone is a

189
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:48,219
second factor but you can lose your
phone so I missed some good stories so

190
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:56,840
under a good story is my conclusion is a
story so nice to my kids and my

191
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,080
passwords behind my back like common
passwords and I just passed but less so

192
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,689
on time

193
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,310
years ago I was I was doing a sales
meeting with a client and that it's and

194
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:14,830
and I i was actually did you start times
by kinda like this but she typed this

195
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,830
pattern I recognized it you know admin
123 and I knew this past year so well

196
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,050
sound of a typo sometimes it sounds
really distinct

197
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:30,100
were added and once it's very quiet
person in the whole room burst out wow

198
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,389
this Ad Meter bright red like a good
skill to have

199
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:44,570
so I didn't get the job thing so anyway
i mean a world of Secrets we've got a

200
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,290
skirt but we really haven't you read the
mailing list and they're saying the same

201
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,950
problem

202
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:57,970
discussion that we're having today we
kind of need to hear contribute guide

203
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:04,360
the thinking in the guide to research
and write blog posts and and and missed

204
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,449
out where where we could hurt what are
the problems that are unsung that we

205
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,309
really haven't solved yet many blessings

206
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:23,639
I noticed that you use the example dog's
name any time without ever telling us

207
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:30,719
the dog's name is is that some pattern
change

208
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:51,100
yeah I'm way sigh I'm just gonna ask you
well for the last well could be

209
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,129
interesting since we're doing light hard
questions what are your views on the use

210
00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:02,269
of janitors key rings for multiple
physical done a great idea about where

211
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:14,220
I'm going to move into one of my sons a
country like six cell phones I gave you

212
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:21,499
know they have to deal with me so I gave
my token to log into the site but a

213
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:28,879
chain on it was a big long chain next
big lunch a nice guy I should I sit down

214
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:37,379
with Jen things so much action has done
a book on passports I remember purchase

215
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:43,928
not online just how to read and that ten
years ago and still out

216
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:49,840
must develop today I mean I I have no
better answer than that you unlike white

217
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,408
we continue getting stuck but one thing
I have a service that a common thread is

218
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:59,970
when people start talking about you know
they always started what's wrong with

219
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,809
passwords if you wanna get rid of them
better off making a list of what's right

220
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,899
because it gives you a better
understanding on everyone has climbed

221
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:13,219
into the ring with them in the last
quarter-century everything that's right

222
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,070
with the idea is that they nuts it's
always possible broken so hey let's give

223
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,408
us your place and then the first lot
closer with a broken leg in pictures but

224
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:26,580
see the thing is

225
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,990
if you're gonna do pictures you might as
well just think oh you know the pictures

226
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,940
you know Apple

227
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,830
whatever battery and right up there
where is your password if your gonna

228
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:49,590
happen member what there was any way you
might know it but yeah movies like you

229
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:59,658
know obviously all I watched those
movies what's the password was the past

230
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:13,870
work or doctor gore fest but Josh and
then what we seriously need to do a

231
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:24,070
petition for trivia about Chinese
passport checks no on Zion Zion 0 person

232
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:44,678
he said that's just yea on different
accounts nuclear launch codes for the

233
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:54,120
USA 1080 ok so I got
