1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
keep this is a cheap way of doing
account account recovery is all of these

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,759
online services

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:23,030
your bank down the social networking you
name it they can solve the problem

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,660
automated way with some sort of some
sort of

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,980
yeah that's kind of like posi rear if
they have to say after a call center

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:43,540
with people or online or lenders direct

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:52,780
other account every time I mean reduced
cost to the talks a little bit

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:01:06,100
you can log into their accounts it's not
a great cost everybody is reduced to his

9
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:15,509
credit to their people that bought
remembering they just depend on it

10
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:23,530
caesar's they don't know

11
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:37,820
account recovery are basically break all
really another password for another set

12
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:45,460
of passports your but it i mean all the
things you tell people not to do with

13
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,740
passwords we just do it for the safe
just do it for security

14
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,220
upper and lower case letters and special
characters all those things but his car

15
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,119
is questioned your mothers need no one
of the past

16
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:23,470
no complexity but the answers to these
questions are things that you can find

17
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,030
online

18
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,420
worldwide

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:36,089
these ancestry and who knows what the
people that you'll p.m. data through

20
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:45,550
alot were very very protective

21
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:54,750
don't share your password multiple
websites but how many websites are your

22
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:03,780
best friend childhood best things like
that I mean this is another story this

23
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:13,900
is harder very hard get information
actually hard storing passwords but no

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:22,320
passports want assault on security
questions sometimes you need to be able

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,970
to do it and you can salt

26
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:39,120
so these are more vulnerable now with
with apologies

27
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:52,880
here because we're reading practice
practice has been so party-led and you

28
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,060
know i i asked Needham Heights evening
by reducing

29
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,990
where it's like this

30
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:20,090
you don't so so it's really hard

31
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,450
de Lisi

32
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:37,580
once

33
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:52,490
I don't they have a cheat sheet choosing
and using security question says

34
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,950
it says

35
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,409
you know a number of things about them
but one of their objectives here is to

36
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:08,230
forget password seasons ago if his
making political really focused on

37
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,790
ratification

38
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,190
there now hope is making a strategic

39
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:23,860
as

40
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:35,910
other than other sectors that asked
questions

41
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:44,510
and I have there but then if you read a
little bit further down there and it

42
00:05:44,510 --> 00:06:01,530
scares me a little bit more because it's
talking about possibly be and challenge

43
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,190
but

44
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,190
anything that

45
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,740
formal

46
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,100
so

47
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,230
yes there were unwrapped

48
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:26,530
one is one thing I never saw her to
questions and give you the option to opt

49
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:26,880
out

50
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:45,120
it's always like you must now so
security for you to make up for not

51
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,500
representative of the population

52
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:10,320
example most people don't realize that
they can good chance the danger with a

53
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,099
clear answer is that he gets the
password and hit me up into through

54
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:24,090
security but then there likely perhaps
more like this research that indicates

55
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,380
that different methods of doing it

56
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:41,960
people even forget and that's a secret
but one of the issues here

57
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:52,409
site using security but that's the way
you don't have the answer to the

58
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,139
security question

59
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:06,680
you're referring your limit because they
don't exist as a person is the challenge

60
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,460
questions so their homes

61
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:22,460
so let's remember when we talked about
this so many times brought up I always

62
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,560
heightened security but let's remember
when designing that we are not designed

63
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,990
for ourself designed you were the
general public and we need to be

64
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:47,060
thoughtful about how do these things
everybody not just as an example of an

65
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:54,770
area where I actually that they
shouldn't make up an answer to this

66
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,670
California Department of Motor Vehicles
registration

67
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:10,719
I had to go through this I get my
drivers license on their site and which

68
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,260
you would you do to counter and I don't
know if you can see all this but it

69
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,480
talks about

70
00:09:21,480 --> 00:13:56,140
folks that we had so much

71
00:13:56,140 --> 00:15:58,030
yeah sure your work so well

72
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:19,430
but it's also a problem or use a lot of
requests more than one right answer that

73
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:38,729
a number of the sites I kinda like that
because I applied since it didn't get in

74
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:53,840
so written but most of the supplied
canonical decision there were lots and

75
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:17,140
lots of dresses very hard to not like oh
yes yes sir and another bear in mind is

76
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:28,810
that part of strategy is you don't want
a lot of people get one makes traveling

77
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:48,690
work against the user like right now so

78
00:17:48,690 --> 00:18:05,960
you have talked a lot about what are the
things that i very dirty but maybe

79
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:26,580
something just so your e-mail subject
but if you're going to do that perhaps

80
00:18:26,580 --> 00:19:03,870
you might want to ask ordered at least
at some like me you know something else

81
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:23,350
not and remember that sometimes actor
isn't inside we're just want to get in a

82
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:39,039
bit more settled and inside there's been
a lot of really good academic really

83
00:19:39,039 --> 00:20:02,119
much more rigorous research your other
people much more

84
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:37,458
block Valerie buttons and it will close
with what they already put up on my

85
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:38,599
story

86
00:20:38,599 --> 00:21:07,720
their quest know how much more secure
another but so that's that's it

87
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:20,200
over Peter for the microphone the the
paper a security question was what is

88
00:21:20,200 --> 00:22:10,419
your favorite Internet industries

89
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:34,210
yeah I don't I don't like a lot of you I
guess

90
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:41,020
right
