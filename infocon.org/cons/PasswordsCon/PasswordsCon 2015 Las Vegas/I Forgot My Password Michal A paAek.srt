1
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:02,460
you can also call me michael i made this
is Joe going two years ago but please

2
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,420
don't call me Michelle I hate that the
Orient and I'm Prague Czech Republic so

3
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,110
the east coast and beyond its pretty far
east coast from here I like to talk a

4
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,220
bit about fossils recent speech r us on
the web sides and slightly was all about

5
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:32,340
users and best practices near future as
well so I talk about these are so you

6
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,729
know we forget stop right there also
forget the boss or its because I just

7
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,310
don't remember them and that's really
hard on it you guys are forget password

8
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,149
just raise your hands all over your
password

9
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,909
well just play almost everybody so we're
still in the UPS they need to have the

10
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:59,139
possibility that features for some
reason so even if you are using fossil

11
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:03,979
manager Richard guess that most of you
do then probably needs to have the

12
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:10,380
possibility just so now plus or visit
mechanism can also be good for security

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,630
of your account I one case from

14
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:20,359
Republic is a company called agenda in
the yard a new number service they

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,690
provide the number service to users and
they don't have made it possible

16
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,109
mechanism for some reason we're just
going to go to the website and a reason

17
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,909
to possible for you to buy me a good
thing

18
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,890
well unless something bad happens in
this number last year they had to bring

19
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,298
it to a stop at the bridge and the
attacker was able to access 125 K or

20
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,980
passwords stored in plain text

21
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,840
fortunately the nato was not made public
yet so that's why sorry hun doesn't have

22
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,420
a phone but maybe one day they will they
try to sell it on some underground

23
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:12,899
forums but nobody was really interested
in doing so they gym had their reasons

24
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,450
for possible starting line dance like
performance in the gaza client support

25
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,798
and they also made some bad decisions
like they didn't properly separate data

26
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:36,930
but just not just move on so they didn't
have the buses results could just yeah

27
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,189
automated buses visitor just because
they don't require users to enter their

28
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,700
email address for some reason because of
a privacy I don't know what so they say

29
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,268
they don't require an email address they
don't have the others to send a link to

30
00:03:52,269 --> 00:04:00,640
a risk but their possible mechanisms
manual you need to write an email and

31
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,670
say hey I forgot my password them up and
they will reason to possible for you

32
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:12,179
manually but that doesn't scale well if
you don't like 100000 2012 recent emails

33
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:24,830
well then to the scale so what could
they do and what they date they could

34
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,590
just be the deposit insurance for all
the users and send them to a recent

35
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,590
links but this is what they did instead
officials there you know incident

36
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,060
response and then was it a just issued a
book both anticipate being mean you

37
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,620
should change your password now

38
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,949
and that's it so some of my friends have
lost access to their homes because you

39
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:55,100
know you don't get booked posts most of
the time and so he sprang to mind they

40
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,510
just didn't have enough to change their
passwords so somebody else but for them

41
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,969
already and now they don't have any way
to recover the account and they said

42
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,400
that they don't care because of decided
having really bad security practices

43
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,870
that they would just need it so losing
customers because it's actually a paid

44
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:24,460
service so they're losing customers just
because of security so they should just

45
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,180
make any email at least optional so if
you maybe you may optionally state the

46
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,490
reason why you actually you know what
you want to email for the users from the

47
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,850
user's just say whatever just email
optional and stated hey media messages

48
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,760
because of this and so they the benefits
of adding one or two email address so

49
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,909
what do you mean benefits

50
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,590
well we're talking about possible to
meet its so well it should be a possible

51
00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:02,210
reason so the company or jumping castles
visiting to the users and if they forget

52
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,130
the password or into services or is
there some security incident since then

53
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,539
the reasoning to do you know that you
know quite clear benefit of ending an

54
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,719
email address so just a quick recap

55
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,169
deposit recently action looks like it's
just I mean really intend on not random

56
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,448
random random random never went on
earlier in the

57
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,900
it shouldn't just look like endometrial
it should be like 16 + bites your friend

58
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,279
and neither should expire in several
hours maximum one or two depends on the

59
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,360
on the service and it should be visible
only once so if the attacker actually

60
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,860
gains access to due to the recent linked
somehow they can just use it in a

61
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:59,089
limited time and just being allowed to
use it for the token in the database

62
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:04,120
stored in the database remember this is
a token this is the password first its

63
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,909
limited in time and in poverty has quite
high and soapy so it's not use of pasta

64
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:13,990
or so he doesn't need to meet its
locations can be slightly pasta dishes

65
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,939
like the one in this country it doesn't
need to be a secret because it's just

66
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:27,849
the random data also an email with
deposits resulting should contain some

67
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:32,289
more additional dates are for example
the IP address and the city from where

68
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:36,740
it impossible to imagine it from because
then the user can actually tell if it's

69
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,709
just him it was human rights reserved
his password remember that if it was

70
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:50,889
just trying to bring him or if it was
something different country

71
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:56,009
email should also contain a link to
invalidate the token because you know he

72
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:56,899
gets banned

73
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:01,909
emails with recent talk and then
probably something is going on anyone's

74
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,880
invited its ok as soon as possible

75
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:15,980
sometimes some bad guys are actually
abusing this feature to see whether the

76
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:23,490
user or a neighbor has been using the
service as well so yeah thank you I have

77
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:33,289
so if you are running containing side
for Ashley Madison inside you probably

78
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,789
don't want to disclose as much
information as you are running a visible

79
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,439
sign of the times it doesn't really
matter because you can actually tried to

80
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,650
sign up for decide the email address of
the neighbor and they will anyway see in

81
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,040
the other assist for any registered or
not so was the dance doesn't matter but

82
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,000
if you are negotiating side you probably
doing something more for the privacy of

83
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,550
users using the email address is 440
sign up but just use the names of the

84
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:12,969
user names not so you know one thing
which is really important is to limit

85
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:21,160
the number of things that can be made
from a single IP address from me and the

86
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,230
thickness actually trying to enter
married only uses from decide everything

87
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,520
is limited

88
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,010
just in case someone is trying to evade
them using the possibly that features

89
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:42,819
here is what you should not do you
should not just the region carried the

90
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,250
password or generate the new password
and send it by e-mail to use their

91
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,960
fingers if you knew then if I'm in the
office and I see that the guys trying to

92
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,930
the guy in front of me is trying to look
into a website I can just go to Brussels

93
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,329
feature and ready for a quick 78 or
signing I can just reason this password

94
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,720
and he was like oh my god somebody's in
my possible avenues this new one and

95
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,250
then I do it again and I knew the game
again

96
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,970
again so namely me somehow the service
of the side with me tonight for them so

97
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,400
it's kind of like the local dose for
them so they cannot be they cannot use

98
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:26,160
the side and just go elsewhere although
you shouldn't be sending the region last

99
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,300
word you know back to the user because
you have it properly so you can do it

100
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,209
anyway right

101
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:46,680
interesting ways of preserving password
I have seen was this one looked kinda

102
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,400
random but it wasn't there and what they
did was they should to be the email

103
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,050
address the user and they included and
then send it as a token to the user and

104
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,089
it will send back to decide when you get
into token and then the fund the user by

105
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,250
email that it was thinking people to
token that looked kind of trend oh well

106
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,290
but I'm fortunate to decide could be
easily and it wasn't looking to source

107
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:21,699
code as well so easy to see the exact
algorithm encrypted well it was also we

108
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,210
can you going to graduation including
encryption keys so anybody could just

109
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,980
you know generate their own token and
make good reason to possible for any

110
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:41,880
news on the website so just use a random
random random random random

111
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,260
sending two tokens or deposit reason to
my email is this is from Google

112
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,990
transparency report on email and they
say no

113
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:57,050
slightly more than 50% email coming to
gmail is encrypted using the start to

114
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:03,500
your house transport security thing
that's just not enough 100 or even more

115
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,760
probably like 110% just in case

116
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:16,930
so even if you'll send the possible to
recently when he goes to https in a

117
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,140
website then there is a high chance that
the email trouble as the Internet in a

118
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,449
in a plain text form so anybody can read
the ruling or even change it so it's

119
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:35,250
just not so you can use this website
start the other info to check if you own

120
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,650
enterprise data users start TLS
encryption or not this is sort of like a

121
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,319
celeb server check but for email they
also get breaks they don't have a

122
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,640
process known as I know but even if you
score a in this one doesn't mean that

123
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,100
from end to end it means that only when
it's coming from the up to Sarah and

124
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,280
between the service but it doesn't mean
that it's not going so even if you are a

125
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,740
great just ask your provider can still
redeem Nile you got its start in there

126
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:23,520
in plain text also sending email us
really depends on the DNS to weaken your

127
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,400
account is actually predicted just buy
it just

128
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,470
this is not paid within this is what I
was talking about ready this is how they

129
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,590
tried to get around the problem is the
amount they owe you to upload your PGP

130
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:47,580
public key and then they will its own
opinion on the website so fundamental

131
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:54,160
section in the ability to adhere PGP key
and they will include all the

132
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,579
notifications they they sent you and
somebody comments on your nice big chill

133
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:06,280
pill yesterday then encrypted but they
will also increase the fossils tokens

134
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,910
and the emails to possibly as a token
everything will be encrypted using PGP

135
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:19,819
so we can only hope that anybody would
want to access your email is anybody up

136
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,090
using it already

137
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,240
ok much but because you might be using
Facebook

138
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:37,500
ok to more so it is already tried to
work around the problem there could be

139
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,340
some other options for example is the
record messaging library library which

140
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:52,020
is supported out of the box and several
instant messengers and it does

141
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,069
encryption authentication perfect
aristocracy and everything is also

142
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:05,550
supported by the library is also
supported by job by then I think Simoni

143
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,410
and some other languages so it could be
used by delivering it could be used for

144
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:18,680
delivering the talking you can just
create your contact the server and the

145
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:27,280
consent of the user users need to be
brands brands determination so that they

146
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,480
can actually receive tokens but this is
an end-to-end it's like a BTB representa

147
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,590
but might be slightly easier for the
user just because the set up on me

148
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,780
because the set up on the client side is
slightly easier if you don't need to

149
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,899
generate just

150
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:51,290
confronted you know there are some
shared secrets I actually wanted to

151
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,439
build a concept but I didn't have time
yet I have seen the API library I'm

152
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:05,480
seeing the jesse the library and it look
easy so I tried to the let's see how

153
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:15,639
this could also be quite easy option for
you would be to disable the password

154
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,459
resets completely he was if you don't
remember your boss or because you are

155
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:29,050
using fossil manager right then you just
cannot forget the Obama stored and then

156
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,689
you can have this feature is able

157
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:35,920
just a few was implemented in C or at
his be sure that you get to messaging

158
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,069
right around this feature because if
like a regular user would be able to

159
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:48,618
possibly could for like it could be a
long way actually to protect these

160
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:56,850
accounts disabled possibly in the ideal
world who look like this probably much

161
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:07,370
better design but the application should
provide selection of various selection

162
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:11,479
of transport hope to do the talking to
the user and/or user will be able to

163
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:23,059
make one or maybe two visitors can also
visit picture or video by email

164
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:33,450
just regular or PGP email for example
some other transport modes transport but

165
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:39,080
come on one's for example like Skype
it's not really possible to put a third

166
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:46,949
party to send a message via Skype
limited way because it doesn't like you

167
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,950
can try to web interface it's anyway he
said

168
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,890
API's monday might change

169
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,540
do that and also one thing that guy
business they are scanning the links

170
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:07,310
which are being sent over Skype network
so if you would do that you definitely

171
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,700
want your talkin to me more than once
they are trying to skin to skin dealings

172
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:19,160
also for the briefing was handling my
skype its right to make a damn thing

173
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:33,030
they just one thing you definitely want
to do is to notify the users under Basel

174
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,550
rules changed if they don't know their
possible change they cannot do anything

175
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,310
about it well possibly change when
someone else they kinda do much but at

176
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:49,310
least they know about it so definitely
in the applications you need to find new

177
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,290
uses and the possible change also be
sure to get the messaging cry because

178
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,460
it's over we have just change your
password and they don't remember that

179
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:05,020
they did it five minutes ago it's going
to be quite but putting us up might also

180
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:12,570
be possible to you know use the Google
verification feature an interview with a

181
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:18,429
justification and this kind of stuff to
confirm the password change you know

182
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:24,270
just use it for looking verification by
those costs or change verification or

183
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,600
something like that but I'm not sure how
this would work out for the cases like

184
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,949
when the device is lost so I'm not
really recommending it right now but it

185
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,720
might also be a chance especially if you
are running the application we don't

186
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,120
like to be there to have a website and
application so they could use it for

187
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,668
possible change medication this one

188
00:19:48,669 --> 00:20:00,409
last and if you try to store some some
companies are anything like okay when

189
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,029
the user's trying to log into their own
passports

190
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:11,840
straight into the database so that we
can see if it's or not usually users say

191
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,470
they are typing their password and they
can just type it and if they do get

192
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,109
stored in the database and one somebody
has access to the database just because

193
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:27,389
of security vulnerabilities or victims
getting lost it can easily be coming to

194
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:33,039
Boston from just reading the defense is
quite easy I guess anybody would

195
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:40,820
probably no passports which was probably
supposed to be here right now so just

196
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,200
don't do that i've seen

197
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,940
really applications that do not have the
same idea 10 years ago as well I decided

198
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:57,799
it's not a good idea so please when you
are in many users to recent gains just

199
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:05,509
type of thing beyond email and beyond
basic EPS so that we have more secure

200
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:11,049
possible things so that's it from me
thank you very much

201
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:32,320
questions should then

202
00:21:32,320 --> 00:22:38,168
yeah this is gonna be used by anybody
that can be used by Apple and Facebook I

203
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:49,220
guess thanks

204
00:22:49,220 --> 00:23:26,020
user before he was just bpm

205
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:36,620
so yeah we should go do it in a way that
you know we support all the users but if

206
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,840
somebody wants more security than they
should have the option for his

207
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,129
don't like the idea of GDP month for new
users like you know all of us here in

208
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,909
tunis

209
00:23:46,909 --> 00:25:42,500
option to actually I don't think that
high because yeah sorry if the it's the

210
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,289
real side pursue so print out the
closing sign up which can be done to use

211
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,720
for possible for every hour you I feel
about security and usability

212
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,570
question so firstly ability well if I
bring down something and just thought it

213
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:04,110
was safe place I usually forget about
the same place so I put into my possible

214
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:10,270
manager but I'm traveling outside the
regular user so the usability of debt is

215
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,980
probably not been high and also decide
would need to change the process for

216
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,000
example they will need to retire then
probably they have three users with

217
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,690
printed out goals than just gonna do it
so do you somebody over the net

218
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,270
do not sure and the security

219
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:36,320
well it could be kinda ok if that's ok
printed out I really random things are

220
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:44,000
so young and probably also depends on
the threat model probably going to do

221
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,340
this Coryell banker gowns and what you
can do it for you know

222
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:57,270
444 there are still questions like why
not question from Brett so just securing

223
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:04,320
OGR yeah I have shared so you have any
ideas

224
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,939
yeah I had not yet to decide which is
displayed a fingerprint comparison yes I

225
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,549
I think appears so that the user can see
the fingerprint just once or you know 45

226
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:31,490
minutes or something and they can just
compare that they are just as well and

227
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,299
took off the pot assault they are you
know bring all the questions and give

228
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:43,600
him a very closely thank you thank you
have approached pass routes
