1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,620
all statistics from online environments
for us

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:23,390
password resets not something I would
like to have all I hope it's almost

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:35,739
impossible they actually sad I was not
too many times and different countries

4
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:44,919
you trust so in the summer

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:57,219
prospects ex-juror makes presentations

6
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:57,270
currency I want this so

7
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:44,829
industry are solid also got so we have a
little company is possible as ours has

8
00:02:44,829 --> 00:03:24,980
also helped her with her future is
rather low cost about pretty much

9
00:03:24,980 --> 00:05:14,370
everything about it tomorrow so

10
00:05:14,370 --> 00:06:54,569
very well

11
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:13,669
bottle itself as it has less so what it
says will be just like dallas also is

12
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:30,919
let's say they generally shared his
views on the first phase is about that

13
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:48,639
so many Dr Rowland is still in both
cases the getting all the branches of

14
00:07:48,639 --> 00:08:09,240
this week and also I get to see her
stuff here we also get a single groups

15
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:37,919
and so so so it wouldn't be awful so has
total baseball's touts itself

16
00:08:37,919 --> 00:10:20,779
essentially a series or light address
walls so we can run the brakes or so so

17
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:26,000
we get it to her knees

18
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:47,470
which is the last night that he's lying
about that high pressure and makes these

19
00:10:47,470 --> 00:11:25,920
individual policies so the city's they
are so they hired so what I want to

20
00:11:25,920 --> 00:12:04,849
leave a message against his chest on it
so his sleep by now said they'd call

21
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:15,180
myself

22
00:12:15,180 --> 00:13:08,099
730 right or wrong addresses the Apia
7400 whole or in terms of the month so

23
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:29,320
the wiles behavior this high speed high
she was alive so its first loss since

24
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:43,250
the start of a long range of prices who
need us to replace all out it's pretty

25
00:13:43,250 --> 00:14:00,270
much because I want to cut $1 for

26
00:14:00,270 --> 00:17:37,180
always have a chance to help especially
with a high near the mine or so

27
00:17:37,180 --> 00:19:10,659
views so glad we had he has been off
work so just really simple

28
00:19:10,659 --> 00:20:18,720
was essentially run this case how about
the courses for all of us so it's all

29
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:51,890
over the place where I sure hope so

30
00:20:51,890 --> 00:21:09,570
possible but also the color so your
rivals the fields you get a change is

31
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:36,060
these texts uses it so well as use which
is this year she just said the whole way

32
00:21:36,060 --> 00:22:27,290
there is work hookers almost all this
for a fact that the future
