1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,119
000000 000000

2
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:29,948
it seems like crazy but at the same time
there will be a lot of how hello and

3
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:38,680
thank you know one of my across from
becoming the password 12:15

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,129
the people in the room hopefully best
evaluate when talking about giving

5
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:54,059
feedback and promoting trying to make
the cut and sew lights go up I think

6
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,328
I'll go back I really want to
communicate sort of why it should work

7
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,390
and then we can have a little just
change the environment that all the

8
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,400
threat environment for passports

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:23,549
report know anything about it so few
people but a lot of any one thing which

10
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:32,479
is waiting to clear up the environment
is becoming continues to evolve into two

11
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:41,700
companies in the US by the Chinese
original quote but in the end and really

12
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:52,630
you know we look at a time line of the
big fat it's almost like a very and is

13
00:01:52,630 --> 00:02:01,548
only good for the environment that were
in almost like being at the end so

14
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,730
companies are out

15
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:13,260
and what happened and what should you do
about it and what we tried to deal with

16
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,420
that reality has really taken over the
competition but even

17
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:31,779
the color I think it's here it's here
and then the the radius is this the

18
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:53,140
other option but this is killing me but
I think that despite that I still think

19
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,660
that way that is awaiting trip that
would secure an environment where are

20
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,640
you realize you get that many different
ways the one thing that they really have

21
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:18,319
to secure there's all these really
amazing when you come out of having

22
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:34,089
particularly hurt and so this is why I
really change the the model of the cost

23
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,220
the company has become tremendous you
know if your see so your job is on the

24
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,500
line or even the CEO at this point we
seen fire you know like in the target

25
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,040
creature that really material on
companies and people that popular but

26
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,459
they are very and that you're driving
driving like a willingness to try new

27
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,670
things and so they're definitely
opportunity out there are new

28
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,390
technologies new approaches to bring

29
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:18,930
I think this recognition that industry
best practices don't really protect our

30
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:26,550
USERs in the way to be wanting to know
if you look at this sort of thing in the

31
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:35,050
middle here with the first thing we do
is text from my brother server channel

32
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:43,090
and so we're lying but there's so much
that you can search for me it's not just

33
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:50,619
really tired so if you take out the
intercept we've only if there's a paper

34
00:04:50,620 --> 00:05:00,000
that my research put out and talked
about earlier yesterday about Thurs here

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,300
between the type of tactic have an
online account that the only a little

36
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:20,229
bit but you are looking at on the risk
and the blue line right arm players on

37
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:27,310
the on the blood can get disability
right now is also be copy and so the

38
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,060
Fulbright

39
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:40,220
right but what do so in an online yet
taken precautions we seem very

40
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,820
noteworthy news you know where you know
how to make it wasn't that great but if

41
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:55,590
you can't do two things under control
you can limit the ability to try to get

42
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,239
the rear right

43
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:09,050
fairly but in the upper bowl or that
they protected in a while there's

44
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:16,080
nothing stopping their ability to run to
try to correct

45
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:26,128
and so there you know you can disagree
about how far purple flower order to get

46
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:35,180
the ability to collect your arm to
survive and so what we really want that

47
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:50,550
the positivity and the fundamental
perimeter is you cannot kill her but you

48
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:58,930
can get you can get some people 20 did
you know and so the question is how do

49
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:06,250
we make it more easily when widen
packwood no better opportunity when

50
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,930
those windows open up so

51
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:18,470
you know the limit it to you know to be
buried in you know whatever they're

52
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:27,780
doing what we're trying to take the CPU
and i/o the computer resources at your

53
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,719
disposal and using to the maximum
capabilities that ideally the attacker

54
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:40,680
you work hard you work around the same
an ideal doesn't give me happy for

55
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,050
example opportunistic you feel they
can't they can't move to a different

56
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:52,759
architecture and and $50 or jewels
perhaps the right so I certainly had to

57
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,810
deal at all

58
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:03,180
back how are we to get that locking that
we have and you know who might make sure

59
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,889
we're getting enter login and when you
get that response back and certainly

60
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:18,570
pick and so we're trying to get a run in
a call while working in you have this

61
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,210
thing where you have this evening
courses security

62
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:30,299
late separate see how much car into the
equation

63
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,070
senior waiting arms where ultimately
over time more lot will happen at 2:30

64
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,650
in so we're left with the only option
left to push the complexity and you just

65
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:52,170
how hard work but by the guest of the
past and move to get civility over then

66
00:08:52,170 --> 00:09:00,860
maybe we'll get herself at least reset
the password and so now we have the site

67
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,140
over actor who can't protect the fuck
the rest

68
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:14,400
and in the company's vision where they
have to so let's talk about the whole

69
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:22,730
different kind of a different way it did
you hear is something that works to do

70
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:31,470
not try to replace it with something
which is achieving a different kind so

71
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:40,710
we want equal parts right now with the
very much the cost

72
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:55,460
how did that very clearly thought I'd
really love to be able to say that it's

73
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,340
possible even if that data bases even if
there was a sequence action or whatever

74
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:08,960
and not like just the possible but I
know that they were going even though

75
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:17,850
we'd like to be able to prevent somebody
saying what I just want this year and

76
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:28,390
then I don't try and do whatever it was
pretty simple or what you don't want

77
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:35,500
them going by you know every you every
time they were again and yet they can go

78
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,270
to hell

79
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:47,650
one can't you know there was a trend
years ago where people don't really want

80
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,689
it was not really awkward

81
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,900
leave it to the experts and over
Facebook and which I think very rightly

82
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,370
so

83
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,920
hand over the keys to capitol you're
handing over some very very user data

84
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,709
you're subjecting the user to a privacy
breach figure also handed over sort of

85
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:19,460
you never want to say this user created
some yes they are you know you don't

86
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:27,120
want to try somebody else to say this
person was within that you need if

87
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:40,640
you're gonna party they can't make
obviously you know we had years of work

88
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,180
just to get people to do things and it's
good I'm going uphill battle and so

89
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:56,780
anything new at this dinner you know
what's really seen data privacy

90
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:03,130
competitive differentiator so companies
are willing to invest the money to get

91
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,160
that they can see you think it's real
good they can see this technology

92
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,260
provides a real benefit to invest the
money into it and say ok this is a

93
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,970
competitive advantage to protect the
willingness there and I think that you

94
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:25,890
know no one can replace that window you
know the 22nd or whatever it is a very

95
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,600
serious

96
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:38,269
to work with and I think you know the
capital and user experience the history

97
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:45,269
of sort of effort securities all user
and I blame you know I like ecology

98
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,990
where you can bring the service provider
entirely lost password

99
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:57,149
never do it because you didn't do the
service if you can put the onus

100
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:13,199
protect that Patrick Sharp then you know
that the site that you have been a lot

101
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,589
of money trying to get people to pick
these up your support from a decree

102
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:26,569
because you don't have a member of
usability I mean if there's a huge we

103
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:35,130
could potentially be secured and of
course you have to live with a person

104
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,850
see their personal information solely

105
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:50,040
what is quite literally what we're
looking at here is kind of way at car

106
00:13:50,040 --> 00:14:00,389
and so we're gonna do everything else we
get the pic diagrams are you this vendor

107
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:06,540
junior Patrick coming over as he lets
channel get service gonna run they would

108
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:18,930
narrow escape because the key is it has
to be once you produced that minute

109
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,540
which really sucks through it but when
you say

110
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:31,319
you gonna send it to the data port do it
argues that index into clear entity so

111
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,160
literally this this review imagine

112
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,630
headed by random generation to you today
than ever before in the block is that

113
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:52,029
grow and imagine you know you take a
look at these security number generator

114
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,959
you fill it with trend data

115
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:13,109
basically you decide what you have to
and the server can use that for smart so

116
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:28,810
it's 64 bytes out there that and then
you say about it so I look at you and

117
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,849
empowered

118
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:38,350
table and that's ok these values are not
you can't get from a point of view like

119
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,720
you normally would

120
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,920
when you do the first half getting each
one you send that over and if it gets to

121
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:56,069
the Royal use the way to extract decide
which location paltry from collecting

122
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:05,529
but the bottom has that there's a night
which was uniquely identify either for

123
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,810
the user and what that would you do

124
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,489
that's another city by train them well
for this I D

125
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:24,730
than a private number right side but
aside from that that this week is the

126
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:34,700
data for that so even though I only have
one that data in it when when using a

127
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:43,709
coupon that if we throw away that key
that that process because that there is

128
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:57,899
no longer you can no longer get the salt
2010 this gives you an ability so what

129
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:06,550
does this too so we have to erase data
and we get to come together and

130
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:14,260
contributes to the Very Large Array Dana
mom we want to kill virtually all the

131
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,720
right things still a little bit of the
data and cracked pepper right back where

132
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:28,940
we started but it turned out that you
use that you were looking beautiful

133
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,450
every time you get over it and you are
going to be looking at a uniformly

134
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,860
distributed random location in the table
lookup is gonna be the missing that they

135
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,699
have to deal directly with that you're
going to point to a

136
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:48,250
don't increases and so you can imagine
it when you make one look up

137
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:55,770
great but they're gonna have to date if
you to our place and subsequent purchase

138
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:01,160
an exponentially decreasing

139
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:13,320
described and you you know just look up
we get to the station where he won a 100

140
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,929
million work because they want to know
which he writes that we live in a world

141
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:35,390
where I can think that's right until the
date that the Interfax powerful and that

142
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,680
is a very different fire you know you
can kiss I sit down together and build

143
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:48,540
huge network of every sites $10 million
site you know we can cut some numbers

144
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:58,780
start till kiss and make up on you know
its history

145
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:07,110
tell you whatever the server is it meant
that the service went to rate it would

146
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,879
get and use it as the first objection
here I can't risk dropping that because

147
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,630
i dont read your recent Apple gets
corrupted so you think you can basically

148
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:36,680
keep a copy of the public good about our
talk but it's important not encrypt you

149
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,610
don't want it just essentially be
stretching so you do like it are you

150
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:52,699
keep that you keep the public on this
paper in a few ever need to get back to

151
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:00,100
bring you bring that by you can read and
so this this enables the ability to

152
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,639
scale back the park which gives you sort
of protection who wants to get locked

153
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,670
into the server but all the ability once
you can when you can recovery you can

154
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:16,100
now upgrade your house in reply and so
you can fill the system between between

155
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:25,260
the public and private buildings locked
up system where either side reach you

156
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,790
can recover from recycled and it's like
drinking get back you can she get back

157
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:40,928
on the court and get back to the state
where you know the pattern somebody come

158
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:48,360
up is for example ok this data pool
which we built this actually running use

159
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,510
the API function

160
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,790
we've got a bunch of sites they're
running live in production today but

161
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,500
obviously you know you could read and
you know every three to five years

162
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,510
doubling or tripling the size the table
senior

163
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,490
you know that you're headed back to the
end of it

164
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:20,760
dinner here and then you just need to
know when and how and you can easily get

165
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,370
back to that you wanted

166
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,870
regenerate generation of Block

167
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,610
but that would require people to skip
ahead so that more interaction with the

168
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:46,639
site and one last thing I talked about
is you know we've heard a lot about

169
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:56,320
using encryption and was a great talk he
talked about the Cablegate

170
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,730
they put the ciphertext

171
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,160
in 2010 or something and the 2011

172
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,880
power cord and there was no sense but in
the end it was useless because one that

173
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,040
absolutely

174
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:22,080
and so the notion that once the steps
that they're gone forever and and and

175
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,559
and the other interesting thing is I
just want to get this kind of fun game

176
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:35,660
so if you're using the command-line

177
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:44,140
how many rounds what does anybody know
if you want to get you know I'm here and

178
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:54,890
that was it only rare series so far this
is 216 generations shot one ok so this

179
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:11,350
is you know me to change this

180
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,139
ok so you know this is like easy to
crack paper right let's just do a couple

181
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:25,650
were so as I write this is your this is
the case you get you into the server and

182
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:36,360
one round and we have a winner and one
in every five to protect your SST up

183
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,020
until the through the end of 2013 and
even now that the change the plan on

184
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,720
using

185
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:56,549
yeah the number but you know it's an
improvement their standard shipping my

186
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:08,400
system it any wonder how many iterations
but she went sixty and there was another

187
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:17,870
one we're going to get out of debt that
something years to partition 65 this was

188
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:26,110
not too terrible to the 16 shots so I
mean when you encrypt with even the best

189
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:48,780
practice cool to come and check it out
here every so if you if you run by

190
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:54,460
gnashing step into the process right now

191
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,580
option of say although it will require

192
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:07,189
is revocable I can go to the services
they destroyed when you try to get my

193
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:16,289
password when you try it yet he did you
might see me and commute to the nation

194
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:22,620
she can start doing things in Christian
that still user

195
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,559
mostly unexplored territory like an
online network

196
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:35,370
yes they give users more control so
there you go

197
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:43,559
so imagine what the world without

198
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:56,370
I mean if we can truly had reached the
upcoming album right that's why they do

199
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:09,600
it make money but you know you can
eliminate the financial and potentially

200
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,059
limiting the feasibility of you can get
you get your head around how difficult

201
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:23,440
it might take what it looks like we're
the only thing that's quite passionately

202
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:44,350
how do you plan to access it and how do
you stay so yeah you know right now we

203
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,879
have located in Dallas and you have to
copy data of course of $0.16 per bike

204
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:59,509
ride you need redundancy within iraq has
a lot of people are you know

205
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:03,909
generate the day that make sure that you
can verify the integrity of the data you

206
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,340
want to know if a player that the data
as some sort of figured in the curve

207
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:14,320
because obviously if there is a change
thx something called the application

208
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:23,529
level but the property is eager to make
ourselves more and see you get this

209
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:29,570
you know where security sort of
increases or decreases

210
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:37,620
where security or so it's it's it's a
it's a really interesting

211
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:49,678
16 terabyte hard disk or $100 per second
that you find out

212
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:57,129
try but it's also it's just really open
up the possibility

213
00:27:57,129 --> 00:28:09,428
use not but actual you know so I i feel
like there's maybe something I'm not

214
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:17,419
getting your but I'm asset size and the
cost of these terabyte erase it kind of

215
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,879
does this feel sort of like you using
them like a one bad except they're not

216
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:30,389
using someone in so to me it just seems
like you take something like an HSM and

217
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:32,820
use it to generate the

218
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,840
to use the you know he'd take the the
the ross also

219
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,559
process through nature salmon come up
with the secret so to use that it

220
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,720
effectively is it asked the same
question is what's your you know what

221
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:55,000
your trust level and that hardware and
what year so I think that using data at

222
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,520
the dimension of our security was wasn't
it and they lost the key and all those

223
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:09,260
devices were likely compromise and so
there's something about having I think

224
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:17,320
that changed this is gonna be it takes
for example you know what to do when you

225
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,220
look at the network say well I want work
out extra per site per second that I

226
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:32,250
would ever buy that bike so well at the
library

227
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:38,980
gonna take the 805 the network it just
changes the at window so visible in

228
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:47,159
Egypt Samsung still go if there's a
vulnerability and I will be thinking

229
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,159
maybe start out with the single have to
you know will give you time to react and

230
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,029
it became the chief
