1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,810
good evening everyone maybe then you'll
want the job done and they were like to

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,120
clarify one thing immediately there is a
reason why this presentation has been

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,379
interested in the closing the reason is
the following the president going to

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,400
present yo what their fashion is a
traitor to the point that you will not

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,869
be able to follow all the other
presentation we do things now that we

6
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:33,890
are ready and the danger weather and so
we can start first things first in 1916

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,890
don't worry I remind that I will be
brief I will cover fifty years and just

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:46,039
use lifestyles me early 1960's means
their friend and the Corbett or helping

9
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,300
deployed to face no computer password
the situation was a swallow everyone at

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,120
MIT sharing the same in free and one
share these five so there were true

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,438
problem to solve a way to outright the
softer to read only the death of a

12
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,429
specific user and the way to keep people
from using too much the mainframe likely

13
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,030
have to pick the precondition have a
completely change it so the question is

14
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:23,040
why haven't login protocol solve it
let's take a closer look at the basic

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,030
Logan flow process so simple that no one
ever to improve it until now

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:38,009
Morales this is the plows simply 5 that
each looking follows matter of stronger

17
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,590
positive no matter how many paths for
the last check which again is always the

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,810
same if the past communicate about a
user corresponds to the köppen said

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:54,759
that he be dangerous aftermath allow
reading and doing something now I have

20
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:02,100
nothing personal against the silent
Querrey in fact I love MySQL but I think

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,679
that I did find it is a legacy and that
in a world where heroin carries a lot of

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,920
Dubai's with them

23
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,670
and is well connected to the Internet it
makes no sense to say our information in

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,458
so many remote databases and then use it
so many strong and hopefully different

25
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:28,270
paths are only to authorized access to
them while most of you folks is to

26
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,940
improve our depending on the rules to
weaken what happens before or after

27
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,359
these Querrey we create a login flow
without his weary and without a possible

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,890
if I stop let's say which objective we
said we believe that only you should

29
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,130
possession of your data that you're
smart for should be the guardian of your

30
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,120
privacy and that were once reduced must
ask for permission directly from you

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,220
keeping faith with this principle we
created the flow where that is not

32
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,170
stored in a remote service but on your
smartphone subsequently we make possible

33
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,208
a diary remote read that as though
you're sorry we didn't need to trust him

34
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:19,100
to the party this change which ones see
like a simple exercises style to someone

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,720
overly concerned about privacy he stared
solves all the problems that revolve

36
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:31,600
around sign up login and registration
and we did that in only three steps that

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,930
one user experience as fellow Jews and
other day that allow name surname

38
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,470
Briscoe around addresses and so on

39
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:49,510
place they know I'm talk about that and
not possible user will never ever to see

40
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,160
a password again when the user is that
they are a sign of the shot his name of

41
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,959
a charge that we call single lady what
happens in the back and together with a

42
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,100
single lady user devices are also signed
an encryption key by yourself this

43
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,310
encryption key is not stored on the
user's device but everytime astounded on

44
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,289
our services the key back to it that is
only stored luckily

45
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:23,300
a/s so we have the key and user has that
and this mean that even in the case of

46
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,150
data breaches

47
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,698
RDB the user data will continue to be
safe in the user pocket whether wants to

48
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,220
read that are directly from the user
device master and a dialogue in which in

49
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,060
part on the login page technology on a
frame in with PHP and re-ask that must

50
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,470
be seized and you can do that with a
simple yet cloned from UDUB I like a lot

51
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,250
of Barton's looking which pays with me
during this battle dress panties and

52
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,360
receive data directly from the user's
mark for the processes kick it off when

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,110
user clicks on his part and enter sees a
digit single lady and is what happens

54
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,289
the back and the PHP creates a run them
to trust sorry that we can you da dee as

55
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:15,960
for unique transaction ID then the PHP
does a particle with see URL to our

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,469
servers we do some form of checks and
that we forward received that together

57
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,800
with a push notification to the
corresponding device have to deposit

58
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,250
call iframe refresh itself Irish second
looking for a file colored like the you

59
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:38,500
da tavola fire that for now is
nonexistent final snap front and bush's

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,630
vacation will work up there and I yes no
question will be displayed with the data

61
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,830
that has been forwarded to the device to
use website as well as your personal

62
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:54,270
that would you like to send it now if
the user clicks yes Apple you apart call

63
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:01,460
to the target URL on residences with
that as the inside and the UDID plays

64
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,080
know that no you that I would be
transmitted or salaries and no user data

65
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,740
has lower than ourselves so knowing the
UDID cannot permit or an acre insiders

66
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:20,380
to looking we did that over another pass
final stab the data from the user device

67
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,860
will be still rather than addressing are
a full name and like the Utd viola like

68
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,110
others say that refreshes itself can now
read the data sent from another browser

69
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,210
devices session

70
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,620
Utd could be compared it to the session
a day

71
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,669
that usually just origine cokie after
the passer verify step but this time

72
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:49,570
he's saying is to combine Julia Frances
russia may be from different advisors or

73
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,719
IP addresses it doesn't matter

74
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:59,710
doing so we re Duchess to the data save
it on the user's device let everything

75
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,590
with a skein the residency stan is
anyone when by the login with either

76
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,840
barked on when the user input is a
tricycle in his box on the iframe we

77
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,849
create around the Utd and we kindly ask
to our server to forward to the

78
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,220
corresponding device ourselves than
create a push notification which it

79
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:27,789
together with the UDID to the user
device if the user except he's that are

80
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,090
stored inside a parley have sent
directly from the user device to the

81
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,739
responses while hunting yesterday the
pastor verify step represented the

82
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,520
alteration mechanism for allowing the
reading of data released over it

83
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,919
presidencies we address format that mac
and cheese into a simple yes-no question

84
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:59,150
now that organization is implied by the
user sending is identification in

85
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,560
response to that yes or no question

86
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,900
sign up or login are indeed one and the
same thing they have been murdered into

87
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,849
a single step

88
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:19,610
this is a sign up experience are the
dogs banned websites without a single

89
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:30,740
lady if you want to buy a ticket on our
side need to do a sign up faced and

90
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:44,060
disease process so boring so
time-consuming so tedious soyuz less

91
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:53,540
you will need at least two millions of
innocent 200 asked to complete this is

92
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,740
so boring that we need to skip to go
forward because it's too much boring

93
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:08,600
differently you need to meanness take on
mobile is that this is the same process

94
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,170
wait a single lady but you will put your
single lady

95
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:21,219
single lady but you will receive a
portion of a gauge on your smartphone

96
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:29,150
and a yes-no question will be displayed
and if the user clicks yes the data will

97
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:36,520
send back to the website directly and a
little bit of javascript with AK open

98
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:46,370
all the time to drive fields and you
will end fifty seconds instead the

99
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,510
advantages of that solution are evident
and i want to sale I just a few

100
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,589
decentralized clarity password Lance not
even a single mother passed away no more

101
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,050
data breaches because websites cannot
delete sensitive data update customers

102
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:08,359
at the end of the session consequently
we are completely thorough knowledge our

103
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,950
service do not know your own stealing an
encrypted way user data and our solution

104
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,930
is as close as possible to the 25
features that a patent application

105
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,089
scheme should according to the quest to
replace possible without solution a user

106
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:30,740
must indeed never create memories to see
or type a password again we all know

107
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,600
that many companies are trying to make a
login possible ads Yahoo which had

108
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,240
talked as mass media mines which are
troubling anime that seems to me not

109
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,459
very confident how modern our slogan we
register for now but I'll solution is

110
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:52,469
the only one that offers low-key in with
none of that onboarding simply by moving

111
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,170
data storage from Sarah remote service
to the device in our pocket

112
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,029
we have solved all the usability
problems that are discussing lenience

113
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:08,510
like this result is that like today
where if you are a rolling one on the

114
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,760
west side you have to ride one hundredth
time your doctor and your master

115
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,959
hopefully one of the different password
with single lady the one other web sites

116
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:25,369
will each team asked you for a reduction
so your dad the trick is simply doesn't

117
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,070
realize director and give a full redux
as to whether replicate each time this

118
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:38,440
week by the way he's now RUSI patent the
app is already done for almost any

119
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,250
platform and asked me that I'm afraid
for BlackBerry user happy I already the

120
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:52,959
code of the login button is available on
guitar beanies facilities now that we

121
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,649
have built a brother we need
distribution try it for yourself

122
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:09,640
play around with a spread the word

123
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:58,210
you know if you know who is there so
there's some validity and I rate this

124
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:06,680
story

125
00:13:06,680 --> 00:14:05,630
because while we watch what you sow

126
00:14:05,630 --> 00:15:29,440
you know you know you know which we are
you so by the unexposed recover

127
00:15:29,440 --> 00:16:06,070
a lot of what goes on in your they made
that but maybe they made it very clear

128
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:39,400
that those who comes to protect using
that I believe you to say this is how

129
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:56,720
much as it is for you

130
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:09,400
jets attacked at all if I want to get a
disease that's quite sensibly if I

131
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:26,980
wanted to say something like that
happens you the dissenting all the

132
00:17:26,980 --> 00:18:37,790
yet to watch what you say or do you like
let's go back to the city and its

133
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:49,129
associated that the show so required
link text

134
00:18:49,130 --> 00:19:11,520
2012 she'd start next to you

135
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:37,010
well
