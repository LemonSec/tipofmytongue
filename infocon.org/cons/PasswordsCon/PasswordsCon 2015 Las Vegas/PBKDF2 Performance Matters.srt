1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,119
so to its talk to complain I wanna rock
era of our lake where most of them to

2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:01:05,908
find a crafty one direction which ones
with the four they will like I welcome

3
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:19,369
it comes with a historic black man I
think the various and describe it

4
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:32,829
don't really tell what is important to
say we thought I'm gonna give you quick

5
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:45,798
instructions to this may be way below
what people need to understand how ya

6
00:01:45,799 --> 00:02:10,489
been quite what I meant as a direct
result and then I'm gonna cut but she's

7
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,120
a peaceful

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:29,489
River great pussy under construction

9
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:41,489
this function and you should reading
your book the ticket size and then at

10
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:49,230
the end you get the result this is a
kind patient does this do to make sure

11
00:02:49,230 --> 00:03:08,450
he's going to be very next pitch and you
may think it looks like it's

12
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:21,418
understand this then that's great so he
looks right and you have stopped

13
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:32,349
separately you have to you he will
another if you have to do it manually

14
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,379
got

15
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:51,750
indicated to this is this is a matrix
promise right here at the idea that you

16
00:03:51,750 --> 00:04:08,329
can swap in different PRS in practice it
seemed like something but crazy

17
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:38,730
scene for some reason so yeah and you
can choose to make it take time and time

18
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:51,890
again so this is the means when you come
up with some kind of but this say

19
00:04:51,890 --> 00:05:02,960
fifteen seconds and then you work out
how to choose this time and the problem

20
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:13,489
is if you opt to you are using these say
that it could then you're keeping a

21
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:22,330
sports ten times advantage to attack
what about later GPUs or target and

22
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:31,630
power and general energy and its so that
the main thing that defendants

23
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:53,150
work all the work of my lights behind
the scenes where it's true we take like

24
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:12,450
the first people to this capability to
Pittsburgh so you have to let this bring

25
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:21,800
you the soul and then you saw the
signature gatherer

26
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:35,500
see that has very strong dates so you
can use that to do every level in

27
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:46,680
sequence so if a tree house will buy
your attacker well yeah so much the

28
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,409
outbreak this all these slides were 100%
out until someone you like a pretty good

29
00:06:54,409 --> 00:07:15,090
said general election the previous
diagram to the end or the question is

30
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,469
how many compression function
applications direction well

31
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:35,029
1234 and this is what is 12 people this
PO Box is excellent but the stunt this

32
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:50,449
is funded by two there is a long time
that would otherwise tells people that

33
00:07:50,449 --> 00:08:09,539
this problem is that these two dates and
their school due to thirst for the

34
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:18,990
patient and then 33 so this is

35
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:29,200
not so great this is this is nine by
lots of people especially known about by

36
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:39,620
people like those of GPA's think about
what he did right defend the two nations

37
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:56,410
which is the people here so to put two
eyes light switch in this context and

38
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:09,650
implementations are very interesting
things on this slide

39
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:19,540
SQL scripts scripts and despite my
people know it has a post-processing

40
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:32,020
step directions what it doesn't change
in any way we can

41
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:45,720
shouldn't take theirs as well thank all
the rest who this one's just simply

42
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:59,840
because it's freedom so the winner is
mr. ACL jobs

43
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,040
and they win because i three being tired
but its trio the library and they got it

44
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:19,240
right from the very first so that's what
happens he have you written by guests

45
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:31,970
other people open cell core so these are
basically this 6 share that same by a

46
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:41,220
German then caught and imprisoned Hinds
and he noticed this 2013 time and they

47
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:52,860
killed by Django did the same thing but
in a complex so this CD with the service

48
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:02,050
so what is your lock step with he said

49
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:27,800
reprocessed very long keys and that if
you send Django and this will take time

50
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:39,250
and then well and I cannot say with who
has always been like this where a fixed

51
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:49,600
yet so the rest just yeah it's like

52
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,839
free PSD is particularly interesting is
that description but what did they

53
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:07,639
measure one time how quickly things go
and then just place your immediate way

54
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,769
any

55
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:29,610
well just give away to identity or so
this this i mean this demonstrates that

56
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:40,420
these incidents problem maybe I don't
know he caught 11 aerospace incompetent

57
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,449
I don't think that that's lies so don't
like doing this because they've done

58
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:56,430
exactly what the sunset and yeah the
next question is how much difference

59
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:04,029
does a two-time advantage does it get
lots of noise is it covered over by

60
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:12,100
inefficiency by fellow Briton function
in patients and stuff so well

61
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,209
measure it

62
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:33,779
this action-packed so so and for saying
that it takes and then that slow on that

63
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:41,360
and then there's too much maybe like so
much

64
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,389
which will be fun and they did not go
well

65
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:57,220
concerning but it's certainly much
quicker so like in my brain so

66
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:13,279
my speech first and that's basically
yeah so if you must but I saw your wife

67
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,730
maybe this light line during that way
it's kinda 12 seconds on this particular

68
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:33,540
machine that many variations but result
from PHP 5 why is that way that kind of

69
00:14:33,540 --> 00:15:09,250
their home on that means it has taken
three states away and that's why they

70
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:22,139
see this type and area but CBCP time but
on the bright there to see that but

71
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,250
let's talk to me

72
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:36,519
impression on the left is like this is
questioned functions and everything else

73
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:47,600
and so like memory allocation why they
do a member of the free human medication

74
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,250
and it's free so they clean everything
out and they need to be the same thing

75
00:15:51,250 --> 00:16:05,130
it's really great so yeah they they they
spend time not doing it

76
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:22,830
so I wouldn't talk about long and it's
broken his friends do this because they

77
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:34,370
want but I suspect is done because they
can probably guess from the sale if they

78
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,100
know they can say well the interesting
thing I wanted his in the second gonna

79
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,710
generate that right

80
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:55,950
generate the rest you can include things
onto the site you can have a step where

81
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:07,240
you spend time 11 and then you can have
a step but you don't need it but the

82
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:15,480
books if you if you do and you kind of
crazy and may be deployed system which

83
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:31,720
is dependent on this work then this
library hours this week and so have a

84
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,660
graph

85
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:51,460
self 24 2013 file photo thing on the
last night and then people and then

86
00:17:51,460 --> 00:18:00,850
saying things they say the state and
then that's it it's not too cool machine

87
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:12,620
so you can see that between 12 blocks
the top notch full-time the CPU time as

88
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:24,790
well and you can also see that the
slightly less so it's able to kind eyes

89
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:34,520
but not completely some elected so
quickly because if you if you are using

90
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:44,200
this sorry for bucks in there might be
say 10 hugs between what you achieve if

91
00:18:44,200 --> 00:19:04,330
you were into it I think these things
very very very well designed is probably

92
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,850
would have i mean some of them some
design changes that you could consider

93
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:20,199
it were true in various groups say
yousef

94
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:28,410
stuff but it's described very they could
have made a real job of saying well you

95
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:35,070
do this just thought he and then save
the result and then use that as a start

96
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,750
on it we saw action that would have been

97
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:47,570
relations white power in power because
my day job is

98
00:19:47,570 --> 00:20:02,490
mobile if you paid and power and you're
developing outs then your users and 1

99
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:38,260
and you said that you weren't any
actions but yes

100
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:49,400
cover so the whole is designed in a way
it is

101
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:57,940
Tripoli and that means that things like
X soaring to get the media with gcc get

102
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:17,770
a chance to compile to expose the very
quick and that everything is a complex

103
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:26,620
new optimized without open optimization
which is a disaster is it working I

104
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:36,469
would say is done I'm not playing well I
think he's a punk record but there's

105
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:54,100
still some space and the main well using
unchanged means there's some say the

106
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:04,399
function in once things in network and
you want to try and say

107
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:24,750
it's not necessary but I also don't want
to maintain similar functions so yes we

108
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,789
like and just not doing too many
questions

109
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:43,549
yeah yeah yeah ok one quick one

110
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:52,980
are you aware or have you tested how any
of the stuff works and joy are just 48

111
00:22:52,980 --> 00:23:03,690
that just happens to be where I am
facing a bottleneck yeah I'm too so I

112
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:21,140
think but this is quick but I'm going to
his son so I did look back and wait wait

113
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:42,059
I slowed down some passion which is also
say so we we we sell to fight that works

114
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:55,710
reasonably quickly but you may question
what happened to this on to my own

115
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,330
expected results
