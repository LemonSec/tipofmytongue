1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
competition they left off

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:34,329
breakout just like her said I believe so
it looks better wage workers the kinds

3
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,800
of things that are not in their new
house actually go how to deal with here

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,930
to come up with a new thing that I do or
that there is a skill that I think they

5
00:00:46,930 --> 00:01:02,109
should they should do and so every year
this year so so that is I actually do

6
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,140
recovery

7
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:14,060
well I talked about today is a single
comedy old man's

8
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:23,790
so 9725

9
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:32,090
what would you do if you got a crack
next week what would you do how often

10
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:40,000
asked how we were getting out twice last
last

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,630
explored

12
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:59,610
enterprises theoretically there's no so
I just kind of woman

13
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:12,410
you know that's what I that's what I do
for a living and so but as you start you

14
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:26,740
got the exact same dog every week we're
so they have a ninety-day 100% so what

15
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:45,459
you're going to do so much is the same
words the same 832 apologies

16
00:02:45,459 --> 00:03:03,230
you know we also do a complete air
carriers have 48 hours to use is granted

17
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:14,810
so we were talking so how do we

18
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:26,630
this is gonna be a little baby here kind
of here with me so how do we do it we

19
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:37,390
obtain that we should really get the
hatches as well as we did you remove

20
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:45,970
that once we've already cuz I do too

21
00:03:45,970 --> 00:04:00,570
art rid of so many ways while it's going
on you actually take to get a new bill

22
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:10,250
just standard that is just like you used
to like her access to know what I would

23
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,149
do everything that's in there every
Prime membership every change your

24
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:31,729
password every house for the last time
you put those tracks back and pulled out

25
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:46,560
these things like this is just like
starter user and password

26
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,770
walls and others another slate and it
tells you what's the most common

27
00:04:52,770 --> 00:05:10,229
password how many users have it on that
enable her to stay so you can see the

28
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:18,820
job now anything you want that so just
like this

29
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:27,688
ok so you know this is you know we're
trying to protect

30
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,179
and select

31
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:42,508
risk you're for sure that that's just
you know what that's not the right is

32
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:55,059
literally certain extra exclamation
point there's not a theoretical risk

33
00:05:55,059 --> 00:06:14,249
that is a regional so we know this post
so disliked metrics yeah you know what

34
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:31,959
demands track because you know I get an
extra 100 and so like other words a

35
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:43,679
money money for security products
companies and just six thanks they need

36
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:52,539
a way to attract even approve it back in
so we're able to generate that on a

37
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,860
weekly basis

38
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:06,209
long-term just not necessary for the
whole point it is literally to say how

39
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:11,249
many farmers home made up

40
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:18,909
risks but it's how many higher risk than
300 or 400 this month and that's a bad

41
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:25,729
guy race it's just a number

42
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:34,279
tool to find out their improvement is
well you know this is a real you know

43
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,069
hardly any user not arbitrary

44
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:59,599
that's why I just have the same here
anymore you know you know i three months

45
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:10,349
later ones do it again by the way a
difference to actually prove pattern

46
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,960
from last week you know but it's
literally like know he had to certain

47
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:26,969
users and we fix its own literally is to
actually based on this is why I didn't

48
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:38,500
save jobs and still only in cash so get
out of this is an actual risk you'll

49
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,990
find as just one the questions you know
which accounts the regular when they

50
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,459
were both counts

51
00:08:50,459 --> 00:09:03,609
surely do that you know to look
constantly all help desk has helped us

52
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,920
you know which

53
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:17,189
I gotta change my password to my dad and
I can change my password changes that

54
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,300
I'm going to last well passwords

55
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:32,519
all times because administrator is a
policy you know they're going that I

56
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:47,329
gotta do so but they also get over there
is no way to tell how do you like how he

57
00:09:47,329 --> 00:10:03,649
really manage your what did you do it
you know you know they've been beyond

58
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:17,980
really gonna tell you what they said ok
we'll look at what's what's really just

59
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:27,190
an introduction for always with me
always hard on this is why it is say it

60
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:35,370
is really ok it's not theoretical this
is not paid off this rocky this is a

61
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:49,839
real winner ok so the numbers out of his
change something else it's not like the

62
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,570
very first time for the democrats

63
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:05,910
that's not relevant to you know how to
read a number of things so totally not

64
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:15,350
what happens every week so this is six
months thirty reached down ok so you can

65
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:23,440
see there told counts too slowly
rotating around you don't just just

66
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:39,050
never hear it somewhere so 5504 to save
battery and obviously a member of the

67
00:11:39,050 --> 00:12:01,650
land around this probably hundreds of
the time they want to make one week at

68
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:08,280
all of a sudden the amount of cracks
operate thousands down for hours

69
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:21,650
ok so I you know we saw the status quo
you know something bad well to say that

70
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:35,709
there is ok and they have you know so
all of a sudden this week right here so

71
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:48,220
what happened this week they just simply
change the past so now

72
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:55,180
2004 risks are they to minimize the
risks

73
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,489
now they've made their passwords

74
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:12,260
you can see you know it's floating
around 3.0 3435

75
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:23,560
you know there this is where I was
hoping to see out you get this data

76
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:32,800
report you do things I say yes what you
are tips for how to change it actually

77
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,819
been to places were once every three
months for the administrators they had

78
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:57,770
an incredibly effective way because
she's gonna come back for a while so are

79
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:13,020
the percentages 89 so once again what
happened here so we know the map at the

80
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:29,150
crash well immediately and then are so
we've gotten that users to grow and you

81
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:43,110
sir so slightly the length of her
growing CA 92019 care

82
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:57,940
providing the service and I want to see
a lot of Wellsburg set aside so so over

83
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,930
time to talk about matters that I can
see pics but there's other things going

84
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:14,120
on are the most popular past like
actually gone and sanitized so this is

85
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,990
the most this particular place you know
in this case Old Spice people of

86
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:34,120
approximately 9,000 jews this company
owned by 12 30 so you can see that one

87
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:51,209
week that he said oh sure a lot of over
200 reached a shot that down here that

88
00:15:51,209 --> 00:16:01,750
is good battery someone did something
here someone should be like that and you

89
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:16,230
can see the issue most popular ones in
this whole other difference so we've

90
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:24,810
gone through that right so that's one
too many mistakes and I'm gonna last so

91
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,119
older house from their secondary no
mandates lot smaller cities can see how

92
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,370
it's managed to save 300 and 400 same
thing

93
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:43,030
ok now is this your domain so I don't
have any

94
00:16:43,030 --> 00:17:14,180
week now you can see the occasion at a
certain time now maybe this is a

95
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:23,190
three-month window me this password
change with this domain has done

96
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:36,450
anything to pack Indian crew or silicate
know this is the amount of disabled cash

97
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:47,780
but you can see how things to do in
about that enables this place in the

98
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,270
house

99
00:17:49,270 --> 00:18:00,470
roughly 200 increases a little bit so
overall percentages here we go to this

100
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,560
other domain look at their heirs were
talking prior so it stays there so it's

101
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,389
not like some random Luke his literacy
what's the Maranello a terrorist hello

102
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:23,870
special budget deficits and ban users
use it so bad out in the second location

103
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,080
is the most common passwords this one in
particular whatever is one and it

104
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,999
dropped off a senior ok what you can

105
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:51,789
then it disappears so these are bad idea
was to me that this was a another

106
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,619
division of things there is there are
things to track their you can actually

107
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:05,399
use as a free number account for roughly
2500 ANSI and slowly increases over the

108
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,518
st. Louis County goes down his back

109
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:18,589
large accounts that say they won't count
flows around 1,400 take the amount of

110
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:28,708
disabled hey so we had a trophy 1200 and
the town so this domain did go through

111
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:38,669
the office able to counter this is let's
just change the past you know some of us

112
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:44,549
went around and then you can see and
slowly increase the more casual get into

113
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:54,889
sable but not having the past six counts
of the enable accounts you can see that

114
00:19:54,889 --> 00:20:03,069
they fluctuated most drastic improvement
where we have not been able to pass the

115
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:10,529
percentages of 89 10 11 2008 did have a
nice interesting ball where the

116
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:23,889
percentages and not actually less is not
back down how long is trying to echo

117
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,079
receive a character housewares and this
is week by week by week by week for

118
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:40,020
three months is going up and then 10 11
12 hours you know there's

119
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:53,750
staff is the most common passion so much
to this the same things we want our

120
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:04,870
users and it slowly decreasing using his
individual house where it shows shows

121
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:12,260
every week this

122
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:25,030
ok and you can see the actual risk
actually officially I'd like to see

123
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:38,310
these all their 2009 you can do things
like to actually it's just presenting I

124
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,220
have access to unique set of data that
you're cracking the same thing we

125
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:57,100
progress progress is these domains or
whatever or twice a week have the

126
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:16,929
industry 242 main stairs Special K and
surely no one there have been changes

127
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:28,390
here and there are children and children
and test also this as those are fish you

128
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:35,390
wrap it shows our risk is getting
smaller and smaller and smaller so

129
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:42,810
that's literally and I just kind of
wanted to show that you know what i mean

130
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,770
this is all

131
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:53,960
so for a situation you know all the data
so that you can just do whatever

132
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:04,330
question actually drops strategies used
to do it is literally almost all the

133
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,050
time

134
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:11,070
peter is also a little can do increase
the length tonight training training

135
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:18,220
training another bar talk about what i
mean you know they told us they say here

136
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,120
who ran the past four years

137
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:38,229
cities with a true one live show their
script and guess what they're putting

138
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:53,830
your top 10 top 10 that that's what I'm
saying to the organization

139
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,000
what we're seeing is that just keep
doing that that's exactly what this is

140
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:45,720
every week they get their tops the list
of users go slap these users

141
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:58,890
the question was over all the reasons
why is he let you know and I can

142
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:07,370
character and tell me about so yes if
