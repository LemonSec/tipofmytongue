1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:09,590
have occurred over fishing with it and
that's it I'm super sorry we're in a

2
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:25,780
very special and expect this obviously
great but what about Oracle server that

3
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:41,909
that's a really good question and some
sites every day you see it's not ready

4
00:01:41,909 --> 00:02:13,040
but just so you know it's weird

5
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,108
yes

6
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:48,739
tricks but are you might say you know
here's a review it and take you through

7
00:02:48,739 --> 00:03:26,909
2006 much needed some word the radio
station here to cater to their well

8
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:34,728
water detector

9
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:48,459
things like be like her so don't go and
it's great for large-scale

10
00:03:48,459 --> 00:04:11,329
equal rights as well as a difference or
search targeted sites like this press

11
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,769
release

12
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:26,290
markers on time and essentially this is
only a test the service

13
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:42,510
and we take that could only get 20 years
ago we are certain you had two separate

14
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:51,099
occasions but we did not report the
haitians

15
00:04:51,100 --> 00:05:17,860
Korea security or was that website
whenever defects

16
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:33,050
takes actually excited and grateful for
the work while you're there and then

17
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:50,040
when it works towards internet on your
way to your most recent search your

18
00:05:50,040 --> 00:06:18,480
Gmail I think we're just not a good
chance to use it some other major site

19
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:42,560
about your air force and the person
really how'd you do that you have

20
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:59,510
texting on it that way less than what we
haven't seen each other down low

21
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:14,070
things like security or if you don't you
don't actually treat

22
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:48,390
just lets users security and also
service reports that protect your basic

23
00:07:48,390 --> 00:08:13,599
dance with a certain person and work in
Figure eight

24
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:28,520
such as we were also listen

25
00:08:28,520 --> 00:09:03,490
rockets or whatever she can take action
right away and that's not true and it

26
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:54,170
also works basic weighted sum things up
a bit in this case reports about using

27
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:25,939
your and are you ever say what I sleep
or other agents would expect

28
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,400
what's this

29
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:51,750
it's nice that are running through but
it's a little isolated

30
00:10:51,750 --> 00:11:25,500
like that it's just not this extreme
live next year so I'm ready let's go

31
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,870
ahead and generate

32
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:45,850
spoke is something like that so the
person to discard

33
00:11:45,850 --> 00:12:38,000
sure-fire way frankly permit her to send
out there is some way or if you're fired

34
00:12:38,000 --> 00:13:14,980
what is your street because that's what
it's about what and what's known as the

35
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:44,470
check and another five or six which are
trying to steal your money to steal your

36
00:13:44,470 --> 00:14:13,760
sensitive to touch the water and of
course you're generating and you need to

37
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,160
certainly not arrested

38
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:29,069
368 sure dude

39
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:52,180
store to me that's not what happened to
this which equates to over 20,000 year

40
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:22,270
3464 it looks like it so obvious
security work there were some weird to

41
00:15:22,270 --> 00:16:17,829
rate so it's like this and this and that
was pretty you're in that way it's

42
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:39,960
working well despite warning there in
the dog which is this report was taken

43
00:16:39,960 --> 00:17:08,050
doing actually where river its 830 and
7:30

44
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:28,600
start that would be the first it was a
chance to work every down back down and

45
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:50,780
you really see how it went to see this
year if you added things like that but

46
00:17:50,780 --> 00:18:06,180
yeah it's not actually just more
attraction of hours right shoe number

47
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,600
versus just internationalization

48
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:42,379
5434 attacks there and say you know just
three something here already juice

49
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:53,380
production

50
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:00,810
something like that is when they noticed
a change your password and email to

51
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:29,370
explain that we will see some production
sites that works best for the students

52
00:19:29,370 --> 00:20:04,199
work this is something because we are
not run but he still there were other

53
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:14,990
detection systems analyst group

54
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:32,230
well one thing that helps create a sort
of like ever tried out there we ever get

55
00:20:32,230 --> 00:22:09,350
your who is really the best way to text
000000 yet but one thing that it would

56
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:28,500
be difficult is it also allowed

57
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:59,780
one exception

58
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:30,540
you know many trips for real now 37 or
38 writes really also done some sort of

59
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:54,409
surgeries she's really rich here the
twelve years or so and you are sure to

60
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:13,100
hear those are very fuzzy you know 3632
something

61
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:34,129
maybe thirty so it's really lower or
that the bus yet

62
00:24:34,130 --> 00:25:06,150
your settings but it's a pretty solid
see you certainly heard that somewhere

63
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,780
she strips

64
00:25:12,780 --> 00:26:20,510
short scripts which parts of it
certainly would

65
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,049
order

66
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:55,770
yeah but it's all about and we were
walking around a third party let's just

67
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:13,879
meet but general seats

68
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:51,580
posts yes sir what did you expect your
neighbor use the morning and it's

69
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,929
directly

70
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:05,460
missile sort of direct government users

71
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:31,330
you know every year which is why he sort
of sorts for me it's gonna check your

72
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:47,850
2006

73
00:28:47,850 --> 00:29:14,549
you got everything which it's true

74
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:37,900
orders work she works with users
understand quite sure what's this about

75
00:29:37,900 --> 00:30:07,720
you lots of that is treated so here we
are in search easier
