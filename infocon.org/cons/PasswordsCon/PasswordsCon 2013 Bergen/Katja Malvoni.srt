1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,450
a.m.

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,410
so

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,290
well he on

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,849
call presentations a while

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,560
source to up while

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,959
I yes

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,400
all you now no

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,769
yes Mike yes well

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,810
someone 40 a

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,410
%um beaker in you

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,480
Jays I y'all I would be interested I'll

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,300
nasa yes lease I'm

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,739
when culture arrived on Saturday I

14
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:56,760
to say I'm really sorry course and solo

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,849
yes it's only while the

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,449
sessions in Jason yes assume your boy

17
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,759
it is its up nichols'

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,970
I'll so i sat I'm sorry cost you 10

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,630
because me yes yo

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,860
but I'm you

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,479
go such a poor sorry

22
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,009
them but this my home phone from

23
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,259
for ratio a let you do the rest your

24
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,280
Russian and up thank you

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,380
yet thank you hello everybody

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,860
so they are all talking about but the
different approach to

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,829
record crop it cracking I'll talk about
energy efficiency

28
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:44,850
so you can see here maker

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,860
it is not well it's not friendly

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,979
though the front cover proper sewing is
still this

31
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,630
you go ask yourself why even bother
measures drop it

32
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,199
people a career at the brick breaker
there's a very good job so

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,500
what should the do but Rico

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,600
all of these devices each of them has a
different characteristics

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,440
that the matches a bigger specialties

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,670
303 later during this stock that the

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,829
every other devices as parallel it be
fun is that

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,220
or vilify personal per

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,349
different things that match or not much

40
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,609
a their group as hashing algorithm

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,690
the record is based on

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,890
blowfish books I for a

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,609
what's so special about the vector
visits a user-defined growth I think

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,430
a your user can control difficulty of
computation

45
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,670
another thing that makes the

46
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,829
Becker difficult to implement on some
popcorn sharp sell them

47
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,250
around a memory accesses and then the
last thing you've memory usage

48
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,430
marry her for kilobytes for storing as

49
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,370
as boxes and 72 bytes for storing the
boxes

50
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,989
it's important to say that for
historical reasons

51
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,150
cause steals the for breaking up this
five

52
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,430
and all three years Houston and the book
will be for that goes that thing but

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,530
it's not recommended

54
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,129
the was it for protecting your own
system it should be higher

55
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,829
such as then our well a

56
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,780
Blowfish encryption a causes this is
actually

57
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,830
her sixty the beating both a text before
but simple books

58
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,519
with the far-flung network I works like
this

59
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,500
this a function also they fell from
those boxes

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
abc&d are different

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,580
there are four bytes of well they bring
the

62
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,830
most significant one the most
significant one

63
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,150
and these up so they're honest Gaza

64
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,230
the boyfriend when with 32-bit load from

65
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,379
as boxes a

66
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,679
explicitly schedule blowfish algorithm

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,950
in a in its States initializes ice boxes
with the

68
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,970
digits of lumber by and then with expand

69
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,100
K all real then what they do is they

70
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,020
replace a a importar they replace P
boxes and this

71
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,030
boxes throughout the thought so every

72
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,809
of this expertise the does a

73
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,330
bigger a clip shim the

74
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,740
thousand 42 times to replace all
interesting not be books

75
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,320
and for as boxes the

76
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,610
most coaster book love this

77
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,030
other economies this repeat the love the
power of course

78
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,219
a service so expensive a exponent key is
a

79
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,500
rip repeated over and over again pick up
over time itself

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,770
use a six-person cue blowfish set up

81
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,460
and them and the states that the return
with the

82
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,080
this subpart is a group that with the

83
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,140
the following drink and the return those
were

84
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,080
crash also the first

85
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,700
implementation I'll be talking about
isn't it be funny

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,599
deep which is part of parallel port 'em

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,940
a bit funnier the picture is a

88
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,969
very friendly the big trip because of
her

89
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,860
bigger think racial nature and it's also
energy-efficient

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,370
it's just 30 particular parts of local
memory

91
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,420
which is more than enough to store inca
for

92
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,750
feel about the first books isn't some
bit more for people

93
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,230
are also think before register floating
point unit 39 the germ old

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,740
loath or instructions the clothing store
double berth

95
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,590
and other it's interesting that though
it but it's possible to directly address

96
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,010
course will commemorate the there are
also some

97
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,750
so problems because FB ruin entered in
the germ ok can

98
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,080
the can execute the only at and

99
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,419
Molly structures and for big group
really that's our friendship some stuff

100
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,550
like that so more

101
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,900
logical the sorry but thanks structures

102
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,349
problem is also their own a simple
addressing modes

103
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,520
a saw minute full use more registers

104
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,349
there for example a 96 sorry picture a
where

105
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,770
there are in this case links

106
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,090
so this is a call a brief moment looks
like there are six before

107
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,330
chips with three different Metro or
chips use the route to the data

108
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,330
and it has a local memory

109
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,109
her just number so consumption and

110
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,500
performance numbers

111
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,620
so this is how it all started

112
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,050
sour June

113
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,930
the first algorithm was written only in
C

114
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,460
and first working with the car call can
perform a full

115
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,020
830 the no cracks per second

116
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,890
and I still remember that moment when
the thing actually work

117
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,060
and I was so happy to see it working
that they didn't care about performance

118
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,140
those it works and them after ordered
them to use it as a phone showed me

119
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,159
well other effective

120
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,210
performances hours or

121
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,270
well at least it works so the next
optimization was

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,849
to more ok or go through

123
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,670
ok ought to call local memory so that
there are install Savannah

124
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,440
trying to fetch instructions for extra
memory but there is also the speedup

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,040
together for four months of for 930
cracks per second

126
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,080
and the that was a limitation under her
picture

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,180
compiler wasn't the able even though
rear

128
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,630
specifies we want to FB you in the
pleasure boat

129
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,310
compile what wasn't able sexually the
Schedule meet at birth use the family

130
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,870
called

131
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,490
that they actually at uses both FB you
and

132
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,270
integer lol so the next for both to do

133
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,840
right to simply and to use militia

134
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,740
with just three behind is actually
instruction scheduling

135
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,209
yes it's written on paper because the
home

136
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,848
first up the attempt was lower than
compiler generated growth

137
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,750
and next three of them as well so I
decided to write a paper

138
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,860
girl cycle mark when it's fine

139
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,130
when they are a little sis and stuff
softer lot of lots of

140
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,340
lots of trials and errors finally

141
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,690
the dolly sure was you successfully in
which gay performance of

142
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,690
now her seventy six cycles a group per
second

143
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,920
the one Baker distances running on a
single core doesn't have enough

144
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,709
parallelism to fully use the to Alicia
picture

145
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,710
because other four cycles latency

146
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,880
a when using FB or so

147
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,080
really in that third another victory
distance

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,360
though bring enough amount of
parallelism

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,830
so that the we can actually use

150
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,650
the Aleutian even but that first thing
was still

151
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,819
the open sea and see a call early the

152
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,450
willette compiler be able to do
something on its own

153
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,620
it wasn't really for a performance is a

154
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,550
less than optimized the single is the
score

155
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,579
then I'll read it preloader of PRI's

156
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,990
because it's so using every iteration
offer replacing as book centrist

157
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,710
and compiler wasn't the was a

158
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,230
fine with prolonged and they've been 36
registers

159
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,790
so the performance was almost 1,000
expecially

160
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,199
them and the last part was to do the
same schedule Inc

161
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
as it was done it one if those looked as
though it withdrew

162
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,230
and exploit those the much bar a little
restriction

163
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,510
instruction level as possible this is
offered with

164
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,760
performer so for 1000 200 the

165
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,660
Press per second a

166
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,880
and Richard but not door

167
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,910
220 so many Muslim jungle

168
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,030
mailing list to finish this
implementation

169
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,660
so this is the

170
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,560
affirmed in part of implementation

171
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,180
so there's a the MPA and BR for first

172
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,239
and thicken the census and they are
interleaved

173
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,380
to have a enough for love to cover
letter C for using gift for you

174
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,070
those email and it

175
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,610
instructions are actually executed on
the appeal so for

176
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,550
each of those we got one cycle free
because they were able to

177
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,030
there's a good lewis structures in one
cycle

178
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,530
another very useful thing gonna be for
me

179
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,920
are double floats where it can a

180
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
the river able to do it in

181
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,270
harmful cycles that would need if there
would not be

182
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,670
couple

183
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,910
so the in total we have to break in a
break at this time to spare encore

184
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,250
a Realty month in assembly used

185
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,940
the only shot picture and integrated
been

186
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,750
John the Ripper so this is how it looks
like this is for

187
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,140
it be funny with a 16 course and for a
be funny with

188
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,939
64 cores

189
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,320
the so this is efficiency of Architektur

190
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,470
it's a six-a 100 the growth

191
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,670
per second Barack because it be funny

192
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,420
PDP is two outs about the

193
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,300
even though there are some a your

194
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,329
evil even though her picture is a

195
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,720
isn't the

196
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,750
a Epiphany is a Rebecca friendly

197
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,140
but the its problem is that the FBI you
can

198
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,870
only sure two types of a structure that
would actually mean it

199
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,170
but nevertheless so we achieved very
good girl

200
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,020
performer think a very thoughtful the
integer deletion

201
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,610
picture on a bit funny

202
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,240
64 the performances are almost

203
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,590
four times as a four times bigger than
that before the 16

204
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,130
so we have excellent scalability with 19
9.7 percent the

205
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,420
officials say and the only thing me
change in growth around before the 64

206
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,510
with this

207
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,760
actually two times one on a call side

208
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,960
wanna be fun side so it's also

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,350
very portable called

210
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,560
missus how the system looks like so it's
actually

211
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,239
FOMC which can her either before the 16
or 64

212
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,350
written that book

213
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,650
the next spot for Rios is a more

214
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,670
with the its earn girl

215
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,599
ARM Cortex process or and FPGA fabric

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,170
this architecture is a interesting
because of a mostly because of Persia

217
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,949
fabric so the first thing was to
implement

218
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,630
communication between FPGA and repeals

219
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,080
which is on the following very sorry
have a cortex

220
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,220
here but thats where im of the report we
use the MA

221
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,570
to get all the data in the shared via

222
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,589
Baker rates data from shared Vera

223
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,720
and communicates with the cortex on this
most affluent board

224
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,740
were gore-tex with the gonna read

225
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,060
both offer accessible register soon be
grouped to control the state machine the

226
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,910
controller

227
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,910
action beginning of a computation to
rate for the end on the computation

228
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,089
the first implementation of our site
earth for around

229
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,230
dialysis summarized here sorry though

230
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,200
though measure

231
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,220
first implementation was 13.92 creeks
first

232
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,500
per second on actually using only one

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,990
bigger the stance on a number two this
through the state machine

234
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,330
Andrea Roth Asha shared be Rama's

235
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,700
shown on the previous light sought this
third of course from but they

236
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,610
the AMA is connected to one and bigger
to another so we were able

237
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,960
there was only one the be on board

238
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,570
actually read the paper which made this
implementation

239
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,029
really slow because a we have to rate

240
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,400
for the data and actually read it for
thought

241
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,430
for the next optimization was the

242
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,829
the copay as boxers into

243
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,350
locally Santos hurricane use both fourth

244
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,980
and those who ever do lookups in one
cycle

245
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,060
and then compute no a L

246
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,319
and air with this approach we were able
to free at 4pm course

247
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,570
with the performance of 311

248
00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:00,790
cycles per second a group perfect

249
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,349
the then early of the month that

250
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,500
to the for azbox

251
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,500
lookups at the one a at the one cycle

252
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,390
make cycle rate for data from the BIOS

253
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,949
the to do that we have to split daytime

254
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,790
the actually to a different be around

255
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,449
very have a do as boxes in one and
throughout the night in another

256
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,620
so that we can the use in thought that
too

257
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,640
course for each one in total have four
as book

258
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,000
as books look up so into a single course

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,510
regroup have 79 a gross per second

260
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,910
a it still fruits 14 course

261
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,310
so its own 180 crooks per second

262
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,760
in theory this would give this number
four for poor

263
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,890
for performance by their overheads

264
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,230
above for actually computing

265
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,160
barklow for bigger trash on arm

266
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,579
processor because only due to the cost
for

267
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,148
2002 to the power of course a loop is
implemented

268
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:14,569
you know if PGA

269
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,970
a in total this work for two cycles

270
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,929
her for five to let worker all and the
course they're of up to 100

271
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,959
megahertz a hearing her over your I'll
utilization

272
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,679
there are well rooms the

273
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,790
so this is performers perform for

274
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,340
Barack the single a second figure is
only for FPGA

275
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,629
and the third one is for whole system is
a

276
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,350
or so the accounting golf course book
because option as well

277
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,969
there is a lot of room for improvement

278
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,330
for this implementation at the moment
the

279
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,928
looks lot in the cellular localization
locks

280
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:03,760
well in saying it's too high we should
be able to

281
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,379
fruit much more course on the plaza were
at the moment

282
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,000
there is problem with support logic
support largest is

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,620
p.m. et 3xa buses Antonis in the
serialization ban

284
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,439
sexually copy data into a very stern as
boxes

285
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,850
so we also need to reduce that because
one turn to for

286
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,780
born to being consumed by that that's
too much

287
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,178
a we also need to consider some the
Zeiss at the moment there is only

288
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,340
unfinished state machine per core

289
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,040
we need dry the interleaving more on
them to use the logic better for her

290
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,250
to and result though also

291
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,420
optimist since we don't have problems
with the look relatively station

292
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,830
there's also in a opportunity that we
can

293
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,870
use only one is books per barrel so that

294
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,729
with 1/4 reactors only they don't even
think about the computation

295
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,580
and over the other port reactions
beethoven initializing

296
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,010
the as boxes and when reading the data

297
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,640
and also we need to improve
communication because it determined the

298
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,200
longest

299
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,900
but so did the tournament go rock cycle
a clock frequency

300
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,150
and its the took away

301
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,860
third of the poor

302
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,080
so next architecture that's interesting
is film fart

303
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,090
it's interesting because offer it's a
vector professor unit

304
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,470
Rica execute for 16 32-bit integer
operations

305
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,760
per clock cycle and

306
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,580
the hell 6 the course which each show
for core support

307
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,800
for credit so replied

308
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,240
the first mostly was on a scholar units

309
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,020
and to build John the Reaper Jordan
reaper with open embed

310
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,400
and open CL overtures older than these
performances

311
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,580
and next birthday poster use a director
producer erector producer unit

312
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,389
her for that we have to be careful to
stay

313
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,360
other memory user stays below

314
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,370
cash earlier than they thought their
size adjuster to kill both

315
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,719
because if we act exceed cache size with
the

316
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,410
the we want have a better reading in the
next cycle

317
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,020
when doing this book will looks up
lookup

318
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,679
a we also because of that we need to
solve for kilobytes for

319
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,340
4s boxes and so that the bars for people
to switch gears

320
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,830
so many of them to us running Burke or
so

321
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,139
a read we tried all that and little

322
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,620
possible combinations this was the one
that resulted with high

323
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,729
higher have performers saw

324
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,809
not exactly what we expected because a

325
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,990
although God /url also exist a

326
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:02,990
they'd don't then to show also they
didn't help us to improve performance

327
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,110
so with it a we also tried also with its

328
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,719
area X through intrinsics the first coat
was written by Steve Thomas

329
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,210
the following performance

330
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,610
and let it was expecting linger

331
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,320
that doctor if size because it was using
ca

332
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,580
a status that this perk or which is more

333
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,040
than 32 kilobytes so

334
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,928
we try to stay in cash and to reorganize
the cold

335
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:37,420
for reorganized a change memory loss lie
out

336
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,000
and a using

337
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,440
so in a sense of eight ish photos which
resulted with this

338
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,280
performance but the nunnery so-called
binge on the Reaper

339
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,440
is actually much faster then using every
x2 and it's got a lot

340
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,660
%uh so we can conclude that the loads
are just slow

341
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,660
and recall that the future seep youth
the better

342
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,090
borger power consumption be divided in
pool

343
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,970
regrouped similar devices together so
for CPU

344
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,059
because through some impressive figures
for the

345
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,530
performers but the efficiency is very
low for older

346
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,049
because it CPU the be curbed his mother
at their friendly

347
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,400
to to the ACPOS

348
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,130
business these are full %uh system the
power consumption figures

349
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,460
this table is more for you to look at
the there for me to read it

350
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,280
so just go over those

351
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,960
then we have the same 4G for GP you

352
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,860
and the self I so good you can see

353
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,379
some nice figures performance but

354
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,809
very low efficiency

355
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:59,120
and then we have our energy efficient
bookstores

356
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,580
a richter motion preface officials say

357
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,559
figures and performance

358
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,240
which is a bit lower so how it looks
like when we compare other similar

359
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,559
her dog referee sorry are comparing the
phone is still

360
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,450
x86 course because through all the
performances

361
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,960
pretty much the same efficiency is much
higher

362
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,420
gonna be funny but worth the court threw
for before any with 16 course

363
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,760
and here for a be funny 64 cores

364
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,260
in total for record with her

365
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,420
a again mystery for so far GP-one

366
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,670
CPU that performance numbers are hard

367
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,940
what officials is low or for it be funny
it sir

368
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,980
through a nice performance comparable
the CPU's

369
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,980
and much higher energy efficiency

370
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,360
so i hella sure there are here brought
the

371
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,678
that were with me and

372
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,140
here I'm a them going

373
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,730
integration with the John the Ripper

374
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:20,010
and the more that burn speed so

375
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,120
what no it's connected with the

376
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:31,120
you have been still short

377
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:43,290
in

378
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,350
okay saw her here a fake half I'll

379
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:56,350
over the past or at least forces at work

380
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,490
for prefer to 16

381
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:19,909
the end for refund for

382
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,350
so this lifestyle already I'm as they
hoped would

383
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,620
for other booth also Don

384
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,909
with performance of run

385
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,130
and and be fined $60m

386
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:47,130
as well

387
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:53,040
her so for the future for perot it be
funny

388
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,180
what sir very good about this
architecture is the fact that beeper

389
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,830
has a trip to ship links for integrated
up to 64 chips

390
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,889
on a single board if we use the a

391
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,240
with 64 chips first with 54 course

392
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,230
beget theoretical performance offer
300,000 creeks per second

393
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,820
which is really nice figure but that's
only theoretical

394
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,460
interpolation let's go a brilliantly and
portability offer

395
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,250
current implementation is really
promising for a 3GS

396
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,770
what we're going to do is to do all
those that were optimizations

397
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,930
mentioned on a what the room from
improvement Floyd

398
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,600
earlier we plan to target bigger 3GS

399
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,969
and more the target the have bridges
Bush author 2:30 expert for a spot on a

400
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,730
3GS

401
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,150
and

402
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,650
what that's like you remember is that

403
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,810
multi-core low-power iscar

404
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,060
what form sir are a nice match those

405
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,200
whatcha for for to break the what are
now smidge

406
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,480
the bigger pension other at them and the

407
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,750
are able to achieve a very high a

408
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,630
energy efficiency what's also important
that the

409
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,450
higher energy efficiency to enable us
hard the city

410
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,180
because we can have a motions for boorda

411
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,040
not more both per system and

412
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,740
with all this and didn't use a six and
we still gotta

413
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,650
energy efficiency that sir by factor of
them both

414
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,290
bigger than some other platforms but
although 6

415
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,250
will do better from

416
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,330
I'd like to thank to certain date the

417
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,830
for writing first be creeped open seal
coat

418
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,560
for Steve Thomas for for writing

419
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,879
for speaker go that uses Avex intrinsics

420
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,260
the parallel a project for providing us

421
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,620
axis to parallel abort and two

422
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,620
reformer of cold and aggression

423
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,480
yes

424
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,360
the question Rosa what I think if it's a

425
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,620
possible to the change regroup

426
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,668
and other another parameter for
competitions the

427
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:56,130
Richard the crease efficiency of for
Michael

428
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,480
my implementation saw for it be funny
book

429
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,549
a free for example at couple of

430
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,110
for a

431
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,370
for example couple of instructions that
they feel supports an integer mold

432
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,750
then I reader get even more parallelism
one instruction level

433
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,130
so it might be possible to reschedule
instructions

434
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,330
so that the FB you save us because %uh
for

435
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,360
authors of cycle through would normally
use for computing modification

436
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,490
but the if those on modifications

437
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,580
would be logical instructions that with

438
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,480
we would have a problem because we don't
have a bar

439
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,539
we don't weekend he was a feel for that
it

440
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,610
had the wrong are as medic unit and
without additional cycles

441
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,610
and for FPGA things current

442
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,219
lot other legislation is really high
adding anything there would reduce it

443
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,700
lower

444
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,049
bickered core count so it will decrease
efficiency

445
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:04,070
as through energy efficiency and these
other systems that we used her

446
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,908
real all TDP of two outs for a be fine
Egyptian

447
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:11,570
something like that for said board so a

448
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,820
energy efficiency with state really high
as

449
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,820
is now good

450
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:34,940
you thank you

451
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:54,210
him

452
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:59,130
you actually brothers are excellent you
can get the

453
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,490
repeat the question aggression Wilson

454
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,539
can I say something about prices though
however videos

455
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,980
so for parallel aboard the simplest
model is a

456
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,620
ninety nine dollars the Biggers are

457
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,270
199 dollars so very cheap the

458
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,340
this that what I have here is around the
four hundred dollars

459
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,030
so US fiddler's a saw

460
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:30,480
it still VeriChip but there are some
other things for you

461
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,260
however reels for example I

462
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,230
in the process of Richard shoot very
high a efficiency but

463
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,679
low energy efficiency cost her on the no

464
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,260
101 1500 US dollar seat

465
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,940
so are part of our actually

466
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:55,940
locals

467
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,249
no yes or it right that have a try

468
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:10,799
the the question was a have retried
increasing the workload of

469
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,859
be trippin see how it affects a
performance numbers

470
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,109
so the Droid be cursed be trip for cost
well

471
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:21,369
and 14 and then a not performance

472
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:25,019
decreases the aside scholar

473
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,850
and the but the efficiency is much
higher because communication overhead

474
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,779
and other overheads reviews because a in
big groups

475
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:37,679
what for takes a very most the
computation time is a

476
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,249
due to the power of course slope so

477
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:45,159
Ritter increasing load we actually get
better efficiency

478
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,690
and the power consumption so is roughly
the same

479
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,090
all although on a the school system's

480
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,129
with the CPU and the on

481
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:58,918
big cooler so the phone calls the North

482
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,720
lot of power softer a 52nd also

483
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,349
because of the power consumption schools
up because of for

484
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:10,019
additional power use to to called the
system

485
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:13,720
but for our a plot for not the case they

486
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:20,720
do not overheat like that

487
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,630
the question is a can I explain why GP
implementation has sought

488
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,820
such low performance so it's a because a

489
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,450
big group of for a lot of memory so so
for kilobytes

490
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,710
a response and it means that memory

491
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,350
a doc says it's a crash early cycle by
cycle so

492
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,320
a local memory LNG PO the

493
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,889
has led to see if there are four cycles
richest too much

494
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,690
for a efficient bigger implementation so
we need

495
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,800
everything to fit into and a Turkish

496
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,270
ownership you it's very small sorry
under a

497
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,800
applies to people maybe 1/4 of it it
sexually

498
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,800
youth to compute be grouped and that's
why the performances soul

499
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,190
%ah

500
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,980
so yeah
