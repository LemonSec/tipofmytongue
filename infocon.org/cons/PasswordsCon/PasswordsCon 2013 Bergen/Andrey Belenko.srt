1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,380
is other for many of us Mahal

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,200
the I

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,599
was either

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,520
and I'm some of for

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
for us lie the owner

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,410
tired yeah i mean %uh

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,990
other story was yeah

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,820
but I'll go head-to-head ourselves

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,900
what you look like I'm he was

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,150
yeah first for on the second hour I'm
doing wrong he was

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,180
just like more on the second day

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,500
he can sued watch almost like

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,450
bud you fucking

14
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,870
him really up

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,570
okay so no here this is only like

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,020
I would just say unique wall

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,020
by yep thank you very much no one small
correction we're friends ex's

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,649
in Chicago what your eyes to work from
moscow

19
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,790
around today I would like to

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,000
tell you a little bit about I clout
keychain and changes to data protection

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,990
I or something

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,089
so let's start with the

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,510
shorter and simpler part with the data
protection else

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,420
someone you might know the protection
that is a set of technologies

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,990
in I was operating system their designs
to

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,949
protect user data from

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,110
unauthorized access those technologies
include several

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,570
different mechanisms on one of them and
were important one

29
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,710
you the key chain keychain is a storage
all

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,169
boss works basically the central stores
have passwords

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,200
and I worst managers that storage

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,340
kitchen was there in iPhone since the
very beginning since the very first

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,239
iPhone

34
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,579
but before I was four it was well

35
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:19,170
not very good the encryption key that
was used to protect passwords

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,190
was mom fixed for particular device so

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,889
every device well speaking in a way

38
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:30,709
every device can with the hard coded key
that was protecting

39
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,630
the key chain and no matter how many
times you

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,109
was that wipe your device the key remain
the same so obviously that was no good

41
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:43,840
boats fortunately starting with I was
for

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,169
and going forward able resigned the
keychain Christian completely

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,519
it was now using random for item keep

44
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,980
and that he was in tune

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,048
protected with another he would was

46
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,810
that was based on design item
accessibility and the

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,630
what exactly is item disagree with well
it is

48
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,780
basically a since

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,139
hard to explain well some implications

50
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,489
needs to access kitchen items when
they're running

51
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,739
when the device is unlocked other device
might need to access

52
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,350
kitchen items one device is locked well
think

53
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,820
about this if you're designing for
example browser

54
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,019
and you're adding future like

55
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:35,690
well outlook complete football source or
something like that

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,980
it is very likely that no browser will
all need to access

57
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,090
stored bosworth only one device is
unlocked

58
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,530
so there is no way user will browse the
internet world devices looks right

59
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,750
so you can specify that

60
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,040
these kitchen item must be protected
with the

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,900
must be accessible only one the device
is unlocked

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,120
on the other hand if you're designing
something like email application

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,910
that application might want to access
the the store password even the devices

64
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,750
look for example

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,320
if publications fetching Malian
background this must be specified

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,358
mom the so application

67
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,260
wants to access password even then there
was little and this is what

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,840
iight mixes abilities -5

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,010
modified kitchen encryption a little bit
first the wall

70
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,650
it switched from as: CBC mode to

71
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,409
on GCM go account mood which is
authenticated encryption which is a very

72
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,259
good step

73
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:42,050
or encryption keys remained

74
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,090
also per item random Q's was another

75
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,799
major improvement was that beginning
with rs5

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,650
not only passwords themself but also all
the meta data associated with the

77
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,340
kitchen items such as login name
servername creation date: modification

78
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,739
date

79
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,860
however this stuff was also in cryptids
so

80
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,099
beginning with I was 5 omitted it is
also in Group A and you might

81
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,719
you may ask how Apple's from the search
on the kitchen well

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,909
in addition but before that

83
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,039
they store them into dating plain text
and

84
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,750
password was incorrect now everything is
in cryptic but they stole the

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,199
so one has submitted that meta-data
items

86
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,400
in the database of instead of storing
example creation date:

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,590
the store hash on the creation date:
instead of

88
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,840
storing user name the store Henschel the
username this way

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,119
application can steal perform some sort
some curious

90
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,530
on keychain to will call

91
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,059
on the item's another major

92
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,159
compliment to the protectionist or jerk
reaction it was

93
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,300
introduced you know I was four well
something that wasn't a two hundred

94
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,599
years before but so I will say that

95
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:01,360
before I'll I was four encryption was
there are merely to

96
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,900
facilitates foster device wipe it was
not designed to provide any sort of

97
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,179
confidentiality

98
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,020
but beginning with OS four mmm
encryption

99
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,878
was implemented properly it is a file
level encryption

100
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,999
mom in the sense it is very much like

101
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:22,650
Microsoft Windows encrypted filesystem
it's not like

102
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,090
PGP whole disk encryption or Linux damn
creeped

103
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,830
or all the walk on corruption

104
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,128
things and this is why carving for
deleted files

105
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:39,080
he's nearly impossible on Apple devices

106
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,240
precription is Don were similar to the
kitchen item encryption every for oil

107
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,780
I'm is included with the random key and
that key

108
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,900
isn't running cryptid with the
protection key

109
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,359
based on Protection Clause protection
clauses the same as

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,430
disability clause for kitchen items with

111
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,020
Roos for we had only to such losses

112
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,938
well protection on which mount the files
in cryptid what can be accessed

113
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,479
without at all times even if device is
locked

114
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,610
and fall protection complete and files
protected with this one could be

115
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,340
opened only wendy was these unlocked

116
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,698
and that is not side on this only a.m.

117
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,249
I know some check Eve devices Lok

118
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:29,009
then don't allow this file to be opened
this was in force though

119
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,819
and reinforced cryptographically so
devices look there's just no encryption

120
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,900
key that could

121
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,310
the crib that file

122
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,830
on I was 5 at its to nuke losses

123
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,669
mom one complete until first user
authentication

124
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:50,029
reach prevented

125
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,009
access to the file want to use our have
unlock the device at least once

126
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,349
and once the was unlocked that file
remind accessible

127
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,930
until the devices power both or rebooted

128
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,210
and second be one was complete on this
open that was

129
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,239
that one is a my were interesting

130
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,259
it is based on public public key crypto

131
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,499
no specifically to use Daniel

132
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:19,309
ben Stein score 255 19

133
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:23,389
and the what the closed doors is that
you can create

134
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,949
file and open it mean for creation at
any time even if device is locked

135
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,469
and you can write to you but wants to
close the file handle

136
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,529
you can only open that file if the
device is unlocked so this is very

137
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,400
useful for things like

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,468
receiving emailing the ground taking
pictures without unlocking the

139
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:47,510
device and so on so what's new with I
was something

140
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,449
well with encryption staff the stores in
Group Inc

141
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,939
I haven't seen any anything noticeable

142
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,639
existing tools continue to work and they
don't seem to

143
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,889
gonna screw things up so everything
works within the group

144
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,730
and everybody's have been there is one

145
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,810
thing now Apple is

146
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,510
encouraging developers to use protection
possible cause

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,300
well protection parts have been
introduced back in I was four times with

148
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,540
choose like three years ago boats
adoption

149
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,420
among developers was very very low so
nobody cares about this nobody uses that

150
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,649
because this is like

151
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,970
love brain damage so how Apple approach
is this

152
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,339
problem well typical Apple matter now
going to fold everything is a group that

153
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,899
with the most restrictive

154
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,170
Protection Clause so if you want your a
call

155
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,170
or your application not to crash

156
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,969
well you have to figure out why it
crashes and change the protection loss

157
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,410
and whatever

158
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,449
and the this is actually serious
problems

159
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,180
so I faced the crash because all that

160
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,519
my application was writing to log file

161
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,810
text text law mom obligations writing
too long all the time

162
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,138
and that application was also performing
some

163
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,500
passing background on the development
was everything was fine

164
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,260
everything works nothing crushes
Roulettes boost production let's push to

165
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,949
production

166
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,620
first test crash why because the
production devices health

167
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,810
bosko's when device is locked

168
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,119
well Oct after 10 seconds after the
device is locked

169
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,630
encryption keys are removed from the
memory and

170
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,939
all the file handles become on rightful

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,310
so we have a crush through yeah

172
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,160
think Apple for

173
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,110
forcing the encryption and that was not
even Michael that was a open source

174
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,649
library for writing logs

175
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,820
so it was actually

176
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,949
a problem inside the source code hall
that library

177
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:56,439
well key chain keychain from Aunt has
changed with so

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,470
encryption hasn't changed while the on

179
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,740
in Korengal data and meta-data his
changed

180
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,600
before that Apple has used to buying rip
Robert least in calling in now

181
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,589
they're using gas and at one which is
interesting

182
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,500
well you don't really see people
switching from something protrude

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,740
proprietor to something standard every
day

184
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,750
so the question

185
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,529
which ahead is by are they doing this so
I don't know the answer

186
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:29,630
the definite ones answer but here on 3
speculations on the point

187
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,550
first and probably the most important
one that a son but one

188
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,750
basic including rules or distinguished
going rules

189
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,630
the sequential so you can actually
receive the stream and parse it as it

190
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,329
arrives

191
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,769
with a binary proper to least you
actually have to receive

192
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,120
all the data because the table of
contents on

193
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
located at the end of the stream

194
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,490
this is one advantage the second one is
the this and that one is more compact

195
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,670
and it is cross-platform so this may be
a king that

196
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,819
keychains coming to Windows or I know

197
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,740
maybe maybe not so that's it about data
protection and now lets move

198
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,160
to like low key chain well I quote you
choose was

199
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,110
arguably one of the most hyped futures

200
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,800
it was presented at WWDC back in June

201
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,290
but unfortunately some other revelations

202
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,300
by snowden they came at about the same
time

203
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,199
and so pool become much less vocal about
this feature

204
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,529
in the actually introduced it with the

205
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,740
the future was present in all I was
seven batters

206
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,120
it was not present in I was 7 release
and it was

207
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,889
reintroduced only with the release of or
or stand Mavericks

208
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,990
in October hmm

209
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,589
so let's talk about this little more
detail so

210
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,850
why do this well I'll

211
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,069
first we'll have to say that this is not
a this is really in my twenty percent

212
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,550
project at work so it's not something I
put a lot of effort into

213
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,829
what still well yeah

214
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,888
the motivation was this so Apple makes a
lot of claims about security so they

215
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:09,949
state that

216
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,729
for missions in group 2 and cannot be
read by Apple and more interestingly

217
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,910
people can't access in you know the key
material that

218
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,779
from can be that could be used to group
that the to

219
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:29,389
long so I think it's natural desire to
know whether this is true or not

220
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:33,740
so let's and it's not only about a porno

221
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,269
because there are others

222
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,319
who me force able to reveal some
information

223
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,380
and the

224
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm not saying that Apple wants to read
my data but will email you want to know

225
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,899
is do they have the technical
possibility to

226
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:56,810
hand over my data in any detectable or
whatever form

227
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,518
not take that take your pictures it

228
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,959
so let's get back to I clout well

229
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,170
II code is the it's not one service

230
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,610
it's a certain over many many services
as you can see this is a

231
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,769
just screen you can see on your iPhone

232
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,629
when you can enable/disable different
services

233
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,730
and on the left you can see The
Associated configuration

234
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,790
part of the configuration file which is
unit

235
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,750
for every account so people has
technical ability to restrict serve

236
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,810
packaging services for particular count
but that's not the point that the point

237
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,989
on this line is that there are many many
services

238
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,329
that go by the name of like low and
today we will

239
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,370
look on don't want them

240
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,160
that are used by keychain by I called
teach you

241
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,850
those are kitchen sink and Q will you

242
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,060
so the first question when you want to
know why something the first

243
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,229
questions will work so

244
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,519
you don't have to look too hard because
the very same configuration file

245
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,629
contains

246
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:11,709
the and points the server names for the
services

247
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:15,449
we're interested in specifically you can
see the Urals

248
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,430
all those services so

249
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,459
their standards and the this be nineteen
so the the start with the

250
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:29,768
some random number which which is not
ruined a random and sequential so

251
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,350
as more people register for a play these
I think the temple

252
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,959
ad servers or names and so this is kind
of

253
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,719
poor man's load balancing so

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,269
now have this knowledge and we want to
figure out what exactly

255
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,360
gets months and still services so

256
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
we take the device set up the

257
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,800
I clout keychain and just sniff the
traffic

258
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,349
to figure out what's happening so it is
very easy to

259
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,209
see that keychain and key back

260
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:07,750
ascends to the Q value service and
something secret

261
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,389
something very secretive sent to escrow
proxy which is the

262
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,189
teach in sync service this is Q value
serves

263
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:19,160
I am few words about terminology

264
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,410
keychain a

265
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,719
to change your passwords and key back is
a set of keys

266
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,899
that are used to encrypt the keychain
the password inside your kitchen so

267
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,709
just this is able to my knowledge is so
I'm just trying to

268
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,439
explain its this simple as possible key
back is a set of keys

269
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:42,199
that encrypts keychain in key chains
just to set up

270
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,859
apostles and how exactly do we know this
well it's not theirs

271
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,199
not very hard because although every

272
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,349
is inside HTTPS there is no certificate
being so you just import your

273
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,740
certificates so the proxy and you see
all the data

274
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,970
in clear while

275
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,079
now let's so trying to figure out what
exactly

276
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,220
happens with this nom in more detail
because this is so obviously not

277
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,880
detailed enough we want no more

278
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,890
when you set up in hike low key chain
you actually have a number of options

279
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,950
the default he's mmm simple

280
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,890
i close security code four digits

281
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,010
let's see how it works what happens when
you enable these

282
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,110
first the wall around them password is
generated on the device

283
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,649
it looks like this so it is

284
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,730
24 24

285
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,230
random numbers a random characters

286
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,360
the next thing that happens and devices
that and Yuki back

287
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,020
is generated and bus was from the
keychain that a marked

288
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,160
as expert herbal as the ones that can be
uploaded to the IKE low key chain are

289
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,760
interested

290
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,840
with these Yuki back using years ago or

291
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,679
conta moved then

292
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,720
this random password is used to protect
that generated key back

293
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,300
so essentially this random password
becomes the master password for your

294
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,020
keychain inches

295
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,310
this is what this diagram cells

296
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,370
this stuff is then uploaded to Q value
service

297
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,659
don't the password only thing printed
stuff so

298
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,960
this is moralists okie

299
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,410
but what is missing from this picture

300
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,780
is my clothes security code there is no

301
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,800
on this picture so let's try to

302
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,480
find out what's happening to it so when
you enter a close cuticle

303
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,800
it is bird through

304
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,590
PDF to with the 10,000

305
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,939
thousand iterations and that key is used
to create random password

306
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,460
and the encrypt it random password the
sense to a school proxy

307
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,450
so now we have more or less the overall

308
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,590
architecture the I clout

309
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,379
keychain thing now let's

310
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,740
hmm let's see at what exactly is stored

311
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,260
in the he value

312
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,500
you build service well first of all let
me state that this is

313
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,850
this service is not new at all it was
probably the first

314
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,610
I call service introduced and daughter
publications

315
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,419
are using its to I keep preferences

316
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,770
in sync across devices 10 the

317
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,040
examples is was ample Safari on

318
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,470
uses this service to sync your opened

319
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,690
tabs on different devices so it's

320
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,740
it's not something exclusive 2 o'clock

321
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,260
Chi but a cloak you chain uses this

322
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,790
to stores in the what is interesting
about those sources that

323
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,170
you can see that it is it says clout
teaching proxies 3

324
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,160
and in during I was something better

325
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,110
it was just well kitchen proxy so
apparently there's been some

326
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,540
development and some last-minute changes
to the system

327
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,170
say with secure pick up to pick up 30

328
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,720
you pick up them so apparently Apple

329
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,300
changing something mom and during better
they have

330
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,740
perched those store several times for
all counts

331
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,740
on these those are the

332
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,460
tease and description of the values are
uploaded

333
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,570
to the I clout

334
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,590
as part of my clock key chain so
probably the most important one

335
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,790
is this one which contains meta data
such a so-called security

336
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,700
gold complexity so it's basically a flag

337
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,950
which tells you whether the security
code is simple four digits or something

338
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,750
more complex

339
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,300
nom timestamp and country

340
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,389
home

341
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,880
this shows whether the is cool services
used or not

342
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,680
we will get to this lemme later

343
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,780
this is the key bakke big is included
with the master password and you see

344
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,860
there is no

345
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,909
indication must mussah possible

346
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,090
is if you wrote earlier Mustapa sort is

347
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,570
sent to escrow proxy and what exactly
this group rocks

348
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,030
well this is an you service

349
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,220
and my guess is that it was designed
exclusion

350
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,750
4 o'clock each a buddy's were actually
more generic

351
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,110
it can store any number of Secrets data

352
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,379
any number of secret items access to the
Service requires

353
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,400
lemme authentication token and this is
how all I cloud services work

354
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,810
so you need to know played the and play
the password

355
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,950
are using that you authenticate why
clout and in return you get your number

356
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,040
account number and authentication token
and using the talking and number

357
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,040
you talk to all the services this is
this the case with this proxy

358
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,040
with this service you need the same
token to access the service

359
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,260
both to actually get data to I'm

360
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,510
reads data that was sent to the service

361
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,580
you need additional level of

362
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,949
authentication you need to receive an
SMS challenge

363
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,600
and he needs to complete and secure
email password authentication

364
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,629
SRP authentication the fun part about
this

365
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,780
on services that user agent the transom
I was in Norristown

366
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,850
is called like you too and the

367
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,889
if you google that you'll find though
that likely to is a

368
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,130
character from mario brothers Nintendo
game

369
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,570
which is the PLO so apparently there are
some

370
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,409
fusion in 10 the fans in in in Apple
California

371
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,920
and I have no idea who what like I clout
maybe there's some through

372
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,240
while like you too whatever

373
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,040
so the heart all the escrow proxy as you
can see here

374
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,830
is this secure remote password

375
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,159
what is it exactly secure remote
password is a protocol designed

376
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,480
by Stanford University in Stanford
University

377
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,650
which is is their knowledge possible
proof scheme

378
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,740
and the I'm not sure if

379
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,380
probably some you are familiar with this
if I'm not mistaken

380
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,660
10 the leaks from blizzard perhaps

381
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,870
the they have been using these for for

382
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,429
yeah I think so it's not

383
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,460
you but to actually do

384
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,030
I would say that this is probably the
most large-scale deployment of for

385
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,990
secure remote password in the

386
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,920
in moss like industries because the
blizzard was being well

387
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,730
level probe would be bigger know what's
the point of this protocol well

388
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,050
on it was designed with two goals in
mind first

389
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,260
be for you any plans so there are no
presence

390
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,330
called covering SRP and second
securities specifically

391
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,760
attacker that can snoop traffic or can
meet in traffic

392
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,580
cannot did use enough information to
perform

393
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,850
offline attack on the password so even
if you

394
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,490
have a man the middle condition on the
running a surplus

395
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,320
you cannot get like challenge response
or something you cannot

396
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,360
get enough data to than mountain

397
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,399
offline brute force attack

398
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,160
when implemented correctly on SRP will
only allow a tiger one possible guess

399
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,090
per connection so tiger connects to the
server

400
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,850
just as one possible tries to guess one
Password you the password is not correct

401
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,370
the server will drop the connection

402
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,750
so reconnect this enables like real to
use the throttle

403
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,340
throttling all the how possible to terms

404
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,350
another think is that password very far
is not sufficient for impersonation

405
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,620
this means that if server storage gets
compromised

406
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,030
for example if somebody gets hold of all
the by Kesha switch or call

407
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,930
password verifiers of all possible very
farce from Apple

408
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,550
they will not be able to use those
password required to work directly

409
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,850
to impersonate you to impersonate as a
user

410
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,699
they will have to first drawn through
like were forced to recover the original

411
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,310
passwords and the school proxy uses

412
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:33,810
the latest no version which is clear all
this political which is this a p60

413
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,040
so this is how the product works

414
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,320
diet consists of to mean faces

415
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,629
and before the political can start
parties have to agree

416
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,650
upon some the problem so they need to
select

417
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,200
has function they need to select group

418
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
and they need to select multiplayer key
which is well

419
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,300
in this case in case officer p6 a it is
hash

420
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,780
of parameters the password for if I was
the thing which is stored on the server

421
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,940
it consists all the salt which is random

422
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,300
and will you be which is generator to
the race to the power X

423
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,590
X computer from salt in your password so

424
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,919
the protocol itself ron's as follows:

425
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,310
so the device issue is the protocol he
generates

426
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,480
random number eighty raises generator to

427
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,950
power alien sense that a capital

428
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,830
along with the user ID to the server

429
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,949
server generates random number B
computes

430
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,960
this will you in sends it back to the
device now

431
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,430
both the server and the device perform
some mathematical operations

432
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,740
that result in the will you key he on

433
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,450
here he is the shit encryption key it is
the same for both

434
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,640
or the device and the server boats

435
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,140
to be absolutely certain about these

436
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,870
now both parties need to ensure that
they actually agreed on the same key

437
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,989
the need to make sure that the key is
the same on both ends

438
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,760
this is done during clear implication
face and the is done

439
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,810
this way both parties computer am

440
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,169
and then the device

441
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,350
nonsense and to the server server if I
was the time is correct and if it's not

442
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,189
and is very important

443
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,020
that server must drop the connection and
was not correct

444
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,290
and also it is also important that
device must present

445
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,670
its proof am first not the server

446
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,930
so in this sense everything is
implemented

447
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:41,540
correctly home

448
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,750
school proxy implements worry
non-standard SRP it's very by the book

449
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,860
so you can open the specification and
you can see that everything is just

450
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,169
exactly the treatment station there are
only few

451
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,410
minor changes well first the wall that
has function is

452
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,360
sha256: the group is to 2040

453
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,459
not be group from is fighting if 50-54

454
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,000
which is an RFC for SRP authentication
Intel s

455
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,330
and the protocol itself is Modifieds

456
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,360
to I accept some ass

457
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,949
challenge group so not only

458
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,210
random number and user ID is sand will
also German

459
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,640
SMS challenge which sent by the server
to the

460
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,720
users phone so

461
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,320
this is home

462
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,340
hold protocol works but how the exactly
exact process

463
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,750
works so

464
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,430
when deweiss when the device wants to
recover some data from the

465
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,150
school proxy its first not least

466
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,790
the lease the available school records
so

467
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,149
issues get recruits come into the server
and server

468
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,760
my response with the least of available
records

469
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,340
lawn device asks for the least of
Associated

470
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,000
phone numbers so its ron's get is a must
targets comment

471
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,510
and the server responds with a least of
phone numbers that are associated with

472
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,640
the

473
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,710
with an account long I'd like to say
that those phone numbers are used only

474
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,630
for display purposes so

475
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,600
the device will show you in traditional
something like we have sent you

476
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,500
an SMS to number blah blah blah please
enter this

477
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,770
the semester this mess coat

478
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,800
so device will not I like send this
number back it will not let

479
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,430
user to select the the phone number

480
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,780
sent a challenge to so

481
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:53,060
next the device requests that is a must
change 2 percent

482
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,350
on and the once user enters the

483
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,699
some is challenging to the device it
initiates

484
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,660
the Sappi protocol so a serbian its
moment

485
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,060
it accepts the yes I D the SAT is a
numeric

486
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,620
identical identify our of your a place
you which is probably

487
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,669
due to its services idea or something is
the random number is a must go to the

488
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,580
estimates change

489
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,939
and the server response with the unique
I the

490
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,000
all the transaction with the same this
ID

491
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,570
with random sold well sold associated
with the

492
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,950
with an account none will you be

493
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,070
and the after that

494
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:40,139
device requests the actual recall the
datum

495
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,950
so it computes well %um which is most
important piece of information here

496
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,370
and if and was correct server sir Wilson
Burke

497
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,760
ID and group 2 scrolled record and that
is true record is interrupted with the

498
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,040
key on K which is Shirky

499
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,490
mmm computer during the SRP
authentication

500
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,670
so probably this is too much

501
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,810
with yeah just bear with me fourth I
will try to explain this in

502
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,909
in more detail so what other comments
are available

503
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,150
up for this ne service well

504
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,260
they were first thing the device the
last when you and roll

505
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,620
when you name like welcome change to
wrong

506
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,879
get club sort comment I'm not sure what
is doing

507
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,920
probably get some certificates or
whatever

508
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,080
when a new I haven't seen it

509
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,129
used too much and roll

510
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,290
sense secret data to the service for for
storage

511
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,670
get rikers get us to miss targets
generous miss jones a subpoena to

512
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,350
recover

513
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,760
we have just covered the last one's
funny

514
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,180
on altruism as targets it

515
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,160
enables you to change the phone number
tour is this a mess with them

516
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,370
this is not exposed than ever in the UI
but I have a Python script but can do

517
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,159
this

518
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,680
so this actually leads me to believe
that the SMS has nothing to do with the

519
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,230
two-factor authentication at all

520
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,890
so this might be well some sort of a
rate-limiting

521
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,650
or whatever I don't know what um yeah
what one difference

522
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,720
this this think the only difference from
other comments is that

523
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,000
it requires you to supply play D and
password

524
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,040
it will not work if you supply
authentication token

525
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,010
so but jet if you know it lady and
password you can

526
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,300
choose any number you want so im you
don't have to worry about

527
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,180
this it's not it's not falling apart

528
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,500
its them I just don't think it's it's a
two-factor authentication in the in the

529
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,590
sense that we

530
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:53,350
you we used to so

531
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,409
it will be an 2-for-2 with education to

532
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,970
Khambhat you know situation where
somebody intercepted your suspicion

533
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,520
talking

534
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,420
but yeah or all honestly I think this is
very strange and also

535
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,310
a and the whole status on their website
this SMS think

536
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,990
it doesn't work in some countries
probably they don't have the global is a

537
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,810
must hours or something

538
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,980
so most countries to work no no way
works

539
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,520
Rushworth

540
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,860
but some don't and the yeah again
present so this thing

541
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,110
makes me think that this not exactly two
factor authentication

542
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,800
refused to so work a let's go back to

543
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,340
our strong record

544
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,879
look at this and that try to figure out
what exactly

545
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,370
we can get from this server well I can
help you

546
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,370
we real get as cruel record which is
random password encrypt it

547
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:54,600
with the T computed from the cloud
security code and our goal is to somehow

548
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,909
the group the passwords

549
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,300
well that a certain sense to the cloud
from the keychain into the group that

550
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,350
look if the teaching when it's too gets
random password and to get random

551
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,270
password we need

552
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:12,349
apparently to give get the key on to get
the Q we need to get a i close security

553
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,540
call so how do

554
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,009
we do this

555
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,589
well apparently this stop a store viable

556
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:24,699
on the on their servers

557
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:30,489
in a close security code is four digits
by default

558
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,918
anybody see the problem and rebel phase
that information

559
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,828
conundrum viable really really

560
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:47,029
well no my response is that yes they can

561
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:50,569
on and here's how

562
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:56,829
on if your Apple or anybody with similar
level of access you can go

563
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:02,339
they turned you can Ron offline guessing
on the i close security code

564
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:06,000
since there are only ten thousand
possible simple POSCO to

565
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,089
security codes that like will be almost
instant

566
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:15,390
and always successful we like low
security code you can to keep key back

567
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,078
cubic passports or yeah cubic password
will

568
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,299
the trip the the bike you back yes

569
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:26,980
and with unlock key back you can group
to all the kitchen items that are synced

570
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,599
to the eye closed

571
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,099
so long EPL or any other adversary with
similar level of access to the storage

572
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,559
can the recently the group must a
password and or call kitchen records

573
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,990
for default settings so apparently

574
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,549
this is I think this is

575
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:51,690
important No okay but what about all our

576
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,059
wrong setup options so so far we have
only

577
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:59,069
looked at the simple the default

578
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,549
but your I think everybody he
understands that

579
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:06,619
the fourth cannot be secure so what
about others

580
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:09,839
well use a complex security on well

581
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,509
diagrams exactly the same except that
the

582
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:19,890
settled simple four-digit we can use our
be too long

583
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,180
Ospreys or password

584
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,019
so everything is exactly the same one
Password Recovery still possible but say

585
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:29,450
it will

586
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,618
it won't be a successful because

587
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:35,670
there are much more possible passwords
and it won't be

588
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,710
like grantee to succeed

589
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,539
passwords are apparently more complex

590
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:47,529
but again i think is still possible
because we have data stored

591
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:51,730
in the school serves get random security
code

592
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,440
this is the third option

593
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,150
so mom

594
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,650
how this works exactly well this part

595
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,740
is not used you should choose to

596
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,819
to use random password

597
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,680
as a master password for your Michael
kitchen and this part

598
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,330
shown in red we won't be used and the
whole diagram will look only like this

599
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:25,330
so school proxy is not used to know and
the

600
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,900
probably random security call

601
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,360
is safe somewhere in the device will for
the west to be able to sync

602
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,780
must be able to complete the key must be
able to somehow

603
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,450
on store the is that the random key

604
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,939
you the random password or the the

605
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,530
option key so but actually I haven't
verified these

606
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,390
what's my guess is that this towing
something and that might be

607
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,940
extracted on

608
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,990
so the last one these to not use cuticle

609
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,359
and this is very interesting on
unfortunately I don't know how old

610
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,060
what I Campbell what I can tell you
about this

611
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,330
is that it's not using a school proxy

612
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,220
it is using think you will you service
I'm

613
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,520
sort of it looks like it maintains

614
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,990
some sort of form directory for all your
devices

615
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,560
and they somehow communicate with each
other through the Service

616
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,920
both I'm not really sure how it works

617
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,320
so on apple claims that in this

618
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,609
that in this case nothing nope all sorts
of horrible

619
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:44,950
to like well kitchen so far this seems
to be the case

620
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,100
so it looks like devices are changing
cheese through the

621
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,279
Q value service but actual password
exchange

622
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,380
happens through push russia messages or
something

623
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,830
and now this is work in progress maybe
when I have more time I will figure on

624
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,500
how it works

625
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,940
so that's pretty much it long

626
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,960
conclusions for today

627
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,540
are pretty much as usual trust you
wonder what we find the claims

628
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,990
even vendors Apple

629
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,618
never ever use simple like well secured

630
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:23,330
do not think that as a mess that you
receive as a part of Michael keychain

631
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,609
don's has something has anything to do
with 242

632
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:30,630
issue it's not its for some other real

633
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:36,660
much you exactly for which one and yet I
can say that like low key chain is

634
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,210
reasonably well engineered

635
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,210
mmm although different his shortcomings
why I sing this well

636
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,430
we've been looking at the system from
the point of view can Apple compromise

637
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,930
this well

638
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,890
definitely can and their own many
different ways people can access your

639
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,000
data but some think about

640
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,790
this from different perspective can an
outside

641
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,080
attacker on compromise these and

642
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,200
I will say that with respect to also

643
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,960
at attacker the system is reasonably
well engineered because

644
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,320
there are proper safeguards in place
securing

645
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,400
password is a for your choice of
political

646
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,430
for these stock and yup

647
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,230
the definitely doing rate-limiting and
occult local

648
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,260
call account looking if you try

649
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,140
tu brute force is a mess challenge or
I'll

650
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,330
i close cuticle I have my account
blocked

651
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,660
for some time because all that I'll

652
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,810
during during I was better the SMS
challenges that you receive they were

653
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,670
four digits

654
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,440
on out there are six digits so rebels
constantly

655
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,950
adjusting so

656
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,460
yeah it's not perfect but its reasonably
well

657
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,980
I will say that's it thank you very much

658
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,040
have any questions I will be had
handsome

659
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,040
questions

660
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,430
the question is whether it's possible to

661
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,560
to mount an online attack yeah well

662
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,980
not just

663
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:56,980
second who

664
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,810
again

665
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:09,810
so back to this school

666
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,060
to to mount an online attack

667
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,320
you would probably focus on this

668
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,080
guy and to to do this you will basically

669
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,710
two things to be successful this is like
you will need to know if a lady

670
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,270
and the possible the user and

671
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,860
i close to tickle so let's assume that
you know up lady

672
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,660
and the possible because well just know

673
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,859
mom you need to brute force or somehow
recover the four digit PIN

674
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,280
well I would say that if you're not
Apple this is

675
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,510
real too difficult because trying

676
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,930
each p.m. requires you to run disrepute
and the server

677
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,549
and the server will basically throttle
you down after several attempts

678
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,130
and then after like 10 at them it will
just

679
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,360
love the count so

680
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,869
this is the safeguard and also you will
have to receive SMS Jones for each one

681
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:12,000
Richard M and if you just try to

682
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,619
sent fake SMS challenges

683
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:19,440
predating instead of proper so much
chillin just

684
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,800
you also get your account blocked so
well

685
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,119
the mechanisms the mechanism of

686
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,160
account looking is not clear home

687
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,730
but there are to sort of account local

688
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,180
the use of clock and hard work soft glow

689
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,879
happens pretty quickly how to log
happens

690
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,190
if you ignore the soft walk and continue
due to do what you're doing

691
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,450
like the normal to the phone will will
not

692
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,580
be well it will or the soft Lexington
will not allow you to

693
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,049
to do anything what if you for example
using some automated scripts

694
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,100
lemme in the north of cold than

695
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,310
the count will go Carlo can then of only
two reasons

696
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:10,310
thing

697
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,060
yeah the comment comment use that

698
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,810
this can prosecutors I'll service attack

699
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,380
yes this can probably the be the case so
it's fairly easy to

700
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,530
I'm to look

701
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,240
user's account but again these locos
only it's not the I call

702
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,450
the IPL account look it's only for these
political service so

703
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,779
user will not be able to on

704
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:48,780
to recover he like all key chain yes
this is true

705
00:44:56,489 --> 00:45:03,489
who

706
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,160
the question is the second question is a
about

707
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,319
certificates keeping

708
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,650
you you know this I'll you don't

709
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,470
well the communication between devices
and server

710
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:25,790
happens over HTTPS to intercept is to be
issue have to be

711
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,690
like you have to mountain man in the
middle attack so you

712
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:34,400
basically place no proxy server here for
this to be successful

713
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,910
you need to long you need the device to

714
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:43,230
Trost your proxy server the device
connects to the server

715
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:48,400
well actually connects the proxy and
device must verify that its talking to

716
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
proxy to server not to proxy

717
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,359
and so to achieve these

718
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,250
you generate any absolutely any
certificates you

719
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:03,140
see with to the to the device you in
person to the to your iPhone

720
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,440
you market distrusted and after that you
just so

721
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,940
conduct man in the middle what I'm
trying to say here that

722
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,680
this thing is not using certificate
being certificate been is the thing when

723
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,520
when the program which talks to the
server use hardcore the certificates and

724
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,220
this thing is not using it so it is easy
to

725
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,910
room in the middle this this able

726
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,060
is yep

727
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,359
sold

728
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,710
law it is not also it's not about some
this this is just a a setup for

729
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,070
for research purposes this is how what's
new traffic so it's not about

730
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,859
tricking somebody to like running man in
the middle against somebody

731
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,520
it's a some effect of running man
millions my own device just to figure

732
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,400
out what happens

733
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,560
because if the program if the phone for
example use

734
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,060
certificate pink for talking to these
this thing would be much much harder

735
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,119
because you have to

736
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,630
and unless you do want to do broken it's
almost impossible to do this

737
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,050
Reese this is this is

738
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:17,780
this good not must

739
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,170
know that this is basically how to sniff
how to figure out what happens with the

740
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:22,869
device not

741
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:26,700
how to attack somebody by using this
technique so

742
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,700
and rebels using making this pretty easy
to

743
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,779
grown happens because not being

744
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,060
I mean the the use paying for things
like App Store

745
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,930
and iTunes Store for what money related
services

746
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,410
they do both for all the services

747
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:50,410
most to the coast of opening more
questions

748
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:13,810
yup

749
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,410
absolutely this is this is a this is a
problem

750
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:24,410
and this is why it is in rat you can

751
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,710
you there is spinning there are ways
around it but

752
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:33,090
is just harder because you need to get
the binary

753
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,100
budget the checks

754
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,920
love boring stuff so actually

755
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,960
let the feeling well if you ask me from
Malik

756
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,610
secure to such a point a point of view

757
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,070
well Legaspi lick of certificate been is

758
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,670
always on the reports if you do like
application assessment

759
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,890
if replication is not doing between you
always

760
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,509
I'll put it in to report and say that
this is like high priority or medium

761
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,310
priority

762
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,870
high-risk or something depending on the
application what it is

763
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,220
it is always an issue and the there on
there are reasons not to do it

764
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,580
but I think for stuff like like this

765
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,210
they definitely should do it because
this is important

766
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:23,210
thank you very much

767
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,220
break
