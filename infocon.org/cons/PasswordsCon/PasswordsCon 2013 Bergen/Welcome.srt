that's on Las and the first thing I want
to do now

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,280
is to conduct a very small very simple
experiment

84
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,789
before we end up in the white stock with
moscow he will actually be talking about

I'm just going to hell small wheat
starch

87
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,620
experiment and

88
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,150
on

89
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,219
what I want you to do don't talk to you
label

90
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,220
use a pen

91
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,169
and I want you to write on a piece of
paper I want you to write down

92
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,310
I'm for my or a for female

93
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,680
or a for alien just getting

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,720
male or female that's the first quest

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,430
the EC when you're done but the second
thing I wanted to do

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,250
is to write down whole digit

97
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,270
pincode that you are absolutely sure you
can remember in a month

98
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,729
from now on four-digit pin

99
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,289
that you absolutely sure you can
remember in a month from now

100
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:45,750
so tossed

101
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,750
make around a four digit PIN essentially
a four digit PIN that you think you

102
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,360
can't

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,360
remember in a month from now on and the
last thing I want you to do

104
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,359
is to make a sudden

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,590
digit and 7 digits that you are really
really show you can remember

106
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,489
in like a month from our assume issued
on that's

107
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,349
I will collect all the papers from you

108
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,479
and while you finish mock you can come
down and prepare for

109
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,050
bring us for stock
