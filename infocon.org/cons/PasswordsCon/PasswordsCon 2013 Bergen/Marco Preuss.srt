1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,910
up

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,710
things I'll

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,020
hello um

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,919
a bit confused it's a that too early
it's the

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,290
forty-five minutes million and the plan
or

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,560
has been tank and was later

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,620
at I can

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,739
I yeah I'm Marco I

9
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,089
heading the European research team for
Kaspersky

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:52,470
a on ultimate talkin vs

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,690
arm already had some talks with para

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,379
and thought of new things which were not

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,840
really covered yet with passwords I mean

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,270
a mostly people think world there car
loans

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,869
whatever now are thinking okay in
there's a lot

16
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,259
more out there people should care about

17
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,280
ion criminals are

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,090
and not just want to give you view from

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,380
my perspective from pop my daily life

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,829
what I see I want criminals in the room
with Mauer

21
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,369
are doing and yeah

22
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,819
that stuff for the first part I have
several ones

23
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,960
let's start with an easy one I'll with
the

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,889
mmm commonly use systems and the
Internet

25
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,939
CMS and

26
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,199
quite a lot of them I mean work presents
a lace means

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,869
Joomla I mean times love web sites in
the internet and remembers

28
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,439
the CMS and of course

29
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,439
maybe you know there are already a lot
of tools to include forcing attacks

30
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,790
on these on for example won't press

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,269
some this tool for example was used a

32
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,459
taking more than 25,000 work Press
utilities

33
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,540
by in fact machines so when those
machines got in fact the

34
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,090
and the the you didn't see it of course

35
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,600
this to together with the dictionary
wars

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,590
dropped on the Windows machine was
executed in the background

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,940
and they just had also a list of more
than 25,000 your

38
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,980
outs I hosted with what press

39
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,660
and tried to cast the arm Logan's

40
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,460
then there's WP paroled

41
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,100
hands pool sea mas brute force which is

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,210
also targeting more than just work
process and Drupal

43
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,370
also some small things and

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,990
these are used but and has of course not
on the criminals

45
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,830
and a lot of these tools also covered in
collected into

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,280
backtrack this is Linux distribution

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,550
for doing pen testing and securitised

48
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,690
I'm not just had a look and thought okay

49
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,690
they are these tools what kind of

50
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,880
dictionaries do they use I mean these
people

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,480
maybe there are some difference maybe
not I'll

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,709
they have a dark cold a list to you
dictionary

53
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,790
in the spectra distribution and of
course the famous

54
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,940
on well-known everybody has a truck you

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,440
of course and its just to check a bit

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,120
arm I wanted to see what's inside

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,810
Dakota list here and to be honest it's
not so good

58
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,580
I needed to remove a lot of duplicates
or from

59
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,700
1.7 million words

60
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,029
1.4 word unique and its crazy
combination of a lot of collections of

61
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,899
different wordless was a lot of

62
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,108
trash I I mean

63
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,638
even that this clay Morrow were all the
different dictionaries

64
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,860
will mention which were integrated into
this dictionary is

65
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,230
30 lines south side that a big block of

66
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,670
just crazy it's crazy stuff and went
just

67
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,710
having a look at the length of all these
passwords

68
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,770
it's clear that the common distribution
what you all have

69
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,030
and the common wordless you find out
there

70
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,929
and of course the char census also
mostly

71
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,470
a low of so it's nothing magic what
these people use here it's just a

72
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,080
regular

73
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,750
common stuff like just simple hitting in
the No in style

74
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,300
I which is not so

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,740
not so heavy or extreme

76
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,000
so when the further and in April this
year

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,160
there was a huge huge attack

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,910
targeting work Press sides are more than
90,000 were hacked

79
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,050
I and its halls

80
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,930
a bit depressed and checked for the

81
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,770
arm list all farm

82
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,560
user names and passwords which were used
or

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,350
gotten through this attack and later
right

84
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,389
also got my hands on another dictionary

85
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,680
used no life attack thought okay

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,419
maybe im the one saw the theoretical

87
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,240
pen testing once used let's have a look
at the real

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,770
lists people get or I use

89
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,049
so the WP password list

90
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,370
arm was quite interesting I mean

91
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,220
2,927 username password combinations

92
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,250
mean the first moment doesn't look so

93
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,090
incredible arm but in principle

94
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,909
in the air trapped on its twenty unique
user names which are used

95
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,310
and 1,259 unique passwords

96
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,120
and of course the most common I use the
name was at min

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,540
but also some other arm most strange
ones I mean

98
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm not sure who would its that Jessica
would be the second most use

99
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,100
work Press a happen lookin

100
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,480
him I mean this attack mother but
strange for me but

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,290
okay and when I had a look at the
passports

102
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,330
there or more different and the

103
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,510
theoretical dictionaries found in the
back track for example

104
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,050
I mean I was guessing something again I
want to Sri 45

105
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,160
whatever I mean that's the common stuff

106
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,770
but that the moles

107
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,250
frequently use password in there was
chaim

108
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,030
are 9760 okay

109
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,130
be sunny okay that's nice warm

110
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,469
I also funds some some very interesting
passports very long

111
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,470
I'll with the just complete domain name

112
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,860
adding a few special characters

113
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,080
arm so

114
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,109
that's an interesting dictionary I mean
from

115
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,449
more than 90,000 what price
installations

116
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,780
that's okay so there is definitely a
different

117
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,619
different different

118
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,949
wordless and dictionaries to we
criminals use

119
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,250
biondi's theoretical well spread its
well-known

120
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,590
password lists because there isn't huge
difference

121
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,599
um so we're sticking bits

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,979
further into that area of see mass
sackings and I mean

123
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,310
the first of the for yet just keep

124
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,229
common brute force tools but arm

125
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,088
those bit more than just two stools this
also

126
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,699
Mauer doing this in a very automatic way

127
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,109
on the wall for example this year the

128
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,540
what this cool botnet a more than

129
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,270
25,000 infected with most machines

130
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,810
an they compromise more than 60

131
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,589
doesn't web sites arm

132
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,620
also just buy brute forcing okay they
also got some some

133
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,730
dictionaries and its

134
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,760
and this attack are they also mostly
used the Atman use the name I

135
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,500
the now the Atman possible of course and
the

136
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,260
here the come numbers like
one-two-three-four

137
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,339
5 and stuff like that was T

138
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,649
mostly successful passwords in this of
course

139
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,190
so principal interesting

140
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,880
this book notes was successful was
stomach hurts

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,320
to come passwords you know

142
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,850
the others were a bit more on exhorting

143
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,820
so it's a pic be beat mixture

144
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,250
okay

145
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,680
coming to the more interesting stuff
after the entry

146
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,420
arm that's one thing I was talking this
picture

147
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,849
a that devices I mean every day we have
a lot of devices around us

148
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,779
supporting all alive supporting our
activities

149
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:17,080
and these devices are protected by

150
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,730
yes and a

151
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,130
you I would start with the am

152
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,939
most important to us for many of us

153
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,300
think a the device which connects us to
the internet and everybody who knows

154
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,270
South Park knows that this is the
picture of the Internet

155
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,130
a you and yeah I mean

156
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,350
I think most that you guys have this
kind of device the toll

157
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,660
and yeah but

158
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,230
I won't talk about more dictionaries and
this

159
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,290
a long part but we are talking about
Derek brute forcing

160
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,839
and its the first who

161
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,110
I it's us who

162
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,870
I was looking at it was think three
weeks ago

163
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,260
this one came out I am who also

164
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,700
Trojan targeting these boxes

165
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,930
dealing and that was

166
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,109
nothing too fancy and was a

167
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,940
compiled out with scripts outward as
some scripting language for Windows

168
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,370
where you can automatically lot of stuff
and you can also compile it so it just

169
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:35,880
have a

170
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,230
excusable this one was X was compiled
for

171
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,230
when those 64 and this was really not
using any dictionary at all it was just

172
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,180
yours screenshot of part of the sauce
called

173
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,410
at was just going from lanes one

174
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,880
till 10 with all the upper/lower case
and digital no special characters or

175
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,850
whatever

176
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,950
and the trust just iterating over

177
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,959
real things with all the different
combinations and tried to look in these

178
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,939
dealing to Wise's to somehow connect to
their

179
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,740
a system to be honest this one was

180
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,519
is not really %um that impressive

181
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,060
because and routine didn't

182
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,140
do anything where special I'm but it was
interesting to the these

183
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,319
kind of simple brute forcing over them

184
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,580
targeting just your ruder than twice

185
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,860
and I can

186
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,070
after that arm I look prozor and

187
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,860
we already have hi love these attacks
also on the pass

188
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,730
and its a this one is a bits

189
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,040
your arm war

190
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,069
an attacker tries to

191
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,480
access your router through your computer

192
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,660
by utilizing JavaScript

193
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,130
and in this case it was against tp-link

194
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,230
gratis and its

195
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,940
what the script us that a but so

196
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,700
screenshot of pot of the script stew pot

197
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,140
island here you see that a tries to
connect with

198
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,980
the I default username and password

199
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,810
I to the hopefully a

200
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,739
router and tries to drop a new

201
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,230
a extend the powerful for more

202
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,170
to change the DNS servers in order to do
man in the middle attacks

203
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,319
and I mean that's a very very

204
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,390
simple attack but for

205
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,180
also very interesting I mean who thinks
about thats

206
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,319
when you surf the internet that you may
be

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,620
a the the end she pawned off attacking
you on the router

208
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,790
an infected or change setting it

209
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,640
in the router with malicious way

210
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,290
and its I can

211
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,390
then I looked a bit further of course
and

212
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,899
also very in you this is lost as also

213
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,079
you weeks ago I from

214
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,969
another warm militias Colts

215
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,839
arm was a bit spreading so it's not that
highly spreading

216
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,399
its limits warm and this one is a bit
more on

217
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,269
no that's intelligent a it's not on the

218
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,290
focusing on one specific device

219
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,880
like to you once before the one on you
for dealing the other ones

220
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
or tp-link this woman's targeting

221
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,380
just a bunch of different devices and
the sites rather salsa set-top boxes

222
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,910
like what you have for your TV

223
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,390
and the VME a internet-connected
security cameras

224
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,439
also it doesn't matter which lemme

225
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,290
a which chipset these boxes run can

226
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,069
target differ in like arm apps PPC
platforms

227
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,130
Islands what does the tries to exploit
these devices with them

228
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,220
known one ability impeach p and

229
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,279
has a hard-coded list of also
credentials of course like the default

230
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,639
credentials for these kind of boxes

231
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,940
ands tries to authenticate with

232
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,079
that I mean

233
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,209
at just a few examples of what's going
on Hall

234
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:02,638
on out there and its

235
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,050
what stays at the ends

236
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,319
arm think about your devices

237
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,010
I mean million think about its this is
really a

238
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,240
good says to plug it in as suggested

239
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,500
and connect to the internet than that
not caring about it anymore

240
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,399
maybe people should think about long

241
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,579
changing the passwords 94 passwords

242
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:32,459
not thing in the city bus

243
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,489
I am

244
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,300
what s I mean rather's

245
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,699
and that's connected devices one thing

246
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I am but to be honest there is a bit
more in your network

247
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:55,329
what to these devices have in common

248
00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:02,060
what do they have in common but you see
here

249
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,619
at print this correct correct

250
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,729
but I mean something different

251
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,299
me they are all on the network

252
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,410
there are all winnable 2cv 2013

253
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,040
for 8 07 all different

254
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,688
devices of course there's no duplicate

255
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,770
but the what is this one ability

256
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,139
as very very very interesting one
ability

257
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,480
I am which says okay you can

258
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,140
use this URL just exchange the IP
address of course with the IP address of

259
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,460
the printer

260
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,100
irons you get this

261
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,980
when you put it into some browser to
this address

262
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,590
and yes you read it right there is
something about the HTTP password

263
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,959
and there's a long string

264
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,059
and its yeah that's the admin password

265
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,730
looks a bit encrypt it or is it

266
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,960
my no its not interested just

267
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,200
a hacks it's just long

268
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,760
plain text so this is the admin password
for the

269
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,690
printer and the

270
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,740
not so good and if you use

271
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,730
this Euro the Vipers enables

272
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,100
yet directly get it in plain text and I
mean that

273
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,520
yeah

274
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,120
yeah I mean that's good

275
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,719
I was serious me do you know what that's
yet this system where the presentation

276
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,720
good

277
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,660
yes

278
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,440
I am yet principal what I want show

279
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,299
these parts for that you have more
opinion that word

280
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,320
should think about and where possible
it's our very essential potom

281
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,120
with the with this

282
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,168
for example

283
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:37,150
small companies or mmm

284
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,500
has more than one man's a administrators
tend to use

285
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,210
the same password different locations

286
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,510
a and there is it's very likely that
this password may also be the

287
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,100
main domain administrator password or
something similar

288
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,530
so the small devices with this win
ability Mayo

289
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,760
mop your whole network to an attacker
just by exploiting

290
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,580
the printer and to be honest I i kno

291
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,199
attacks utilized were

292
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,960
done in this way like just attacking
different network device

293
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,770
getting into the intellectual property
company

294
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,340
and state and also grab the money of
course

295
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,220
arm but its

296
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,289
attacks are not always just

297
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,000
that they also some parts quite
interesting

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,809
you know where r consists expand your
horizon

299
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:45,700
and its this is something also what I do
from time to time of course

300
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,280
a hands they are

301
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,210
love of a mother the texts I mean talked
about CMS systems and whatever

302
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,640
and one essential services and the
Internet on most web services

303
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,460
of course SSH you know

304
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,750
a and there are also a lot of automatic
text targeting

305
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,610
SSH services and

306
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,918
just trying different username password
combinations in order to somehow get to

307
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:17,789
the machine

308
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:20,840
use it for other tax of course

309
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,459
a and I just have one not one but I'd
just use

310
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,720
this one I had a look at this

311
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,570
the server I have that some German ice
PE

312
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,700
runs for 18 months now and not just

313
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,240
checked it looks from time to time

314
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,990
for the SSH connections

315
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,210
and apart now that within the city month

316
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,120
I had more than 1,500 unique

317
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,418
unique attacker apiece so this means

318
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,740
more than 2 per day

319
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,289
and that right more than 4,600

320
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,039
tax within these range so this means
also roughly more than

321
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,730
8x per day are just trying to brute
force in somehow excess machine

322
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,600
and luckily I have some system to chose
provide and after

323
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,850
an amount of he is looking in San also
some other stuff

324
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,889
I and interestingly a

325
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,950
there were 30 common user names used

326
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,809
like rutin stuff like that and also more
than 430

327
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,059
totally unknown to me unknown user names

328
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,990
used in this so the chrominance also
arches

329
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,679
compile from time to time the successful
credentials

330
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,480
to their workers and just check it
against other

331
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,390
service on

332
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,070
so cause mostly was route used

333
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,280
on been issues so

334
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,860
people should be aware of this and if
you want to

335
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,530
that more insight into this arm

336
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,030
there were people who created some very
nice utilities

337
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,899
so-called honey pots on importers just
system

338
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,590
mostly faking star hands

339
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,270
a making it easy for you to trace these
kind of attacks and of course

340
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,280
which is more interesting

341
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,289
collect the username and password
combinations their use

342
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,650
which is interesting for you of course
to see what kind of passwords which

343
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:45,160
you shouldn't use of course maybe you
shouldn't use personal data or but use

344
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,990
public keys

345
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,160
but anyway I

346
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,610
and the very interesting

347
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,649
the keep on imports it's also

348
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,710
open source of course I as also

349
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,159
to India locks who way

350
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,190
so you can completely replay what the

351
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,250
people do when they have for example

352
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,720
success to look into your box so you can
really watch

353
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,730
what the attacker is doing on the system
love

354
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,490
way so it's just wanted to show you this
because a fun it's

355
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,840
hilarious a and

356
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,879
yet and everyone to look at some

357
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,140
bigger lists of passports collected in
this way from this kind of

358
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,169
honeypots there are some there's

359
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:43,059
the hive US in use Australia

360
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:47,940
which Ron large installation of SSH on
the parts

361
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,010
and publishing on the

362
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,379
username passwords cover nations use on
their

363
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,840
sage past works purses so quite interest

364
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,740
if you're interested in this kind of
thing and also want to have a look at

365
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,870
you

366
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,168
arm really use

367
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:13,380
dictionaries from the criminals have a
look at the sports

368
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,250
and its after all that's

369
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:22,880
on this some can often I'd era hats

370
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,980
out to be a bit more creative of course

371
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,860
I this the another

372
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,309
kind of attack going on every day

373
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,039
you know it's spam

374
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:44,110
I think most people have you know what
it is know it

375
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,610
it's like when you open your mail box
and you get a bunch of

376
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,840
cysts nonsense and stuff you're not
interested enough course

377
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,668
and lately it's just for thinking about
me

378
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,890
why should that the lead all the spam s

379
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,340
principle it's quite interesting I mean
I have now

380
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,959
use collections I have some folders and
not just move for the spam there

381
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,950
for later when I have some idea like
this poem it here

382
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,960
and what I did not just exported all the
spam mails

383
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,929
just just a few of them from one account

384
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,710
arm pastor split it removes unwanted

385
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,789
characters unified it handcuffs

386
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,150
had its some yeah it was an

387
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,730
tried to create some kind of wordless
other these

388
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,970
stuff because means permits you have lot
of different languages lot of different

389
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,070
can suffer its awesomeness typed words

390
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,889
which is quite interesting

391
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,130
another some some test of course

392
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,030
what can you test against credit this
word list and thought okay let's

393
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,899
check howard's arm

394
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,299
functioning when you compare to rock you

395
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,820
and my Liz was more than

396
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,820
20 the hi 28 megabyte spam mails

397
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,580
compiled to work list of the size
smaller than 3.3 million

398
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,549
unique I'll were

399
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:29,090
which is but more than 23 percent of the
rock you

400
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,010
yeah and when comparing these

401
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,870
both I I came to 31

402
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,080
milieu 32 thousands

403
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,090
all matches so similar things between
rock you and his fam

404
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,830
swatches mean compared to Rocky chance

405
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,399
order to pursue sands some knots

406
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,500
that much arm but

407
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,830
principal from my perspective as a proof
of concept quite interesting and I think

408
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,189
that will follow

409
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,490
this a bit more to see it maybe up

410
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,620
combinations from whose sentences and
stuff like that

411
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,080
may be interesting because its stuff
that's content you get every day

412
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,309
me everybody gets it somehow

413
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:22,620
a which maybe not only the

414
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,110
time-wasting but also maybe we can use
it somehow

415
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,350
for this kind of

416
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,289
fun things like this

417
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:39,090
and last but not least

418
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,158
this will be the next move my last light

419
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,130
which sells just funny thing I just want
to show everybody

420
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,350
sus lately I goes I went to some web
site it was llego

421
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,760
dot com and I thought okay let's echo
the registration

422
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,179
a I didn't write it

423
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:02,549
I didn't write that just put the
screenshot and added

424
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:08,230
she ran it says can go to Lakewood at
Carmines see this

425
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,620
very interesting advice a I'm not sure
if everybody a

426
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,469
anybody in this room would agree with
that

427
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,640
hopefully is not good

428
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,720
yeah and this way thanks them if you
have any further questions

429
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,720
since talk to every today evening

430
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,370
occurred the question was

431
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,870
a the if it's become easier to attack
web sites

432
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,699
principal all these kind of attacks
principally yes

433
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,060
the problem is that on

434
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,250
criminals its nots that kind of Matthew
what people

435
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,520
thought in the past its you have a lot
of

436
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,730
individual people I

437
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,510
and one specialize in one area like
creating

438
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,440
I'm at work creating a to creating
crypto creating a service whatever

439
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,890
and just exchanging and sharing this

440
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,830
for monies some do it for we whatever
and

441
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,659
these people just create with their
knowledge these tools and other people

442
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,290
who s

443
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:48,670
principal who have no knowledge can just
simply use these tools for doing attacks

444
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,140
yeah it's becoming very easy and that's
a big problem

445
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,790
what we have not only for attacking
websites but in principle for doing all

446
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,020
kinds of attacks like

447
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,200
to mention botnets today it's so easy
and

448
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,410
these interfaces for a completely having
control about

449
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,280
thousands hundreds of thousands of parts
infected machines

450
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,360
this is so easy and that's a big problem

451
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,800
because in this way you don't need to be
a very

452
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,480
deep technical person like these
whatever

453
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,280
hacker to pitchers can be an ordinary
person

454
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,730
go somewhere pay a few hundred bucks
thats

455
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:38,730
s

456
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,780
who up

457
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:51,780
all

458
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,720
up

459
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,080
I am at a

460
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,240
the question was what I think about the
Internet of Things because this is now

461
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,210
an ongoing

462
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,240
a topic and what we are doing in this
area

463
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,370
and yet this is a a very interesting
topic

464
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,479
I have lot of talks about this said Eve

465
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,780
Berlin got this very common topic like
are kind enough smart catches

466
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,960
your refrigerator and gets connected to
the Internet

467
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,310
your TV in your best you can to Thailand
in whatever

468
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,110
and I mean a principal were

469
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,139
I had these one example and the

470
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,320
the swarm targeting def different

471
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,720
kind of device like a set-top boxes with
fall in this category

472
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,630
and security webcam so course terrace

473
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,970
potential attacking these devices there
are also a lot of

474
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,200
sample so up completely different device

475
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,010
like medical devices now become
connected so are kind of daily devices

476
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,320
you don't think about

477
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,320
get connected to the Internet I

478
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,740
insulin poems palms for example

479
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,270
and stuff and I think it's a big
problems

480
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,190
really big problem people should think
about it and at the moment

481
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,340
of course we cannot do much like just
here's the software for it install it

482
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,240
because some most of these device cannot
install anything

483
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,000
I but of course we're also

484
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,679
following the trends and see what we can
do to protect

485
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,980
at the moment the best thing we can do
is education education education

486
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,540
education

487
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,920
make people aware of not on the consumer

488
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,670
important thing here but also defender
because most men

489
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,668
okay new technology lets bring about to
the market

490
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:11,830
security won't security warm

491
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,259
because it cost time and cost resources

492
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,210
time to market short to to be on the

493
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,820
on the edge to bring new technologies
you cast

494
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,520
up

495
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:35,520
I love these devices the smart TVs up

496
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,750
cars everything

497
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:46,750
minutes definitely am

498
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
yet

499
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,770
at the quest

500
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,860
any any three-peat for recording a

501
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,480
the question was

502
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,120
a and Printers & Scanners

503
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:29,870
are some kind of storage devices and if
it's possible

504
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,290
to access these kinda start supplies as
well

505
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,990
is printed or scanned documents whatever
our store

506
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,560
from the world and a

507
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,600
to the honest I A

508
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,860
dunno I

509
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,770
I haven't I don't know if there are any
vulnerability in this

510
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:55,780
so up

511
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,410
all up

512
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,910
of up

513
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:11,600
this all school

514
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,060
well school

515
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:24,060
yup

516
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,770
I

517
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:35,520
yet yes

518
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,520
up i cant

519
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:49,759
up

520
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,400
that

521
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,600
I you can you can oh yeah what's the
maximum damage

522
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,960
a the taking the Lego economy

523
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,960
several things a

524
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,540
one thing is that you and say you're
personal information

525
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,660
so it's clearly a privacy problem

526
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,970
and if it's going a bit further when you
do shopping for example when some or

527
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,890
store credit card information

528
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,569
and of course never never underestimate

529
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,290
the a regular user

530
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,380
he uses the same pass for at all

531
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,140
different services which are out there
and

532
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,560
this password it's the same as for the
gmail account and the Facebook account

533
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,690
and the whatever a car on the banking

534
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,400
on so I think the damages

535
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,400
could be throughout the acid

536
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:22,330
up

537
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,770
kept the question was

538
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,310
the distribution of ages how

539
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,830
principal were noble they are for using
the same passwords

540
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,240
I think we had some

541
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,540
didn't we are set some homes the past
about this column:

542
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,540
think

543
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,980
up

544
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,920
all up

545
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,920
all all I'm interest in profiling people

546
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:13,500
and a in to figure out if there are
differences between both pin codes

547
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,880
also passers poss racist used by

548
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,520
male-female a different age

549
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,480
of course different across different
boss languages such as an example

550
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,710
on we have seen loss about stuff already

551
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,250
depending on the cum service I think so
you're using you actually use that

552
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:31,880
password

553
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,480
this in some way resembles the service
you are using

554
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,750
age group is also interest up

555
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,460
I think somebody somewhere have some
data on doubts while

556
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:49,460
you need to look

557
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,279
yet hood

558
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,440
was a

559
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,440
the last year one or posit up

560
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,100
yep

561
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,759
yep

562
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,760
up

563
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:34,980
yeah

564
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,980
yes who will be

565
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,630
well and the day after

566
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,060
I'll method
