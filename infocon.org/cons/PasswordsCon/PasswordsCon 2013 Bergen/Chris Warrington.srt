00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,209
just well browser

178
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,529
his one haven't

179
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,680
K risen Happy this everyone read a
chapter

180
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,209
him see this is an

181
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,910
haven't spotted be easy on Sat yes

182
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,290
on hitting opted

183
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,849
noted paint

184
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,320
made our

185
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,089
cases at

186
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,100
so you there's a reason

187
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,060
that you'd his URL

188
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,239
inside where at dress of mine

189
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,510
not be

190
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,880
just you day

191
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,020
and yes we have to you power solutions
that

192
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,410
whatever sacrifice and other which

193
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,510
say feature

194
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:16,510
baumhauer op

195
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,980
you have a real out like not

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,550
few minutes my talk here

197
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,279
sorry about that nursery Stephen am

198
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,370
the actually that's the when I really
have to say have matured in

199
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,760
her hits a yet thanks for this

200
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,100
I'm I didn't wanna sniff K really really
deep into the details that I think it's

201
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,540
actually

202
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,620
is the former is the architect is much
more interesting than day

203
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,839
in turn out because we have weasel
country fine-tooth comb through the

204
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,209
scheme

205
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,189
stunt double checking that they're all
actually vulnerable to this type of

206
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,060
attack

207
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,319
and even though they all are I'm wildly
oh sorry

208
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,700
today -2

209
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,899
possible solutions and I'm new at this
for back pain isn't

210
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,459
say we maintain tibet ito and K if you
just happen to use a machine

211
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,109
say any questions and and thanks for
listening

212
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,380
well us us

213
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,269
house or I guess

214
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,180
as well questions or you think is

215
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,149
mmm I read it

216
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:36,490
initial yes this is you so

217
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,500
problems this hope

218
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,500
our saying you can still be

219
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,300
all saw

220
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,589
the res you all saying

221
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,330
its its okay its now is up

222
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,920
only also all that yep

223
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,199
all all

224
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,450
you said a.m. nice

225
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,990
row law I think

226
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,610
screw probably not the best example
because they've got a very bizarre uses

227
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,110
I'm by trip to construct some stuff
about the lower level

228
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,320
and this

229
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,890
there's a wonderful thing actually
there's an has a revocation practical

230
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,670
that abuses diffie-hellman in such a way
that the website has a secret which is

231
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,229
the

232
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,220
which house the secret in plain text
which is your revocation key

233
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,329
and which you can regenerate on your
device with them something kept of lime

234
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,519
sorry someone hacks alerts I am guess
possibly as they can then request

235
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,620
provocation

236
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,120
on everyone's account so there there are
lots and lots of problems

237
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,190
with such schemes their properties a
person's asking the swine

238
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,519
I don't wouldn't say I'm a massive
expert Norton a lot of them have

239
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,339
these implementations such a tryout and

240
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,209
one thing is how long does it take you T

241
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:10,000
and cezanne afsane how to teach pick up
to fame

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,290
scam a QR code application

243
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,469
select an account maybe he got a choice
and

244
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,810
and then for with the backend stuff
about to take a few seconds bet

245
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,689
you might be talking about 30 seconds
worth for education which is enough to

246
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,640
completely interrupt whatever talk to
actually trying to D

247
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,100
and yep

248
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,540
yes so it's the one other

249
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,649
the things that we we won to not do in
peter is to try me

250
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,910
had to reduce but I'm reduce that one
other thoughts is

251
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,910
I'm if I walk away from my machine with
PK

252
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,310
Desam Party Morsi break and we're not
the machine

253
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,849
but if I come back within some certain
configurable about time

254
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,670
there's no reason why congress unlock
again am

255
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,920
ante up people done this kinda stuff
before and there are flaws like I will

256
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,459
pass the word my office and my computer
unlocked

257
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,879
I'm but trying to reduce the number of
times do you have to vindicate his

258
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,620
probably quite useful and also pushing
authentications out from

259
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,398
but ask a trustee he pees or start
something that happen to get help with

260
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:17,839
roots very destructive trashy getting
things done very irritating

261
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,289
was actually if you have to do it
between some sort of sup tasks is

262
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:22,689
actually more acceptable

263
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,350
I'm some research in the area as well

264
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:33,559
so in his rush to give you better off
month

265
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,009
min

266
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,590
and what's the usability schemes like
basically

267
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,869
well and using

268
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:50,869
you something to scan it is your
progress as happens type password

269
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,110
I think there's also a comment

270
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,330
there was a comment to make about and

271
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,830
as we contemplate on the user it is well
I need my password

272
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,470
across which one was it and how I got to
13 or 14

273
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,820
at has a show about cover does a gay and

274
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,490
where's this at least doesn't require to
recall anything and

275
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,110
well then again this end the whole
authentication something you

276
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,610
and Sony know somehow something you're
on it or something

277
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,070
the forgotten something you lost in
something you once were

278
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,418
and saying mmm

279
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,000
p.m. we had a and

280
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,760
instance custom something that I am I
see whose 15

281
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,990
percent the IT Helpdesk times taken up
with password resets

282
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,899
and but about 7 percent was taken out
with people from Harbor taken

283
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:54,309
like a.m. to actually cutting things say
there is a danger with this kinda thing

284
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:59,190
yet for getting a partner at well many
thanks one thing but if you need your

285
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,330
hot milf in case they're fantastic
everything

286
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,408
at home or on a bus an

287
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:08,640
yep

288
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,039
yes Chi

289
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,640
and when I see her book why not invest
in topeka

290
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,470
people vindication and if you got
parents as such with motivated

291
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,830
accounts where you hope to it

292
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,270
police economy stolen if you how

293
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,220
decent on locking mechanism already as
whiny

294
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,220
capstone least is that it can you
individuals

295
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,440
say

296
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,910
the advantage to using say and I trust
the device will see to it that is two

297
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,800
factor authentication

298
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:06,800
yeah it's it's not a similar concept to
they

299
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,030
and what effect does appear here to see
whether

300
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,000
we cashews about %um term any secret 22
and

301
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,440
does it still work we have at to have
reasonable assurance of security

302
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,050
for depending on how you want to define
its role model and

303
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,960
that you can break it if it's lost or
does he was not use for someone to steal

304
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,420
it

305
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,490
say yet the age not he/she

306
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,330
and and also you can talk about and how
competitors things I single sign-on

307
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,030
schemes

308
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,990
one nice thing about this kinda
quantities that which was at that party

309
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,700
is your device is not sitting out there
on a Sat somewhere

310
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,710
is the problem with the two factor
authentication it's there if you're

311
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,330
still saying

312
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,290
our shipper use a different password
everywhere you still have all the

313
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,129
sponsors terrorism

314
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,110
haven't solved that problem be right you
think this they're they're interesting

315
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,979
para central

316
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,240
attending a sec completely revolutionary
design and space but it's gonna try to

317
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,309
push the boundaries

318
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,370
what harm in taking could be where

319
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,989
up this in
