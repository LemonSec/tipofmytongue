link to you know find me goes up

30
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,009
rights I so this whole thing starts back
in the noughties

31
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,339
may impair was doing

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,430
well he was doing password

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,680
auditing for rather large company and I
was happening

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,430
him out with the analysis was about 2500

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,280
Active Directory gas he was analyzing he
attracts about

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,819
93 a for senator and

37
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,048
arm so this is a precursor to was going
late

38
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,720
later I have to explain the backs back
story here

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,640
up the used I think it was a fairly
standard password policy

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,510
minimum eight characters uppercase
lowercase digits

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,939
and for this

42
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:58,939
the speech the important thing is there
was a change every three months

43
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,959
speak up please I presume this was a
standard-setting

44
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,000
and I guess I don't know icarly recall

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,140
I but what's

46
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,149
what was interesting was that they had a
fairly substantial password

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,530
history available sort

48
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,859
with I was looking at these past
histories and and

49
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,989
I discovered these long sequences a
password the

50
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,909
look like this starting

51
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,260
well basically the same password

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,828
when with numbers change and I was again
and again and again and it was the same

53
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,819
thing and

54
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,429
o'hare so is the Lord of the Rings fan
on

55
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,510
but sometimes these chains were

56
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,470
Michael Bradley broken they were just
suddenly there was a pass for this

57
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,090
didn't follow this trend at all and I
was curious

58
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,060
as do why sorry

59
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,870
jazz you're from I might be yeah are
wall

60
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,849
the there was a lot of a my chances for

61
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,529
burgeoning other winter know there were
two apparent reasons

62
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,169
are for these changes a YS

63
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,400
rather obvious on

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,469
and anyone care to guess by the way

65
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,699
what was the reason the purchase
suddenly changing this radical

66
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:37,130
good and no that's not a radical change

67
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:43,650
might be not an answer said

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,989
I'm

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,120
football or it has been long of

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,300
holiday you he said pair

71
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,270
give them a chocolate that exactly what
happened

72
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,960
a well we sold yeah

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,799
and I'll I'm

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,450
because it turns out week we actually
recognizes

75
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,310
whenever they're people forget their
past where they would call help desk and

76
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,080
helped us with

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,800
reset the password to super predictable
password

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,010
and that's how we respond to that now
there's a second thing that was going on

79
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,250
which I would

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,880
like to I think I read just called
circular house for changes

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,820
and a since anecdotal evidence is the
best on evidence

82
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,169
like pair to related a story about this

83
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,690
up

84
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,700

113
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,900
all life %uh that's

114
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,900
here you'll well

115
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,859
ago us or back so I was the second

116
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,659
second main reason for sequences

117
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:57,310
of course all the other ones are valid
as well you change your girlfriend or

118
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,949
your dog dies in the mirror

119
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,300
a well

120
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,710
are oh yeah I was told by someone I

121
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,289
previous countrymen it was Marcus you
needed quotes

122
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:15,409
in a presentation for to be valid as I
found on here that might

123
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:20,479
actually match you you guys have
probably heard this

124
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,400
before you probably have never heard
that name before

125
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,500
but is actually the guy the road in a
book

126
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,009
they went by then George really but you
can imagine

127
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,360
I think he liked imagine having book
signings with that name

128
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,099
and the you get through maybe three
books before lunch

129
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,319
well anyway this doesn't really work
with password is because it's the

130
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,910
opposite

131
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,630
if you remember the past you will repeat
it

132
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,270
because you great impassable looks
almost identical

133
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,560
so yeah the other item I need to

134
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,729
include in the presentation was kittens
so it has on

135
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,189
when I'm missing stuff here

136
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:14,189
a don't work

137
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:21,730
now

138
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:32,449
that doesn't mean anything to do with
drummer remembered

139
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,709
it's the path of least resistance I
think

140
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,670
so anyway as I was looking at this II I
I kept wondering

141
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,740
is there a way to measure the quality
I'll

142
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,600
password history a so this is just

143
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,209
a you know thought stage at that point

144
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,560
so I decided maybe I should try to
calculate the difference between each

145
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,229
generation passwords and

146
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,390
I would like to about that and

147
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,630
maybe the average dis difference would
be a good measurement for

148
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,110
for for this

149
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,189
so that's about as far as I thought
because I'm lazy

150
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,530
like everybody else and I went and
implemented as I looked around for

151
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,670
for I kinda algorithm for this and abuse
Levenstein

152
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,360
distance metrics which is like it is a
is an

153
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,959
nearly fifty or year old algorithm
invented by a guy called

154
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,229
blood in your the ensign it basin
calculates the minimum number

155
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,280
%uh single character added operations

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,540
that you need the to change or transform
one string into another

157
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,010
the operations are INSERT DELETE and
substitute

158
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,640
a so

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,430
I tried this implement it was a fairly
interesting baskin's it's a

160
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,560
it's a nice little outward is it's based
computer science 101 so

161
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,890
as it's been a while since houses I did
that so it's nice to

162
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,089
go back to the roots the so I

163
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,290
I had a look at the various now

164
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,480
the various password I found and back to
our Star Trek fan

165
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,920
the difference between obi-wan awaits
and 09

166
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,449
is just one single substitution

167
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:23,810
the difference between 09 and 10 is
actually to

168
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,810
substitution you have to substitute
0-for-1 9 per 0

169
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,920
and then on to 11 that's another

170
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,929
single substitution and just for good
measure has had looks if you

171
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,790
substitute a lot more replace subsidy

172
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,459
I don't know it's a big matrix or what
it does so it's it finds the shorts path

173
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,869
thats no a distance have nine editing
this the same as markers

174
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,179
talking about right other

175
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:56,790
so the average distance turn out to be
just over one

176
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:02,020
on are mainly because at this thing here

177
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,220
in because going from oh nine to 10

178
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,760
perhaps be dozens to said one

179
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,829
now so okay I thought but

180
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:15,380
this there might be mmm more interesting
ways to

181
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,959
joke you know this site so I thought
about it a bit more

182
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,979
om and I figure that well maybe I should
try to county is a

183
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,760
the difference patterns instead of
passwords

184
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,959
so I did basically what they're doing
and

185
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,059
hashed out in the other tracking after
they make you know

186
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,219
patterns for for hybrid hikes

187
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,350
so I transformed all uppercase
characters the

188
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,630
do it up because you largest now

189
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,140
digits an special characters to s

190
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,449
and this is how you can predict the
future

191
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,309
cuz what happened then is that om

192
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:03,650
only 108 became that pattern I can read
it is on silly

193
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,939
are 09 became that

194
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:11,599
10 became that 11-game that

195
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,329
and the average Palin's distances 0

196
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:20,199
which means that for patterns this user
is using exactly the same pattern for

197
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,719
every password arm

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,650
incidentally this is the this was the
third most popular Palin

199
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,970
overpasses in this on it the most power
popular one had

200
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,480
an extra couple bands at the end some
assuming that was the

201
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,679
year with Ford

202
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,939
alright arm

203
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:48,919
let's do some jumping to conclusions
here this is my favorite sport

204
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,929
this parents are uses responses to
password policies

205
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:55,579
clearly I mean now users are bloody lazy

206
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,790
they'll find the easiest way just path
of least resistance

207
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,689
they've the minimum effort they can do
to

208
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,120
to create a pattern that is hers to the
policy and they'll

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,220
for use it and use it in a user uses the
changes

210
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,799
little as possible each time you'll see
in this is no surprise right

211
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,329
are and this leads obviously to

212
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:22,569
very predictable sequence this

213
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,969
he cracked a single password you can
pretty much

214
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,140
guess all future passers unless they
break up with a girlfriend or they

215
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,160
forget the password

216
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,980
are really was it seem that they forgot
the original sequence

217
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,089
headed reset and then fell back into the
original

218
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,880
'em so yeah so I was thinking this

219
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,290
this is a bit silly weekend we can't do
this

220
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,599
this is just the what is the point of
having passed for security if this if

221
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,740
it's that easy to predict

222
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,870
so I tried fix it I try to find a way to
to improve this

223
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,959
up the question then is how to actually
prevent user from forming patterns based

224
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,880
on the policy

225
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,309
a is there anything we can do and i was
thinkin thinking house

226
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,419
and then suddenly I don't know when but
at some point I

227
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:17,410
there was this one is eureka moments

228
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,969
changeable see everybody time in

229
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,750
and is quite obvious that this is house

230
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,220
has to be done so I'm gonna deter a bit
into

231
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,880
a into the were the cartoons for a bit

232
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,620
you probably always already saying this
I mean

233
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,910
this is old stuff this is 1998 its
fifteen years ago

234
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,579
this password policy is nothing compared
to work using today

235
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,750
correct

236
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,329
well we squeal like a pig users will be

237
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:58,390
cheering if we had %uh this simple
possibles

238
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,839
so fast forward about seven years

239
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,179
this shows up now I was missing
something

240
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:12,169
Knauer an hour more closer to what we
are actually using today

241
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:17,079
I am we do we're doing doodles

242
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,719
Android business pattern thing that's
due

243
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,390
basically sign language I don't know as
a

244
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,410
we doing that kinetics passwords maybe
gonna

245
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,030
lead this from sup

246
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,939
it's a stretch okay let's go realizes
that's clearly voice recognition right

247
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:42,579
so sorry here but with

248
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,260
this is just simplistic stuff compared
to what I

249
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,860
think is necessary so is business going
to be in New World Order

250
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,929
we're going to generate a new password
policy on every password change

251
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,520
on so this means

252
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,799
we need to I'll generate we need to have
a cell rules

253
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,449
on how these generate how these
individual policies are to be generated

254
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,980
so there has to be like a policia about
the policies or a

255
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,970
a mess policy the so

256
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,289
enter the matter pass for medical see
which is

257
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:26,160
basically a blog post I wrote three
years ago

258
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,580
back then it was just thinking out loud
I've got a bit further this time

259
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,199
so to explain the matter policy the way
I envisioned it could be done

260
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,380
differently

261
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,960
but you know this is one one approach I

262
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,130
set up to carries a rules

263
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:51,070
one category is and are the non-volatile
rules there are the rules that affects

264
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,450
their

265
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,500
always going to be in the generated
policy

266
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,620
and their is something you will set

267
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,729
on at I very any apps trying to
implement this

268
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,270
than to have the both our rules these
are customized

269
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,918
for each individual policy

270
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,110
so here some examples %uh non-volatile

271
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,219
I'll the new general policy must deviate
from the previously generally

272
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,150
policy on at least three points okay

273
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,850
that means we have to store this policy
for each time

274
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,850
user changes password thats that's
doable

275
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,850
it's impractical but sure we can do that
arm

276
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,928
the other thing is that I think most
everything

277
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,870
agree that most passwords suck anyway

278
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,500
so it's just rejects I

279
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,419
why seventy-three percent init I just
picked

280
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:58,840
mom you can probably a price that number
more closely with some statistics

281
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,668
but then you would have to actually
implement a password

282
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,330
quality metric which as far as I know

283
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,590
nobody is done properly

284
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,010
there are billion different tense

285
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,120
none of them work probably think so arm

286
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,189
right cars

287
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,470
just you wait yeah

288
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,350
so I'm also each now the ball is I'll

289
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,990
policy rules well as a 73 percent chance

290
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,700
be included so sometimes there's a min
and password sometimes there won't be a

291
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,270
minute

292
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,668
on time in length et cetera

293
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,390
a.m. there could be other rules this is
just

294
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,450
you know we continue our discussion
later so the balls are rules

295
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,520
the which are serve the

296
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
the interesting part so the possibles in
and keep in mind I'm just talking about

297
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,010
a single policy

298
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,908
for a single user for a single pass for
change

299
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,850
now minimum personal lines

300
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,860
randomly chosen between one and 73
someone pointed out that well I would

301
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,560
love a password

302
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,610
that had a minimum length of up one
character

303
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,810
well that's going to be addressed as
well

304
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:23,649
duties at the Max or password length why
you would do that I don't know

305
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,910
pictures its not necessarily going to be
included in any way so

306
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,310
yeah next on I'll password must or

307
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,480
maybe must not contain a projector

308
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,570
characters the same thing with lower
case

309
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,169
digits and special characters

310
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,890
now keep in mind that

311
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,050
only 73 percent of these are going to be
included or other

312
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,810
there's only a 73 percent chance that
each one of these are going to be

313
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,020
included in any given

314
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,310
policy so it's gone Chen around a bit

315
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,740
I continued arm well as another
suggestion

316
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,980
some percentage balls I mean obviously I
I was only thinkin

317
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,230
the Western languages where you have
balls and

318
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,470
I don't know what you got in Chinese

319
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,650
won't but no I wasn't I have no idea why
I ended up with 73 but 75 was too

320
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,750
obvious

321
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,160
incidently I was born in 75

322
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,320
yep a.m. while

323
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,490
and the opposite password must contain
at least this as integer constants

324
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,960
on well okay so already now if you're
paying close attention which I hope you

325
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,870
are you can spot

326
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,870
a little niggle what if that random
number turns out to be 51 and 51

327
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,379
tough luck you won't be changed the
password

328
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,370
well actually reaches regenerate
generate a new

329
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,870
we didn't generate a new password policy
or we could

330
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,929
implement code that makes sure these
paradoxes or

331
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,290
are mutually exclusive rules don't occur

332
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,240
the right another on

333
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,290
and different characters so even if you
have a minimum length and one

334
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,590
if this room kitchen as 18 then
obviously the minimum length is going to

335
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,770
be a team anyway

336
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,100
are yeah

337
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,240
right is one that this is a simple
version on it

338
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,380
it must not much are word

339
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,410
or words found in and some kinda
dictionary which you predefined

340
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,830
your list addition issue that one look
into that

341
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,970
it might be you know rock you passwords
might be

342
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,970
a Oxford

343
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,280
unabridged something which but make

344
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,800
re tough okay am

345
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,470
also if you have other you other kinds
of information I mean

346
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,660
if if you all you have is just

347
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,420
you going to do change the password and
the these are rules that work but if you

348
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,620
have more information about user like
user name

349
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,550
you know the password history you know
the username email address you can of

350
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,860
course reference this

351
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,659
and create rules that that

352
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,309
well based off a bomb II have no idea
what age would be with you

353
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,790
real name other personal information you
can do you sound a similar phone

354
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,470
matching

355
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll words that sound like other words

356
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,680
are not allowed no sounds this pastor
sounds like previous password

357
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,440
she talked about you talk the password

358
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Janice you talk about passwords that
sounded like others or

359
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,350
right to this prevents that are you can
use rhyming dictionary is

360
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,850
around you can reference world events
you are not allowed to have

361
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,770
a password that contains ukraine

362
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,879
Thailand here that kinda stuff

363
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,550
these are just you know thoughts and
ideas of a mistake there's

364
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,419
stock in this house a I'm running out of
ideas here

365
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,550
these are things that can can base these
rules of

366
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,680
okay so you think this is ridiculous
right

367
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,760
well I prefer concert here and is going
to be a bit of those

368
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,530
a bit %uh audience participation I think
and let's see if we can actually

369
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,230
make this work in some way

370
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,000
are you basing this most of its

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,340
its do

372
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,590
he home alright

373
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,780
so you're seeing here is an example over

374
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,629
this is an example a a policy its policy
has an idea

375
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,110
and just for reference I guess

376
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,110
I am what you're looking at now

377
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,590
is one password policy and its

378
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,679
its up it what I'm doing is checking a
blank password so

379
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,490
there so obviously password must have a
maximum I'm for

380
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,559
63 characters that's that works provide
pressure

381
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,680
but a minimum like this 53 I am

382
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,180
not and I'll are cast on season we don't
have any characters are all

383
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,970
numbers and balls 21 per cent counts and
should be doable

384
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,350
forty different actors he well

385
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,889
okay so not lower case

386
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,550
are second

387
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,500
all that easy let's just start typing
what up but

388
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,690
I i dial blood testing this and what I
found works best is just mashing the

389
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,580
keyword

390
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,639
see what happens the

391
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,440
yeah attack pretty

392
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,300
im I think cats work better

393
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,570
they don't destroy the keyword I as if
you can do this

394
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,250
arcade 53 character the Hindu thats the
no

395
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,570
lower case so we can will things like
this

396
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:27,570
must contain digits a 40 different
characters

397
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,770
mom and second offer yeah

398
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,260
are just rude X thirty-three percent up

399
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,260
we have more is there anything else we
can answer

400
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,490
i jus should

401
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,820
up are you can fix up

402
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,270
ok area

403
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,740
so I am up for delivery geysers

404
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,030
his meh now we can start

405
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,530
typing good idea her you

406
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,230
well

407
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,920
an I should probably do this oh there
you are

408
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:25,920
I was your impression

409
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:33,050
gotta what

410
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,690
was back you

411
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,710
Korea now fitted

412
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,840
who said anything about memorizing about

413
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,439
you read by us so well

414
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,220
that memorizing the password isn't
really my

415
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,180
my something I've considered here a

416
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,070
mainly because there are password
managers the main thing I wanted to

417
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,889
avoid was

418
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,170
predictability a password so if we

419
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,690
going generate a new password policy
let's see what happens

420
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,780
to this one so this is a new password
policy

421
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,340
it's only the minimum life has changed
maximum length change

422
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,230
a now it has again Taylor case and over

423
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,420
I it must not contain special characters
are you have to remove these

424
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,250
mmm of

425
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,690
and I must not much words found in the
Rocky password list was the most popular

426
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,040
iraqi 123 456

427
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,399
well see

428
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,839
that's actually there

429
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,999
home well I noticed

430
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:50,440
12 is not a password in want

431
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,659
I

432
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,559
I

433
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:05,668
well is I

434
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:10,759
wells RAM need nineteen tags are some
teams are going to the party's old

435
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,369
sorry on 119 right must to not kiss the

436
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:18,708
19 purse problems and concerns so

437
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:25,259
but

438
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,659
order and I need to do this

439
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,279
the law so

440
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,339
even if so even if this

441
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:38,999
this seems impossible it is actually
possibly passwords

442
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:42,799
match this you will need the live
feedback

443
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,029
otherwise urs lost on

444
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:50,389
as is yeah of

445
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:53,769
year paint

446
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,029
sure now

447
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:01,639
you make a password manager generate
sequences

448
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:05,708
well I want to avoid I is this it is bad
for

449
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:09,429
not

450
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:14,809
I'm ignore the human aspect is this
something you would crack

451
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:20,469
with you run this through our to

452
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:24,789
bus its long here this

453
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:31,789
okay sir

454
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,408
so it appears that I've I managed two
things one thing is

455
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:46,979
actually three things the first thing is
to avoid patterns

456
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:52,119
usually are no longer able to create
predictable pattern second one is no

457
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,449
I all this this all depends on how you
set up your medical

458
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,190
of course but it appears that is very
easy to achieve

459
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,589
passwords that are very hard to guess
and the third thing I've managed to do

460
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,190
is alienate my users

461
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:12,579
severely but I'm hoping there'll be some
girl you know Stockholm Syndrome

462
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,719
thing going on here so after a while
diffused

463
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:19,469
alright to China long

464
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:23,679
are you get there I just

465
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,899
delete this one and as a No few rules
this time

466
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:35,899
any suggestions how to start

467
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:46,920
us

468
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,000
well will just continue with mister so
it's too short

469
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,930
did me a digit

470
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,410
six different him well that's just help
but twice

471
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,830
for lower there is racism

472
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,809
americanism I'd be

473
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,670
lost per

474
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,520
rising

475
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,510
in them

476
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,039
be whether

477
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:29,039
page I JK L okay as it is in past one

478
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,440
and no special factors need for that

479
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,610
only one digit you can remember

480
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,299
this is is it was the most filling in
your nap

481
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:46,100
II I

482
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,770
so party go back to the presentation

483
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:56,399
hey right so abuse them

484
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,879
this is the practical and approach to
anything

485
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,059
but this is unfortunately the way we
seem to be heading

486
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,450
less we find it difference method
handling

487
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,809
which circus nicely around you

488
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:18,210
peco or any other kind of password
manager

489
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,600
the things that pastors aren't bad their

490
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,168
cheese and if we just ignore the fact
that we need to remember them

491
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:31,100
we can generate passwords that are huge

492
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,850
and random and they would be great but

493
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,990
for the fact that we need to remember
them so that's about it

494
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,039
for me if anybody's interested in
actually implementing our

495
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,940
real version this I can surely help

496
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,789
but I don't think you make an
appointment questions

497
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:58,789
yes

498
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,010
on

499
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,230
Genesis failing to get my conversion is

500
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,800
well I don't have that much of a
conclusion

501
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,830
more it's more a you know writing on the
wall

502
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,569
thing the writing on the wall is that
this is where we're heading with

503
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,649
current password policy reviewed

504
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:29,649
I suggesting work like heck to find
different solution first

505
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,379
yes which is what I said if you have
been answered

506
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:42,379
and Russ yet

507
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:53,620
would you mind picking up a bit yeah

508
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,430
our your cat okay

509
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,690
so the question is is how how does it
work from usability

510
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,260
love you doesn't you should ignore it

511
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,930
but you do tend to get a bit

512
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,348
emotionally invested in the past year or
you're creating might actually be easier

513
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:22,760
to remember because you worked so hard

514
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,400
created yep good

515
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,400
yes up WAP

516
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,770
was related

517
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,170
us he said

518
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,490
up all

519
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,109
use also

520
00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:01,020
us or basis

521
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,390
much up

522
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,140
you saw said

523
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,170
no you need up all

524
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:23,170
up well up

525
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,859
aren't

526
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,230
hope law

527
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:36,660
should pops

528
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,578
lost house

529
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,900
made usual yes up

530
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,290
halls on is

531
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,920
also said

532
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,359
ass for map

533
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,390
you you

534
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,819
min

535
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:09,799
also mass up

536
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:14,400
where run

537
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,940
much

538
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,770
yep

539
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:30,770
people

540
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:41,670
now this will be the policy did

541
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,720
all for you up

542
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,720
he

543
00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:00,790
up

544
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,280
there was a question of here first

545
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:17,990
I'm sorry speaker please

546
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,868
did put into this know I did

547
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:29,869
or up

548
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,740
see is the problem is the password
managers are

549
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,270
are rather limited I mean you can say
the

550
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,990
food by is a including exclude yet maybe
you could you could maybe

551
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,919
managed yeah

552
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm said

553
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,910
than or percent while

554
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:04,910
up

555
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:13,289
I'll up

556
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:17,029
he

557
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:20,420
people use

558
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,119
soap

559
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:31,119
up in

560
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:39,539
anything

561
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,599
the question is how

562
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,160
how far away are we from Boise
recognition as a login or

563
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:54,160
indication method group

564
00:39:55,529 --> 00:40:02,529
way in the future

565
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,480
I

566
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,500
the technology is already here its

567
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,660
was not that expensive either is

568
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,750
but its yet

569
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,819
obviously has his phone its it's being
implemented as we speak

570
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:24,119
and on various platforms so secured

571
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,640
that's a different story that the most

572
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,009
I mean that the most practically secure
biometric is

573
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,869
what beam pattern recognition or
something the other ones are good

574
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:41,240
armistead I iris scanners is

575
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,549
low on their no

576
00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:50,329
you're correct and also the attack
vector would be trying to replicate

577
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:53,390
the vein pattern it would be attacking
the chain between

578
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,720
so it's largely irrelevant that's

579
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,680
matter now has the problem we don't
really have a good

580
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,288
the passwords right now maybe when

581
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:08,390
speakers down or good

582
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:15,390
yet up

583
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,078
I'm not saying happy

584
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:29,339
old I'm not saying that a multilingual
policies are the questions

585
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:33,279
a yeah always

586
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:36,359
said

587
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,660
law if you want to try out this
particular version

588
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:48,578
a later tonight if necessary yeah

589
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:55,420
not at all i mean

590
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,329
people memorize thousands of digits of
pi

591
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:03,819
or any other towns so there's gonna be
some what

592
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:08,308
people very special people here

593
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:13,210
a only know a they're not necessarily
Mensa members

594
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:20,009
they were biology call cell phones or
something them

595
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:23,130
Billiton she could probably love this
but the ability to

596
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,150
memorize stuff is not pulling IQ

597
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,710
right yet

598
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,569
crosstalk now my I'm done any other
cousins

599
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:38,119
%um

600
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,299
I use

601
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:45,480
companies that into them much good

602
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,980
I allow on good well you have a
different

603
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,619
a indications are obviously deploying
matter past policies as well

604
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:59,089
are you're talking about the termination
trust

605
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,730
thing where where the the box topper
something yeah

606
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,029
that'll be a nice another time no

607
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:10,410
the use pies

608
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,930
are yeah we've seen that we see

609
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,129
the din digits of pi

610
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,259
bull up

611
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:25,720
actually what this is anecdotal evidence
again but I've heard people

612
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,930
are just

613
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:33,598
moving out one step further into the the
small

614
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,700
for each hydration so that's predictable

615
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:44,700
up

616
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:51,460
me well I'll

617
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,960
me that's what they can remember yes
this it

618
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,690
there was a couple there are some a a

619
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,519
memory rules for remembering digits of
pi

620
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:07,629
years or something like that I guess

621
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:14,630
some other stuff 12:30 is there

622
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,200
yeah

623
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,210
we're pretty good at remembering years
four-digit years

624
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,570
because we don't remember the difference
remember

625
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:01,570
here so you can split it up like that

626
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,760
ca

627
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,020
and I can only remember on sixties

628
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,090
and wanna miss group

629
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,520
up
