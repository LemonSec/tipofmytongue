00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,550
so just quick about my

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,479
background the I just love a publication
security

20
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,490
the I might have been up and tester
since

21
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,679
penetration tester since 2008 the

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,720
that's why I begun to to

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,330
yeah interest me in that application
security our part programming background

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,070
the I'm going to use a

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,580
been a an example of LinkedIn Today

26
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,390
in my talk and that's not because I hate
them

27
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,670
I liked them the I've told them

28
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,600
they have a I have a problem I will show
you this problem

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,689
the maybe a lot of you have heard about
the sconce

30
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:11,280
problems before that at the end of my
talk I'm going to show you and you

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,629
to that we have made especially for you
now

32
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,179
it's a where you chew with a few issues

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,689
left to fix but yep we will show you

34
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,349
so I always have this morning

35
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,918
the this is for educational purposes
only

36
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,129
don't to this no know the other it you
know the drill

37
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:36,358
so a I

38
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,019
so after what what concerns me about

39
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,779
are security when I store my data

40
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:48,189
somewhere i'm concerned. whether Monday
to secure a lot of course

41
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,519
yes I love you think the same way that

42
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,279
I do i'm concerned. whether the website
that I use is safe

43
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:58,930
is a safe as necessary around the

44
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,870
the program that I will show you now is
a recurring problem so

45
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,079
that's why we do this on a underst

46
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,489
this once again so

47
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,749
the the thing is about what I'm going to
show you that

48
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:20,059
the you have a security available but
it's turned off by default

49
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:24,419
so the we have a lot of

50
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,439
and unencrypted networks around the
place with the

51
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,529
coffee places the airport

52
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,659
I'm not that's a lot of places II will
show you

53
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,679
what I in a demo what I am

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,269
quite excited to show you the

55
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,249
but we have to do a session sessions in
30 seconds because that's what it is

56
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:48,459
about so and you

57
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,400
make a request to our site for instance
link them

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,459
a you get a response back

59
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,109
the use under username and pass password
once and you get

60
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,989
cookie and the cookie will be set back
and forth

61
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,689
us the secret show that your
authenticated

62
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,290
so I have a question for you guys

63
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,900
how many of you type in

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,418
HTTP ask colon slash slash

65
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,880
www on sort that

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,530
how many of your yeah and I think

67
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,710
the the night majority of people using
princeton's link them

68
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,590
just rights link them dot com

69
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,869
press on right so

70
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,640
the is that important yes that some very

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,039
important different so at you have

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,450
authenticated the HTTP s

73
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,700
and you think okay that secure enough

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,969
for me the checked so

75
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,040
the username and password wasn't rips
off his

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,100
safe check so

77
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,130
know you traffic is safe no

78
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,190
so I i would like to

79
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,930
show you a an email that sounds too

80
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,030
this is actually the response the

81
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,030
hmm so at try to tell

82
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,179
you have a an issue the yes you have
HTTPS when you

83
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,160
login but afterwards the cookie goes in
the clear

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,530
so I'm able to snack chips and become

85
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,809
whoever I want so

86
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,890
the they shortly a.m.

87
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,340
they'd just told me that the okay

88
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,320
you went into the page BR link in the
comment not

89
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,810
HTTP ass colon slash slash

90
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,370
WW and so forth and so so it's my fault
so

91
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,640
they told me that what you should do is
go into this

92
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,700
link on the choose securities today

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,140
how the the security option

94
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,800
available for you but how many of you
guys have

95
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,020
went in there too check it

96
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,390
one 2345 that's good

97
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,880
so I just want to I i really like link
them but I i want to show you this

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,980
the just to understand it's quite an
important thing to

99
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,640
to try to get them to understands

100
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,289
use HDTVs by default

101
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,590
so this is just some pictures I've taken

102
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,109
the so you you can see the S appear

103
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,100
this is in the login form

104
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,590
and when I'm love them it's gone

105
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,760
so than the cookie go senator

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,060
so we have a of course a demo II

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,240
I think I'm going to show you

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,400
this in

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,400
film I watched

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:17,830
so here

111
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,320
like this up its quite small

112
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,390
we will run this the

113
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,380
movie and I'll used to time to explain
but

114
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,080
when we see in this mode adjust deleting
the

115
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,510
the cook is now just to show you in
Firefox this is Firefox that's the

116
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,830
attacker attackers browsers so

117
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,180
we're trying to get login and in Firefox

118
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,120
so I start Wireshark this is so fari

119
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,630
this is the victim under we are going to

120
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,090
login here now

121
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,090
the the Wireshark is a

122
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:11,090
sniffing the traffic I did something
wrong there

123
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,859
yes so now I'm looking in I'm

124
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,850
I and I on secure not work there is a
guy who sniffs the traffic with the

125
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,170
monitoring mall mode on is not work art

126
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,440
on here's he is logged in just a

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,490
see this link the

128
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,810
we get back to that so here's the
attacker so I just show you here

129
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:41,329
just pressing Enter that we're still not
login at

130
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,130
try to find Wireshark just two shut it
off

131
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,660
so and I save

132
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,660
to a file

133
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:04,309
say

134
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,889
and then I would like to see the results
of the scam

135
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,470
and it's a

136
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,709
combined binary on untaxed so

137
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,160
non just searching for link them

138
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,410
and a because also because of the
uppercase

139
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,259
al it didn't work but a lower case it
works on here is all information I need

140
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,679
to the because I'm a in this case myself
so

141
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,290
but the I would like to hack my cell
phone

142
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,618
not hurt anybody else so we need this

143
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:42,889
J session ID cookie

144
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,220
so now I just the

145
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,339
trying to build up cookies in the my

146
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,660
browser on the

147
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,569
this one other RIAT cookie

148
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:59,569
the that we have to input

149
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:03,790
and just say this is a session cookie
and then

150
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,309
I tried this link and put it

151
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:10,899
in in my attackers brosser

152
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,170
and I become the person whether

153
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,878
in this case myself so the question is a

154
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,309
is there an easier way to do this and
has anybody done this before

155
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,319
course they have so the

156
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:32,110
know I'm going to show you something

157
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:39,110
elsewhere going into the slights again

158
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,649
so the question is why don't

159
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,779
we use HTTP all the time the

160
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,240
because it's more resource hungry its
the

161
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,410
done normal HTTP you can on their

162
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,199
host a single the main per IP address
when using HTTPS

163
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,380
I know thats kinda far you have

164
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,680
something called servername indication
but this an extension for

165
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,160
as a cell that allows multiple the mains
on one

166
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,329
I P so it's quite I think

167
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,120
you can say that I'm not know problem
issue

168
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,510
the future it breaks name based

169
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,779
virtual hosting and that you will
probably want the homepage

170
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,189
accessible be a HTTP so that users don't
have to remember

171
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,130
the HCPs as I show you so

172
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,890
I think some of you thinks this is
getting old man

173
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,199
the this isa this is 50 ship

174
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,390
you have a supply ship that was
groundbreaking

175
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,459
was very impressive as you see here you
have

176
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,160
you have had almost three million
downloads that's quite impressive

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,380
for for on an extension for Firefox

178
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,240
the but it only worked with a certain

179
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
Russian of Firefox on you have

180
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,449
some issues they're not made it quite
hard to use

181
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:16,560
and you also need I wireless card that
come

182
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,219
sniff in promiscuous mode or monitor
mode so

183
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,880
you know in Ethernet everything is

184
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,329
shouted out number when you set the

185
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,709
the not work or card in monitor mode you
can

186
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,630
actually sniff all the traffic from
everybody in that

187
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,730
at work so

188
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,029
you also have a if our cheapest sex the

189
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,240
version zero-point one I really love

190
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,390
testing this to its was is was great a

191
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,000
anybody heard about five ships almost

192
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,670
everybody so it was quite cool you got
to

193
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,729
to actually just start it and you could

194
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,569
sniff to traffic and you can become
people

195
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,610
that serves for instance in facebook
that's not

196
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,260
the and a problem with Facebook anymore

197
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,500
and I think maybe that's because of
partially

198
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,750
actually because it was kind of
everybody could act everybody I'm

199
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,920
yeah maybe that's the solution

200
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,430
without so the

201
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,699
we now have a that's why we have called
it

202
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,490
it's the we have work to their might to
get

203
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,529
something to show you here today on the

204
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,040
we have a few issues Ahava

205
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,360
a movie

206
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,390
all that I can show you afterwards live
if you want to it's not a big

207
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,770
to yet so the reason why we

208
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,300
the continued building that spice

209
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,439
course this a lot of lot of

210
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,500
a companies that still uses HD

211
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,800
TPS when you log in so you have us

212
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,000
cookie and then they turned over to HTTP

213
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,130
much cheaper for them so

214
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,399
been the the cool thing

215
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,690
also as you have up Java Web Start so
it's a

216
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,410
beria EC to use you don't have to
install

217
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,390
the so we have to use a proxy here

218
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,279
here is today the the thing we working
on offer because you have to use a proxy

219
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,500
to set cookie to on

220
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,760
in Example LinkedIn's behof thats to
problem we

221
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,399
WEA I think we almost sold it now

222
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,550
so the and you will have to set up

223
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,959
a proxy ones mom on the

224
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,329
yeah it is the very easy to use and it's
just like partially

225
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:55,069
we have also I a couple of issues with
the

226
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,850
setting the the wireless network card

227
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,520
in promiscuous mode or monitor mode so
the

228
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,520
I will show you the quick demo of about

229
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,750
on the

230
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,829
Here I am log in so

231
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:30,189
this is the Oprah and we have

232
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,449
I a in love the session

233
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:36,979
and we will try to the catch

234
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,980
that cookie with web spy so

235
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,730
we are in opera

236
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:02,730
we are logged in just checking

237
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,750
and then we start this labs

238
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,410
by thing we just check

239
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,420
for in this case

240
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,260
hi use I

241
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,399
a mod which the captures everything

242
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,910
so when I push enter

243
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,279
again now it should have by touched the

244
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:39,279
cookie in the care here we go and a

245
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,830
for future releases we we a planning to

246
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,130
we are planning to

247
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,120
show only the for instance the first
three digits and password or something

248
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,200
just to scare people

249
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,200
a bit

250
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,980
so here I'm struggling kind of a

251
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,510
be the proxy house a it's not

252
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,730
a perfect proxy that we use

253
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,819
for this thing we're going to have to
fix that

254
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,169
so here on my proxy

255
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,089
I have to set local host here and listen
to

256
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,069
1337 of course lead port

257
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,159
and this is as I told you to

258
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,730
to be able to set the cookie on
LinkedIn's

259
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:44,730
the whole

260
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,770
and the bug the is

261
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,120
the I have to actually term of

262
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,870
the proxy again afterwards to make it
work and refresh the site

263
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,000
that we have to fix so

264
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,230
now just click the hijack in brosser

265
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,350
button and now

266
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,600
we have set

267
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,600
the cookie

268
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,659
and this is error message you saw I was
in

269
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,100
and them I was redirected to this
parasite and thats

270
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,270
the a proxy

271
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,680
it's a proxy problem so we have to fix
that so

272
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,600
when I just turn of the proxy and
refresh the site

273
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,860
I'm in so when we cam

274
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,600
get rid of these the issues you have
similar to

275
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,469
to pirate ship appointing click we can
have

276
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,590
of course touch this picture of this
lovely picture of this lovely person

277
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,669
down to take on you can pick up become
this person

278
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,900
on the yeah and so forth and so on and

279
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
so

280
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,620
the what do we do to to

281
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,750
the not be normal for this

282
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,450
clients of this kind of problem

283
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:25,450
so

284
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,409
I just want to tell you this is
developed by

285
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,700
a guy get hall on some from

286
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,130
our security its work in progress and if
people are interested

287
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,400
I guess it will get dawn sooner so

288
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,150
we are thinking about maybe a

289
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,710
make it an open source project we don't
know yet

290
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,440
so how do we how do we solve this

291
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,530
of course the Firesheep way is

292
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,840
anarchy just if you let anybody become a
hacker and compact and

293
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,010
anybody and of course to have to fix it
I think that's what happened with %uh

294
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,480
Facebook and Twitter but there's a lot
of

295
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,550
other sites lot of other sites a hospice

296
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:18,340
problem so you have to use all these
three

297
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,090
tissue of course you need to turn on the
SSL

298
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,179
the and you have to

299
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,330
at the these two kind of do that the
same thing but here you have Sat

300
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,970
us a jet session cookie you said HTTP
only

301
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,610
and secure to only you if you are

302
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,010
if the client tries to other Bros tries
to speak to the server

303
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,710
by HTTP the service s I hear you

304
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,820
but here we your only love HTTP

305
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,710
if you want to speak with me so you have
to turn on

306
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,940
a cell set the Secure Flight on cookie

307
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,270
and use strict transport security and HD

308
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,879
Heather then this is this is the
solution actually

309
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,740
so yeah I'm

310
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,400
a bit earlier to finish here the I will
take questions of course

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,400
and a very hot sunny yes

312
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,510
yeah

313
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,050
could you peace when markets if I he

314
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:44,050
yeah

315
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,309
we haven't done he he asked me if I am

316
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,590
person is Easter cookie

317
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,999
stored somewhere except your

318
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:04,269
too hard drive okay so

319
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:07,269
we're not a I haven't done any research
around it

320
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:11,129
but I think it's in memory on when the
other people

321
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,949
a the other person the a the victim
looks out your soul

322
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,379
logged out but you can do some damage in
in between I

323
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:23,459
also think this cookie loss for quite
