1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,230
thank you

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,039
so we totally about to fully a
compensable to tradition summer for less

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,619
than

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,250
hundred dollars so we can make yourself
it would be something like that

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,860
so it's pretty nice and and lethal a

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,860
which will just a few words with me

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,460
so I'm working in a company called Cisco
system the committee gets nicer

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,850
its in the French by Prof isn't a it's a
fifteen-years-old company

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,890
and we're doing security consulting
services and

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,210
customers development especially for
small Commons

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,249
and so its sorry and no

12
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:48,079
yeah I unfortunately woodruff

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,660
working with Anza we are looking for in
Linux and Windows

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,500
solutions were doing some OpenSSL
solutions also some close one

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,700
but to talk about the open source
solutions

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,000
I I'm the city or the company a

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,080
have a massive science and
communications systems and have been

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,730
asleep with

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,770
electronics that's why I like to to me
to beat computer science and electronics

20
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,679
so what is the schedule for today a
first we'll see

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,880
but you know already wavering your
password I never strong enough

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,960
butter I will show you some different so
hardware tools

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,210
that's a explain how why the security

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,929
the passwords and muscle secure so what
are the different solutions

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,430
for more security a we present the

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,530
we present with QTP are open source
solutions

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,290
a how to setup this device for less than
100 dollars

28
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,290
a live demo it's always cool to have a
life

29
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,440
with MUTV installed on this Raspberry Pi

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,429
and at the end some questions if you're
still alive a

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,259
so why regular password I'm never strong
enough you know

32
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,340
us yet same password is used for

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,370
a lot of different positions so I the
beginning you had your lawn

34
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,650
and after why use okay I have also my
email and perhaps you have facebook

35
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,380
twitter

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,660
a bunch of applications and the you
never know exactly you go on

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,290
lot of web sites and you you put all
with the same password because

38
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,590
who knows you broke for good 1 and you
never know if it's the Santa Claus on

39
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,299
the other side

40
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:25,290
or perhaps not so a on bad web sites
they can just see your password and

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,079
the record your password and after that
way his password at all the places

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,790
for example when you ask for email and
password

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,820
some a lot of people are using the email
a gmail

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,060
end up with the same password as Gmail
so if you're on the other side you just

45
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,730
can do

46
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,149
on Gmail and Logan account so and I will
show you

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,150
even if a lot of people are able to

48
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,180
take your arm your password on the
Internet

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,180
a it's also possible your company for
example

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,750
you know probably the risky loggers have
so here

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,390
keylogger more than one so you just put
that

52
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,089
between your computer and the ps2 keeper
and it will record

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,060
or your your keys so it's very easy you
put that in the computer

54
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,599
normally the first take the characters
will be the password to the BIOS

55
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,500
passwords perhaps

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,239
and up to you will have the Windows
passwords and after a week over the key

57
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,830
one week after and you have a lot of
interesting stuff on it you have also

58
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,860
camera into the camera you know you know
car key for example

59
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,020
you have a lead to come another is that
the weaker key but you can put there

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,660
somewhere

61
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,720
near this and after you can't see what
the

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,609
people are typing again this is basic
hardware tools

63
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,860
you have some nice a hundred tools so
for example you have the way less

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,940
keylogger so it's

65
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,220
even easier you can put once you're
killin response from

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,250
which is wifi enabled and you can say
every

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,550
the day at two o'clock you try to take
this to

68
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,129
access point and use and just what was
tight from the day before

69
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,440
so you don't need to be there physically
and you can for example go once a week

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,230
near the building with the your

71
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,280
portable access point and you can
recover

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,349
but different data that was typed so you
know and

73
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,950
know where your strong password is not
good you know you can have a source

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,829
some fake USB keyboard like this one
motor University

75
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,310
so for example it's like a memory stick
but inside

76
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,940
the Reza a cheap that make like

77
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,349
a keyboard smallest let what you you did
and so you can put some different

78
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,030
fewer and if the people didn't look at
the computer you guns

79
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,669
for example open Internet download a
virus or whatever

80
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,500
do what you want install systems the for
or something else

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,960
and a lot of people if you are giving a
memory key this okay

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,180
I have a conference on it and sit but OK
no problem

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,780
within in the computer and just
everything very quickly

84
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,609
so for if you don't look but your screen
you have no chance

85
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,580
because its very first usb2 Prince
universal some

86
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,810
all the tools like for example for
success mantra

87
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,530
and stuff like that so because

88
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,929
every release technology exists within
the def we have to have a more

89
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,279
security solution for your password so
what are the different solutions

90
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,130
for more security a we talk about
perfect addition you talked already

91
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,440
that a they'll use it for this
combination of knowledge

92
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,060
and position factors if that him she
because you have the physical at him

93
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,339
tired and we know and %uh you know your
personal p.m.

94
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,520
so you have two different things you
meet everything and

95
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,370
lets it you can access and take some
money we have also some

96
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,690
all the solutions for example with no so
for installation

97
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,610
you have a password list you know that
from resided or

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,770
now but a lot of banks were doing that
at the beginning you receive a password

99
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,260
least

100
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,820
and each time you love in you take the
next bus toward

101
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,800
you scratch it and the next one will be
we were for the next time

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,150
so this is pretty old but it works it
could be for example a backup for some

103
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,370
solution so you have a your paper
somewhere

104
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,950
and you have at least and bus was that
will work if you lose your key or

105
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,479
whatever a

106
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,740
okay how what's the password least so
you just put your username your regular

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,510
password

108
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,520
the mix coolest and the seller has a
list of all different

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,789
generated password or perhaps I should
be and the

110
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,860
and to look like that a

111
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,840
in the history can market leader for
some indication was

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,438
there is a

113
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,500
and they have their own time based up 22
nite only the second algorithm

114
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,539
and the they had seventy percent of the
market in 2003

115
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,020
knows that we need to be less and in
2013 they have

116
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,409
sold more than 25 million of device

117
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,930
you heard probably that the have been

118
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,240
they have leaked some database a

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,900
contents so people are not very happy
with solutions sometimes

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,900
a the first open source one-time
password solution that's the

121
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,529
I remember it was me mobile more by otep

122
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,560
in 2003 its the a commissioner for

123
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,090
hash with md5 and it's a mix of a pin
code

124
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,250
and the the time actually

125
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,449
going it's an open source with more than
forty implementation

126
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,410
and the the initial claims where the
Java j2me

127
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,509
see Lisa holds a Nokia

128
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,770
you know Kim that was not your phone's

129
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,830
and the all phones were working also
with these

130
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,150
there is a for another use for iPhones
use either

131
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,060
which iPhone is was only made in 2007 on
Android or whatever

132
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,940
so it's it's pretty nice butts its a new
purse was but not standardized

133
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,250
that's why it's not very used in the
love place

134
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,780
but we use that at the beginning you
have also

135
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,169
the now better password

136
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,568
things a 28 th minute in city for opened
with additional made a standout

137
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,520
and the first one which HTTP so each
witty P means

138
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,029
H Mac base one time password Gary and
with

139
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,990
lease the code completion is bathed on
hash function

140
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,889
and that you have a counter on the left
Anza

141
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,090
when you click on your counter so you
have a seat at the counter

142
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,869
and the password depends of the counter

143
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,469
and the special siege make for each for
each talkin

144
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:28,659
so the scene was beneath for each took
'em and each time

145
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:32,448
you process your a smack you will have a
new password so

146
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,620
how it works when the you arm connecting

147
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,709
on the server first said okay the last
bus will you have used

148
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,689
the country was worth 379 so you are the
user

149
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,949
you click on your talkin click and
perhaps you had to the

150
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,729
children in the pocket so it click three
times without logging

151
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,860
so we have three hundred 82 so

152
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,339
your you're talking these doing the
meats and the

153
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,790
your your PIN code is all the talk and
so is 754

154
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,990
08/01/12 to on the summer site

155
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,010
okay the server-side know that the last
one was

156
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,470
379 so he compute say the five next

157
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,560
so five window you can change the wheel
size so I can come to the 380 381

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,390
23 84 and a check which one was

159
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,420
if one is equal to the

160
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,140
the talking from the user which is the
case so the server say okay

161
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,240
up to now all the all the passwords are
used

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,370
and the next the way we will be the 3326

163
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,670
months so this is how the what HOTD
works

164
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,990
and this is standardized and so you can
certify you

165
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,310
certify with that and you are sure that
you have been to BT

166
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,369
between to conserve answers so the next

167
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,500
as I said that the next the trade tokens
will be

168
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,640
starting from 300 83 position

169
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,400
but it will be deleted complicated
because when you have the talkin

170
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,730
in the pocket sometimes you click too
many times on it or if you are there

171
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,290
never was

172
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,180
and after you are and synchronized and
when you try to connect again

173
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,530
you do not work because you you have a
to be

174
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,040
gap between your country on the counter

175
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,060
sober and you need to synchronize
everything and it takes a lot of time

176
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,319
so they also made in 2000 to

177
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,390
thousand ATS a time-based the

178
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,280
one-time password agree so it's based on
the same HTTP

179
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,949
a written but now the country or is a

180
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,000
is the time divided you thirty-seconds
orange sixty seconds you can choose its

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,990
own parameters

182
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,350
and the mean computing all the

183
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,150
talkin is still the same so you have the
time divide in 30 seconds

184
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,120
you have your seed which is unique part
of them and you make the least

185
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,760
could be the same if you have the same
see so how it works now on the server

186
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,340
okay it's quite cheap the issue a

187
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,620
it's time to have your your code sorry
just click on it

188
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,270
and you are in these thirty-seconds on
the server

189
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,670
the computer also need to be before I
need after because

190
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,819
nobody have three switches not everybody
has the switch was so sometimes you

191
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,960
you'll eat some

192
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,270
some minutes sup sir

193
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,060
a he tried different to a bit before it
to be after

194
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,510
you find the correct the talkin and and
the and

195
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,410
he can re synchronized because if he
said okay I think the tokens to

196
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,189
manipulate

197
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,870
I can I i kno thats the next time for
this user

198
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,340
I make plus two minutes so you can a

199
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,500
38 and synchronize the same time the
same

200
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,320
the windows in position can be set up to
individual so when the

201
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,870
the server so that these passwords the
same a

202
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,670
you just say that up to the special you
cannot use them again

203
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,469
so people can do to try to to store your
password and give your

204
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,490
key back and that's it and

205
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,550
next time you you don't know okay

206
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,770
and show you some age 40 p.m. used to be
talkin so you know problems

207
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,780
like the SUN misses from out next door
Excel

208
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,010
or you have the all the version from
SafeNet you have the the little button

209
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,490
both

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,630
are a jew TP or for example you have a

211
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,030
you have a credit cards with display on
its or you can have also

212
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,240
you be key which is also talkin

213
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,770
this is a bit more intelligence because
you you slut in

214
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,160
in the USB and it's like a keyboard is
like before

215
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,569
this one but these are the nice one this
was a bad one

216
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,589
process have a nice idea can try to put
the circuit on this one

217
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,770
you know you'll be key the community
been

218
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,339
but a with the Yuki you have the
generator in it you have no battery

219
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,260
and when you click on it the USB power
or the will stuff and we generate

220
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,380
automatically a new

221
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,880
love total and the talk and will be
written directly

222
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,200
like a keyboard so this is a little
keyboard with talking to the ritual

223
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,650
and of course you have also your mobile
phone so

224
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,319
this is the upper one but you you too XO
Android and even on

225
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,180
blackberry you know red sometimes

226
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,250
you have also some simple the solution
like this I miss talkin suffers the guy

227
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,640
a connect and say okay I'm user

228
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,089
E and you receive an SMS like that did
the

229
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,750
read before to have my key for the wifi
and after I receive my

230
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,770
might open have to send my username and
password

231
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,199
I'm i talkin the of I will for example
checked if the

232
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,050
SMS is the correct one by the
multi-server and

233
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,530
if it's okay I can have access to my
summer or maybe even services

234
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,740
so let's talk now is to be to work over

235
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,750
open to solution which is called the
most you TP for multiple

236
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,459
to be a.m. the history of the maturity
package

237
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,819
is in 2009 we make a proof-of-concept

238
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,459
about implementing the mood to TP
protocol in PHP

239
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,609
into them 10 we implement

240
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,630
the basic T booty P and Edgewood TV
program

241
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,630
and the in 2000 you know when we do a
workshop during a

242
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,390
SF you know it was an Application
Security Forum

243
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,680
in 2012 weeee have a way to the Roman

244
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
the community and we have a lot of
feedbacks even from China

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,360
and that in 2013 a we have had a lot of
new functionality

246
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,589
like your SMS to Kim's scratch but what
leads

247
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,600
you are code

248
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,810
provisioning we show you that later a
clan server implementation with local

249
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,300
cache

250
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,550
because some people use that you in
special ways so we

251
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,160
Robert we have also my school back in
support and the

252
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,089
we r complain for with %eh distribution
we are not certified because you have to

253
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,780
pay a lot

254
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,189
to be so if I put your complaint with
and we have made a a commercial projects

255
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,770
which is

256
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,870
certified so the lebanese

257
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,620
the 60 it will workers a

258
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,730
why did you have the Moto GP package

259
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,310
so at the beginning it was because a no
free and

260
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,119
easy to use solution exist for a small
companies because we are consoled

261
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,190
we are doing consulting in computers for
small companies and it was just too

262
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,150
expensive to have this kind of solutions

263
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,420
a a lot of existing commercial products
a

264
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,120
needs Windows Server and specific
Windows Server we specific version that

265
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,240
such were so it was very difficult to
install it

266
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,090
but people don't have a sober on the
right one or firewall that

267
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,470
cut all the TVA access so it was very
difficult and

268
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,890
existing products needs also a lot of
resources I don't know why

269
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,040
because a you just have to check some
some stuff few seconds better

270
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,020
as they have as a the back ends they
have problem probably

271
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,390
SQL Server Oracle what whatever so it
takes a lot of resources for nothing

272
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,300
so way we did that open source just
because a

273
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,859
we receive the in this way we receive a
lot of feedback some proposal from the

274
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,430
Museum's

275
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,689
the security issues are analyzed by
although the robbers

276
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,010
so you have a lot of but to very nice
and users can be sure that

277
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,530
there is no try on and other in this %uh
friendly tours in the cold

278
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,490
so they can just have a look at the code
and a fresh US but

279
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,530
why did did you do that in in PHP
because

280
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,970
those so many although nice languages
let's see C-plus

281
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,150
central the so weedy we did that in an
open source PHP our class

282
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,319
and also everything and put it in only
15 of course when we develop we have

283
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,170
several fis

284
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,099
but after we put everything together
just because the people sometimes when

285
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,160
they are not very

286
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,360
they have not a high-level we just try
to make PHP they don't know

287
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,380
where to put the fires on way to the
required to twice a week would only 15

288
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,910
its

289
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,969
OS independent and so it works also

290
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,070
and you absolutely including insured
hosting so you can have

291
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,580
from now you can have storm with
additions over

292
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,520
on your website on and your with Sharon

293
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,010
data are stored in front fis at the
beginning but you can also choose mostly

294
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,869
database now

295
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,579
so that was also babies and because we
want to make a very cheap

296
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,060
device after like this one so if you put
I don't know

297
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,190
alright cool my spirit will not work so
much

298
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,560
and if you use for example is too light
which is a database in only one file

299
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,040
and you remove the power at the

300
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,220
not a good moment probes all your that
about databases scratched

301
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,340
because very small US so we just decided
to make ratifies

302
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,110
all methods are implemented common like
to

303
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,370
so we have a separate command line tool
which into the library

304
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,379
and the you can do what you want with
this one its

305
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,049
percent it's compatible with its
centralized the

306
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,580
open source for the division so the
freeradius which we use

307
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,649
and its also available in Windows the
system is riddled and create so

308
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,469
the scripps in order to handle the
package in to create users

309
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,610
so if you have a list of users you just
make all your lands

310
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,678
19 per user and you can create all the
user you want

311
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,970
the commenced on there are supported so
we are doing my

312
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,970
mobile ltp which was the first I don't

313
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,139
but also issue TP tube TP we do SMS
tokens and also

314
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,820
scratch space was leased she's a nice to
recover like to discuss

315
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,039
oppose issue to be a huge piece of it
opens conceivably

316
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,090
can simply be configured by flashing a
QR code solar generating a QR code like

317
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,779
Google

318
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,899
in order to to prison your talkin

319
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,949
and the hardware talking divisions can
also be important so for example if you

320
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,389
have this kind of tokens

321
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:51,729
you can import the fis Anza after that

322
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,120
the seeds of your tokens in is in the
server

323
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,539
and you can use your hardware tokens to
to have different one

324
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:03,169
at the beginning which way with but Nick
diffusion fights which was appropriate

325
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:03,760
defies

326
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,190
issue of eyes my personal issue we have
a separate division foes

327
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,600
and now we do a and used under

328
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,510
PS cuz he fights used to be simple would
you I has nothing to do with them it's a

329
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,590
new feature am

330
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,720
under Windows its installing three
minutes so if you have a

331
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,899
Windows you don't need to sober even
Windows XP

332
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,350
is working so you just have on Mitchell
to be that net

333
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,469
you don't know the resolution yeah mode

334
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,630
exactly buttercup but you can take your

335
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,760
its people to you can put it in the DMZ
without any connection to the Internet

336
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,100
a you done all this version

337
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,500
so a great to Windows 8 perhaps a

338
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,549
you unpacked the fighting those ugity
before there's

339
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:56,299
you can also unpackaged in C Bergen but
its more common to

340
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:01,320
used right name a you can read
optionally the Read Me file

341
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,379
if you want but not really necessary
because you have overstepped their

342
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:08,510
and after you have on Windows to install
the free reader service

343
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,000
so we make a little script just install
that and that's it

344
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,330
so you have your own your server open
your

345
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,439
Windows machine to create the user on
the server side

346
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,450
so it's very easy to do that

347
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,260
because the in the common line you just
say most you TP

348
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,500
first period and you put the name of the
user and the use of resources we created

349
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,399
or update and after you can save the QR
code

350
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,418
love love this user the stalk them

351
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:41,200
so you time 02 TP -2 end quote the name
of the user

352
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,720
and the the fire we want to put to the
QR code

353
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,580
and look like or discrete and that's it
so

354
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,080
its even simpler with the raspberry P
edition because I make a little

355
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,120
web J you I so it's to do that

356
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,820
but it's quite easy and and do you have
to send that to occur to the user of

357
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,250
course

358
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,990
me to use a secure channel you send it
by email it's not so nice

359
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,740
a on the other side

360
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,889
yeah yeah

361
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:15,399
you don't give up on the other size

362
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,110
how the problem a how to proceed on the
totem

363
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,740
is very simple at first we started
Google over 2kg if you don't have it

364
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,899
and you scan the QR code and that's it
you have your new user

365
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:30,229
and the based on the was

366
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,580
it works years rather have to make a

367
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,529
morsel but it works because I tried
before and the

368
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:46,620
you kenya installed on Android US
blackberry and if you have all their

369
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,070
order to Keisha solutions

370
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,980
perhaps you it's not possible to to
flush the QR code so you need to take

371
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,260
the permit or switches

372
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,269
prevails okay

373
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:00,899
the text with this took an israeli and
it works

374
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:05,360
the on the server now to order to give
the user is very easy

375
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,580
use moco TP you put the user name and
you

376
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,889
the

377
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,010
the talk and that you see and you
receive took an acceptable to confuse

378
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,460
or we can't reference number two

379
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,990
the same token and of course its refused
but

380
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,760
usual adding that the move because no
you don't and you can also create some

381
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,210
scratch bus was lists

382
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,780
so it's also easy you say minor scratch
lists

383
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,629
and the name of the user and you will
receive a bunch

384
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,630
of here 10 but you can configure it a
lot

385
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,880
of scratch passwords so it's it works
together

386
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,820
so you can have a total and this
response was for recovery purposes

387
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,980
at the event you can also for example

388
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,570
imports how we're talking to you as we
said so it's easier to

389
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,500
Moto GP import and you put your file and
you will receive a list of the different

390
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,950
hardware token that we're

391
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,050
important and after you can link the
user with the

392
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,120
we've been talkin and it says OK and
after

393
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,959
the and I put upriver enable the prefix
been

394
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,020
to have the re two-factor authentication

395
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,670
so I know I put

396
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,310
1234 but he pushes for example you can
put more than

397
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:24,560
more than 40 pins so its independent
because of put alphanumeric numbers

398
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,780
typical usage so you can you can not
have a firewall there

399
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,879
and you have your talkin when you're
phone

400
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,620
or Azahara talkin and after you just
look at your firewall

401
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,429
and you have access to your summer and
the server as we can

402
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,410
he just after could be your Raspberry Pi
so

403
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,640
how to set up a device for less than 100
dollars which is the key today

404
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,880
first we choose

405
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,920
the hardware so a after

406
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,120
us Seal Beach what's going there I found
a very very cheap

407
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,659
sober which is Elena where we can
install Linux

408
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,890
so Raspberry Pi is thirty-five dollars

409
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,830
and you have no or was licensed to pay
because you can use a

410
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,439
Debian Linux or others it's widely
distributed

411
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,470
and you have a big community support
it's a meter USB powered

412
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,870
so you don't even need to have power I
put that in my computer directly

413
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,020
the CPU's 700 megahertz with Lisa

414
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,790
I'm based so it's not the United have
not a 64-bit

415
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:35,370
but it still okay for what we want to do
and the run is 512 megabytes

416
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,389
and the the storage is just a is the cut

417
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,640
so you can you cannot see okay we see

418
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,720
here because I put only 21 okay

419
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,470
so you take your Raspberry Pi
thirty-five dollars

420
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,620
you take your is the card ten dollars

421
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,449
okay you at Moto GP on it all the way
you know work

422
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,470
pro-union story time clock which is
about fifteen dollars it works with

423
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,080
raspberrypi each is because if you have
made it

424
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,030
TOTP tokens and the

425
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,139
you are not connected to the internet
you will not have the real time on your

426
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,790
machine

427
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,159
and it would be very difficult to be.
the right windows because we stop for

428
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,090
win2000

429
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,490
so that's why it's better to have a
return trip

430
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,620
so there is different kinds we support
in the

431
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,739
library country we support to love them
I think there's only two

432
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,160
on the market you need a nice for
enclosure

433
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,420
because it's nice 0 you see Anza

434
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,430
and and you need a optional your power
supply if you don't have a your

435
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,170
or most of the time the fire will now
have a USB port

436
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,700
to put for example 3G okie so just do
this one to power your

437
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,970
server it's enough five what's okay

438
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:55,280
and okay I was laying for eighty dollars
you have your you have your

439
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,370
server okay

440
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,120
so perhaps alleged deal with %uh a
Raspberry Pi

441
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,290
so I started already

442
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,750
the machine and in

443
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,080
okay what we need the G way and perhaps
also

444
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,439
something to test the region's so this
is the Regius

445
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,910
plant he's the Rosamund Pike so first a
need to login

446
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,360
so it's a very basic interface witty

447
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,949
easier for me to do a demo here later as
a with the common

448
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,950
well sorry you don't see it the problem

449
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,340
strange

450
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,050
'em it's a feature of a power point

451
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:49,050
very nice can Italy's again

452
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,689
him so as I taught

453
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,430
this is the the blur this is the

454
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,690
with Julie very simple and here we have
our

455
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,410
for the mixtape we have our regis claims

456
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,170
just to see if everything's okay so at
the beginning I make the login

457
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,410
default password is 1234 okay in

458
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,810
and okay attention the possibles

459
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,110
to put 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

460
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,070
a and we can create the user sorry

461
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,720
solid-state it's a week with the you the
Bergen

462
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,080
I sacred the user so it make everything
automatically so

463
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,669
management blur and now the idea is to

464
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,940
from is your own a gonna come so you
will be able to use your

465
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,520
your phone so I just print a
configuration file and

466
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,610
we have a letter template and all
templates we give some informations

467
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,479
so have generated committee appeal 5212

468
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,080
name is burger it says blahblahblah
stuff

469
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,100
you can read it later perhaps the
interesting things

470
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,399
is it said that's okay we'll have to
have a a QR code reader

471
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,850
okay seconds you have to install Google
to Decatur so you have the QR code for

472
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,449
doing that

473
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,650
and at the dance you have two provisions
your your

474
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,070
talkin so in love somebody have Google
to teach you there's no virus in it

475
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,429
so you have it or you have to freshen

476
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,520
so I fish

477
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,980
because for the

478
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,150
restore the demo it's important to have
a good could could

479
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:39,150
you

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,780
so

481
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,530
so you remember just we just have to
scan put the QR code

482
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,120
that's it no have the cleaners

483
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,899
mccain and

484
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,870
a serial killer so now have the usable
in here and the

485
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,340
okay we can do more but I think it's a
very useful for you

486
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,530
one is enough and I'll now let's go on
the

487
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,440
on the register clients so I was similar
to what the roof I was doing

488
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,040
so the only thing is that I don't
remember

489
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,080
the Penal Code

490
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,750
ominous

491
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,390
5 2012 okay a

492
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,460
saudi riyal 5212 the password

493
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,980
and after need to put the code it's 1321

494
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,770
471 it's okay for 30 seconds it's

495
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,070
rate reading here but as we have a we
don't delay in the server

496
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,399
I can still talking for two minutes
before train

497
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,810
password but then we do that right now
because I have nothing else to do a

498
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,399
so I send the request in fact they need
to click to rate in the button

499
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,970
okay and you see use either

500
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,030
ok it's a the summer which says response

501
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,160
access except some very happy I'll just
try to send the second time the same

502
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,210
password because it says

503
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,220
access reject okay

504
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,280
so this is how the the so

505
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,639
so wats so nothing more because

506
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,050
you just have to create users and after
you just have to

507
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,879
check if the user's working well I think
I have

508
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,920
last night for the questions

509
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,000
it is a nice lace so in

510
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,760
so do you have any questions about the
about that

511
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,300
or something that is not clear US

512
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:52,300
which second boobs yes

513
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,899
that you didn't see that her

514
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,970
because it was there but it was under

515
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,100
so so the question was

516
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,399
do we only a provide QR codes or can we
use something s

517
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,429
so I didn't score up to the end of the
the paper

518
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:21,059
but okay eastward how it's in the same
stuff

519
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:28,059
okay cycles this common and

520
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,459
you see here you have to agree

521
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,190
you have the seed a the number digit and
time interval

522
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,190
your questions yet

523
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:50,299
you can configure

524
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:57,230
did well

525
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,350
I for testing is not is not good because
the

526
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,428
your your talking is every 30 seconds

527
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:07,220
generated everything seconds and after
you must be sure that it's it's even is

528
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,200
with your device because the time you
read this

529
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,540
the season you right its but that's more
than 10 seconds and you will never be

530
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,168
able to

531
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:16,240
11 so but you yeah

532
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,880
and the Configure you can tell you that
and if it's Evan Bayh's you can also fix

533
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,580
the window

534
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,080
Evans yes

535
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,659
yep

536
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,660
up yep

537
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:38,450
yeah not from those were have already
confirmed your identity on the machines

538
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,630
so if you have internet is not a problem
a

539
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,360
and it configure automatically the
return talk if you have one

540
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,540
so the next time if you remove internet
you still have the butter some people so

541
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,260
Kate strong authentication server we
don't want to put it

542
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,350
with a access to the Internet that's
where they put that in the gym

543
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,879
and in this case you need to return to
look because if you stop it

544
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,660
you don't you don't have the time all
the questions

545
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,360
yeah

546
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,418
so what is

547
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:19,370
different with the

548
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,500
what is the difference a window size a
good

549
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,940
for what is the default Windows oh I
think it would 600 seconds

550
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,000
for the time-based and the

551
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,310
I think it was 50 for the for the

552
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,070
evens but you can change that Inc in a
configuration

553
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:44,070
5 no because a at the big the

554
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,469
300 seconds just because a

555
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,580
the to content can be on seek a nice
especially for hardware tokens

556
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,139
if you are using a software talkers like
with the phones

557
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,310
know you can put that sixty seconds or
perhaps 120 seconds

558
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,679
because normally all the networks are
synchronized

559
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,350
okay so perhaps you can just change that
but its just one line

560
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:12,719
yes up

561
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:18,459
yep was yep

562
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,020
yeah i think is very simple because you
you calculate the

563
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,230
the Real Talk and after you take the
first one

564
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,449
the previews won the second one the
second before

565
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:31,649
and when you when you do find it soco it
was

566
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,429
two minutes okay so I i put

567
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,549
Delta from two minutes in the
configuration for the user

568
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:41,619
and the next time it will be directly to
help

569
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:44,720
of course because you don't share the
same token

570
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,569
with pop

571
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:56,569
I yeah even tried

572
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,189
with all the register services yep saw a

573
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,380
had the for those register was called

574
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,530
take refuse on Windows which is free a

575
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,970
with they have a free version also a
commercial version and it was also

576
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,299
so I have work with this guy under
Windows because the free ridge's was not

577
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,030
working at the beginning with weirdos

578
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,599
and for the little story they don't have
any external a call for

579
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,640
to make notification so response sort a

580
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,470
the development for that a in fact one
of my customers sponsored

581
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,419
but even for that and so we were able to
make a strong indication

582
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,839
on Windows with another register but now
I'm happy to have the free regions

583
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,339
because who have the same configuration
face which is you

584
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,849
you can use it on Linux and on Windows
known if you can

585
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:49,720
called an external fire it works yes im

586
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,569
if the people can have

587
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:57,759
multiple devices so the only it's only
one talking for the moment

588
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,030
and a Squatch password lists and also
the

589
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,260
SMS passwords so I think it's enough to
to have backups

590
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,349
but I didn't the country I didn't choose
to have

591
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,970
different organs for the same people
just choice

592
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,410
the beginning I know a thing about Yes
No said no

593
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,160
okay

594
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,808
up like a
