1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,439
up with us

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,660
so variables welcome back

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,330
firms import no

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,439
shape yeah I know on the weather

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,259
better there so no I

6
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,600
the very first but at work but warmer I
well

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,650
yep

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,860
minor yes and

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,250
thank you very much for the very kind
reduction a wonderful

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,460
so what I'm talking about the dais

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,129
what I'm calling youthful password
hashing that about password hashing I

12
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:53,739
guess you're

13
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,570
know what that means arm minority I
apply for

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,390
30 minutes then I had one hour so I'm
stopping some more stuff

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,089
the end a stop them working about and
will probably do it in a

16
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,250
and voting way I'm proposing a topic and
you can say a that some interesting or

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:09,920
that doesn't

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,610
but recovered later so first is about
password

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,979
hashing I am now most I think 95 percent
of you knows the password hashing

20
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,360
is so last year the kittens seen

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,060
trippin kinda listing armed you're
looking for those that are

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,680
bored by what's on the left side of the
slide um for storing passwords we all

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,900
know that we shouldn't store them in
playing

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,939
still enough sites do it but they
shouldn't shows assault them Zegers

25
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,889
to think around salt you are computing
some

26
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,909
hash function a star which can be a hash
function can be iterated hash function

27
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,770
can be something else it will be
something else in the sequel

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,360
then you're storing S&H on the heart is
going to verify you are just

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,439
re computing the value H even develop
estate your retreating from

30
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,600
from the fire and then you test if the
store

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,100
a sequel to The age that you re computed
now of course the all-knowing of

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,810
guessing attack is if the adversary
Lawrence S&H then he can

33
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,250
death the password candidate verify if
that once correct and then we

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,910
just start that process over and over
until we finally find a

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,060
password candidate CIA that match that
verification here

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,579
now they're two ways to improve the
security apartment against

37
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,260
of land guessing attacks first this by
making the user choosing stronger

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,078
passwords

39
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,940
which usually fail to do and the other
point where we can improve the situation

40
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,989
is by

41
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,570
making the process of verification

42
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,638
lower this basically what all the
constructors are doing the things up

43
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,829
B crib yesterday the trip pretty slow in
their fourth

44
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:53,470
considered relatively 6 your now they're

45
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,769
yeah what I just said just lowered the
stage star

46
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,160
is the more securities against of
guessing attacks however this lowered is

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,389
the more annoying it is for the store
operator because the spending more

48
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,419
contagion cycles on computing that

49
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,030
has functioned age starter some numbers

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,269
you're probably well aware of those
plane md5 is pretty fast and graphics

51
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:14,799
cards

52
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,220
be crypt is not that fast in graphics
cards arm

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,650
and that's like the crips considered
more secure than if I

54
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,810
now the thing is that

55
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,209
even if the function is is pretty slow
still

56
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,949
if you're looking at the rock your data
set we can do 100 guess there

57
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,989
we fear doing 100 guess is we can still
bring about five percent of the accounts

58
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,850
now just look at those numbers here even
the relatively slow

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,108
be cryptic 4,000 tests per second um

60
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:46,489
needs about 14 to you of a second for
breaking 50

61
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,010
for breaking five percent the occult for
his bed

62
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,290
right I'm and if we say that an account
should withstand let's say

63
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,328
a minute of password cracking on that
system here which is

64
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:05,639
not the best that you can do of course
from it when we stand for a couple of

65
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,299
minutes

66
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,720
then you're ending up with several
seconds are for the hash marks

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,829
no sir operator will ever be that's my
guess

68
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,949
that seems to be to will be willing to
spend several seconds

69
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,299
for just computing one password hash arm

70
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,380
so

71
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,139
what could we do in this disclaimer to
coming

72
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,240
in two seconds arm what you're trying to
do

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,610
is if we are managing to

74
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,380
make this computational a star
interesting

75
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,909
for the server operator if this is not
just about burning cycles

76
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,360
but if this is about computing something
that is interesting to the server

77
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,030
operator

78
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,960
what everything means for now good

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,640
good idea year doesn't work

80
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,770
for reasons I'll explain in fights like
this me um

81
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,880
you can use those cycle for something
useful

82
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
then we hope that's our operators might
be willing to spend more time

83
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,190
password hashing you stronger password
hashes and therefore improve

84
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,480
overall security arm now

85
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,930
that means that we are proposing to you
a star to compute

86
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,420
a solution to another problem the sites
of computing a password hash

87
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,000
solving some other problem which we will
call base problem

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,180
and the result constructive a star

89
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,590
will be called a useful password hash to
pH for short

90
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,039
and this is what I'm going to bother to
talk about the next 50

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,390
20 minutes or so before

92
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,560
giving you more details and better over
few

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,030
disclaimer I'm this is academic research

94
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,809
this is not production ready for a
couple of reasons the program state

95
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,710
something with

96
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,729
the competition which is

97
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,300
tech not really true you're not planning
on submitting that

98
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,890
to the competition because this is
really research

99
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,050
arm if nothing that we expect to be

100
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,840
used in practice next year and the other
thing is we have to feel you have a

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,520
question

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,880
just raise your fingers from propping up
now but wait for the next slide

103
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,050
starting then I'm whenever you feel you
have a question

104
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,990
just if we do interrupt me and I'm I
feel free to ignore

105
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,350
Press yeah good so

106
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,230
again the overall picture is you have to
server

107
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,600
let's say this server is doing the

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,110
arm the login but at the same site
there's a large computer server which is

109
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,050
computing

110
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,280
something being of arm scientific
computations

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,780
the big compute clusters arm

112
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,719
he's done by the forecast whatever arm
English somehow trying to

113
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,280
combined that server with that
computational power to

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,659
get something which fits together it
words

115
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,690
works well let's start with an example

116
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,290
arm I'm showing you in construction now
where the

117
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,060
underlying base problem is brute force
TS

118
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,510
approved forcing de eso brute forcing a
DES key

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,010
given a message in a cipher text now you
might argue that's not really useful but

120
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,000
that's just for the

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,960
take the exam because he thirty percent
and assume you're really interested

122
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,989
in breaking specific death

123
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,110
arm we just by the way kind of 20 to 25

124
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,700
to 256 operations that's within

125
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,570
within reach so the base problem

126
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,090
is you are giving a message and the
cipher text

127
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,169
encrypt it using death with the key

128
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,590
k0 and you're going to find case euro

129
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,590
what you doing practices you're just
trying out all keys

130
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,060
keys keys k0 encrypting

131
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,990
m0 under 20 and you're getting a cipher
text me creating the right one

132
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,510
then you're done that's how do you solve
it now

133
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,669
I'll show you how you solve it using a
password hash

134
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,719
and what you're doing is you're picking
a time

135
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,970
BT this is the time that your password
hash

136
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,030
shoot take to compute which is of course
an average time

137
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,119
a on a specific architecture blah blah

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,690
arm and you're selecting a permit gamma
so that

139
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,990
22 the gamma times TDs is about

140
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,659
the time P that you want to help so this
means that

141
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,669
camera is selecting the beats of the key
that improved forcing

142
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,309
onto on average you're finding the
correct

143
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,790
until whenever if you're spending time T

144
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,650
to come I might be around 10 or
something 10 he picks up a bit more

145
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,180
tricky

146
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,560
whatever now

147
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,619
for storing a password so this is about

148
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,350
the function a star for storing a
password

149
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,920
you are selecting first on wrandell

150
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,750
are and a random

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,020
second part of the key the key suffix

152
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,120
I which hath size come up with one so
this is the part that you're going to

153
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,190
put forth later

154
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,440
and you're selecting a prefix but not
random about kinda friendly

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,040
but not choosing a uniformly at random
but by hashing

156
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,490
this random billion the password
together so this is basically

157
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,320
a random value based on the password

158
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,640
and we're salting it in a way by using
that

159
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,220
are here this if the second half of the
key

160
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,120
so then PK one is the prefix computer
tearing the suffix

161
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,120
chosen you so if this more less a random

162
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,220
DES key yep

163
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,220
and it's a random BS key from a subset
which

164
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,970
is indicated by that prefix which is
computed from the password

165
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,740
and are now what we're doing is

166
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,980
we are using this key k1

167
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,279
to encrypt m0 m0 its from our challenge
this is part of the base problem we're

168
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,700
thinking about

169
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,420
encrypting that with k1 which is not the
key from the base problem

170
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,640
probably not the key from the base
problem be getting a cipher text

171
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,580
C-one in addition to using

172
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,200
this key k1 as assault in normal

173
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
password hash let's say this can be just
any hash function whatever

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,190
would be restoring is of course you're
user ID or something

175
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,330
we're storing the hashed value H
computed here you're storing the random

176
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,220
value

177
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,580
chosen here which gives the prefix

178
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,070
if you know the password and C Wong

179
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,230
which is from here

180
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,390
so yep C-one kinda surfaced yet any fire

181
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,760
um this allows us to identify whenever
we have the correct key

182
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,410
k1 and get a k-1 years confused

183
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,560
sold set before became

184
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,160
okie take your deep breath me

185
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,170
questions

186
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,439
we're basically choosing a random key
and using that he s

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,630
salt in another s

188
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,750
in addition to competing c1 and identify
your

189
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,940
a within a second why we need that one
okay

190
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,949
how'd we verify password: given

191
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:40,949
this string verify password:

192
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,019
exec just plug it in the top into

193
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,559
re computer imputed arm and that's
possible that's the

194
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,639
important thing to realize you can re
compute

195
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,429
the prefix well you can re computer
something that

196
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,509
is probably the prefix if your password
is correct this is Kay prefix

197
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:04,379
here we know dr. we have restored

198
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:09,169
the suffix key suffix casings that we
have it to rate

199
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:12,739
over all possible values there are two
to come up with one

200
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:16,259
values whatever rich we would spend

201
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,759
a to to the gum up so haha those here

202
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,379
to become a free member thats
influencing the time

203
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:28,139
BT from two slides before we r

204
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,819
yet putting prefix and suffix together
to have a key

205
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,858
K from and we

206
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:38,689
encrypt m0 again with Katie

207
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,988
testing if there's a C-one so if

208
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:45,659
k is que won the youth the one that we
had before

209
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,720
then this test will succeed arm

210
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,249
if

211
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:59,309
the if the password is the wrong one

212
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:03,019
then we have the wrong prefix in this
test will always feel

213
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,489
high probability for the wrong password
this test will always

214
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:10,759
failed if we have to be correct password

215
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,159
then the prefix is the correct one and
then

216
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,269
iterating over also fix with eventually

217
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,989
we will hit the right suffix eventually

218
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:26,709
this Katie will be 81 so eventually will
have to write

219
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,939
key it if care K here is

220
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:34,329
sk1 in this test will succeed because
this is exactly how we could be two

221
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:35,049
C-one

222
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:39,929
are on the previous flight probe is why
is that if you want to see identify your

223
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,769
you want allows us to identify when this
key here

224
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:49,379
is the K Wong from the previous slide
arm

225
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:54,659
yes if we have to write key here that
you can use that he s the salt in the

226
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,999
final hashing and if the password is
right

227
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:03,639
then this hash this this comparison will

228
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,399
succeed otherwise because for you or we
will

229
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,889
even failed to find a suitable K over
here so noticed just

230
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,999
not so useful because that's just the
password hash

231
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,379
there's nothing useful to you now what
makes the thing

232
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,350
useful is that we are computing a lot of

233
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,249
encryptions here and what we can do as
you can a very short operation began

234
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:34,009
officially test the outcome here if that
don't you hear

235
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:40,749
equals c0 which was part of the original
problem remember we want to find it he

236
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:45,499
a key K through that and 0 in group 2 30

237
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:49,350
if we eventually find the key

238
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,339
k so that this test years succeeds then

239
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,859
we have thought Arby's problem then we
have to carefully brute forced

240
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:02,859
the yes crips the restart with and

241
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:06,249
I should say that once we did a possible
education here

242
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:09,809
enable successful then we should create
fresh um

243
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,709
password hash the injured start with
that's like again

244
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,799
store the password you past for being
able to do

245
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:25,799
you in use for computations for the next
possible verification okay

246
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,279
bad loss technical I am fully aware

247
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,149
impairs a test for putting profiting
from those lights for

248
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,359
distracting those that are following
from

249
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:40,909
you have any questions about

250
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:44,769
the construction given here I will break
it down to a

251
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:49,539
slightly more informal level London into
flights or so on the next flight

252
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:53,909
arm but do you feel like you can or you
want ask questions here

253
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:57,289
well

254
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,629
I means that everybody understood that
nobody interested

255
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:04,110
me with a good start arm

256
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,889
but apart from the

257
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,029
specific construction let's take two
steps back

258
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,569
I what our properties that we wont

259
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:18,889
such useful password hash to fulfil

260
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:22,600
arm we have it here right I'm to the

261
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,679
general I moved somewhere else on the

262
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,149
general idea here of the construction is
you have a

263
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:33,829
a problem which is highly pearlized IPL
PS proved forces

264
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,309
embarrassingly a paralyzed below I'm
just test the ski apparel

265
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:43,569
you're selecting subset this was done by
hitting the password and fixing a prefix

266
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,259
arm this should depend on the password
because otherwise

267
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:50,279
arm you can reuse the computation

268
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,039
for for all passwords your testing we
are selecting a random

269
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,159
instance from that's upset by selecting

270
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,319
a random so fix in the DS construction

271
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,688
we are solving one of those subproblems

272
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,010
computing yes encryption

273
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,260
then we didn't really split in the
previous example above use the

274
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,658
encryption directive identify air and
then stored

275
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,839
to stop all the haz identify air

276
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,938
and description of the random subset
which was the are

277
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,159
the previous example because are
determined the prefix

278
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,369
so what are

279
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:34,139
properties that the base problem or the
entire constructors would fulfill in

280
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:35,869
order to be useful for

281
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:38,899
for anything from it should be

282
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:42,239
interesting for the site owner of course
the the timid

283
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,330
owner of the site should have interest
in solving that problem

284
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,389
otherwise you cannot adopt them arm

285
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:51,519
but it should be less or not interesting
for an attacker

286
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,059
now the first thing here kinda hints at
it going are you

287
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,279
correctly said I mean if it would be
cool if you could

288
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:02,519
mine pit Corinth while doing has for
education I mean that

289
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,859
sounds pretty possible problem

290
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:11,710
this holds for the bet I as well so
whoever is mine pecans can just do

291
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,299
password hashing for free so back
incentives

292
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,330
unfortunately and some technical
problems because

293
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,330
the has changed advancing in the latency
so

294
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,090
time between storing a password hash in
verifying a poptart expertise large so

295
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,168
you would need to frequently updated and
we don't have any mechanism 100

296
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,529
unfortunately that would be really cool
right

297
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,809
kids I'm me

298
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,899
better examples arm potentially better
examples we don't mmm

299
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,080
well we know constructions for the
second and third we don't know one for

300
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
the first one but

301
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,949
let's say would be cool if you could do
would be exponentiation sorry some of

302
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,460
the exponentiation

303
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,399
in the ESL handshake using password
hashes logging server

304
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,428
maybe string password hashing and FL

305
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:04,879
as well or at least service close to
each other so

306
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,070
while computer password hashes we could
test use the

307
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,490
much expectation is a byproduct that
would be pretty cool

308
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,820
but that doesn't seem to work for a
variety of reasons

309
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,730
what we can do is arm factoring

310
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,940
bike factoring large integers their our
constructions

311
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,330
which you can massage the

312
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,000
factoring algorithm to a password hash
we can do

313
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,869
deluxe computations we even can do when
we have a

314
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:37,510
pretty much working implementation for
the Smiths more min

315
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,908
local sequence DNA alignment which is
pretty cool

316
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:46,159
that the problem is you ever large part
of DNA and you wanna

317
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,809
find small parts of DNA

318
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,428
not exact matches but similar metres in
the long part in depth

319
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,519
highly pearlized as well finding the
correct position

320
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,029
computing similarity metrics for for
each position

321
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,250
that will work arm and I

322
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,609
showed you and you have to believe me
burke's example for

323
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:10,889
group forced yes which is purely
academic of course

324
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:14,439
mostly I guess any

325
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,950
are more properties that you wanna have
is correctness of course

326
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,250
I'm correct path which would be except
that otherwise it's pretty boring

327
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,470
construction

328
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,599
also the solution to the base problem
should be correct because otherwise

329
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,779
well there's no use for using the
construction

330
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,700
arm yet all here we can

331
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,720
assume that the server follows the
protocol because yet an incentive for

332
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,789
both crackers occasion and correct this
problem

333
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,908
efficiency is another potential issue it
means that

334
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,929
from if the

335
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:55,809
original algorithm for solving a basic
problem

336
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,658
is much more efficient then when you're
using

337
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,129
a useful parts for test computed then

338
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,379
everybody would use the original
algorithm in the construction that

339
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,699
useful the time difference

340
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,409
between solving the base problem on its
own

341
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,879
and folding the base problem using a
password hash should not be

342
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,800
too high arm

343
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,139
I ya there was the overhead actually i
apologize.

344
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,430
what the first point you're set arm

345
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:33,150
is there the resulting construction H
star

346
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,440
should the about equally fast

347
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,120
on the legitimate server and on the

348
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,649
attacker's computer now we all know that
those are never the same

349
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,250
um graphics cards to use are much faster
in solving

350
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,620
well at the spring construction and
probably all constructs that will

351
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,189
come so weekend it most hope for being

352
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,620
approximately s efficient arm

353
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,620
but that's good enough all year
requiring

354
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,500
is that there's no factor of 10 or so or
100 between the legitimate server

355
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,230
and the the adversary I

356
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,510
once you start using external data

357
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,020
or even external code for relying on

358
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,300
critical things like password hashing
yet a problem that

359
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,440
the adversary might control the external
input

360
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,360
either the tower or cold to your
algorithm

361
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,409
and the construction of course to
tolerate that it's not an issue

362
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,830
it all for the yes um brute force

363
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,480
unless nobody even knows the solution to

364
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,500
so the yes example is resilient

365
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,550
to military shows in data but there
might be other

366
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,580
face problems that are not resumed to
recently

367
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,990
militantly to India and you should
carefully construction

368
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,790
to considered that problem and

369
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,909
course we are given the right relying
here on

370
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,370
non standard cryptographic something but
we're doing that all day long so that

371
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,850
should be

372
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,570
fine guess but if you keep in mind

373
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,149
that you're on shaky ground in with
standard

374
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,910
every from a theory point a few mmm

375
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,400
and of course you wanna be able to
pretty much a test

376
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,420
the compositional Hargis hardness to the
course be premature assisting

377
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,710
if it's not then you're out on your own
anyway

378
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,750
arm one important observation is that

379
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,730
the Stardust not need to be
deterministic so far all password hashes

380
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,850
are getting mystic circle 23 compute

381
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,500
the value and compare this doesn't need
to be the case it could also be

382
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,760
probabilistic if you're choosing a more
clever

383
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,379
verifying function normally not required

384
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,830
your it might be useful arm yeah

385
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,179
hurry can be paralyze the ball which is

386
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,880
a good thing I say I hurt boy sister
disagree here

387
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,880
arm I hope you agree that password
guessing arm

388
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,930
should be pearl Eiffel on because it is

389
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:17,110
anyway on the bursary side so it's for
the good of the

390
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,370
on a server can also speed up computer
asians

391
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,149
by meetings parents

392
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:30,258
yes arm maybe it's a good point to ask
for questions

393
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,090
because then I'm having some

394
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,309
more general remarks on

395
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,340
other constructions arm

396
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,059
and then you're doing your bowling style
continuation for the

397
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:50,759
remaining whatever minutes we have arm

398
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,210
the thing is that

399
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,299
similar constructions are not really
only

400
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,539
from possible for a password hashes

401
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,720
about also for approval works

402
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,980
people don't know prove works

403
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,080
from Congress Ben prevention ever
proposed $100 million times

404
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,509
to do so I think they're not redeployed

405
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,059
all the I don't think so for

406
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,039
variety of reasons but the things that
he can also using similar construction

407
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,090
built useful approval works I'm

408
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,480
where you can outsource a computation to
the

409
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,679
prufer in that setting arm

410
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,369
which is even nicer for several reasons
for example latency is lower

411
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,830
in the pass for example you're behind
the agency between

412
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,740
storing a problem and doing the actual
computation

413
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,190
when verifying the Hess that can be days
or weeks or months are not even sure

414
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,350
that one in

415
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,559
ever going to be sold arm for prove
works

416
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,860
the service giving out to the problem
and

417
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,758
10 seconds most later solutions coming
back

418
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,990
so that's way easier to to handle the
parallelism

419
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,330
arm and you don't have to know the
solution you can

420
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,610
match the resolutions but clients and
yup they're

421
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,418
not a reasons why that is nicer from

422
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,289
bread pudding preposterous notion which
was proposed

423
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:28,740
some years ago and that's all I wanted
to see

424
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,869
about user password hashes and that was
about or

425
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:37,668
that was what I intended that's great so

426
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:41,490
unless they're are coming up questions
now

427
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,490
yes

428
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,440
the question is why you're not doing
simple way

429
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,590
loop for a couple of seconds before

430
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,980
arm acknowledging that the password is
right

431
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,169
this works for online guessing so

432
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:06,669
way and you're looking to fix or server
and the service actually testing

433
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:10,409
and that's perfectly okay and their for
me waiting longer there

434
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,889
accepting three-year fight bad pass
written in the start

435
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:16,889
waiting increasingly longer
exponentially longer something

436
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:21,149
is done right you be concerned with
off-line password guessing so we assume

437
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:22,508
the attacker

438
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:26,639
learns store password hash influence
that

439
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:30,029
than any while loop I'll

440
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:37,029
get at the start yet okay

441
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:42,799
so them filling the question no

442
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,809
I'm filling the meantime for however you

443
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,918
however long you like food is there so
choose wisely

444
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,890
a what else you wanna know arm

445
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,720
who wants to hear three minutes

446
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,510
on implementing be trippin fpga-based
and I'm

447
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,820
hoping to say yes good because that's
about answer to yesterday's

448
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,260
talk wonderful thank you arm it was very
interesting to see that

449
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,270
we are not the only ones trying to
implement be tripped on FPGA

450
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,289
arm we haven't done it

451
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:19,419
to be honest but we're currently in the
process of doing so

452
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:22,570
arm interesting is

453
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,779
we at at University a ball home

454
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:29,120
where I am we have couple of people
working

455
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,370
on harbored and

456
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,020
security let's say and they build a
machine called the

457
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,429
here if your are with a successor of the
copacabana nice replace

458
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,580
but anyway I'm was basically an FPGA
cluster

459
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,960
arm there's a picture of the older model
of the reviewer

460
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,429
which had 128 FPGA arm

461
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,570
features for programming them in peril

462
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,629
arm nice interconnect which we don't
really need there's a PC

463
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,450
I think he's here for controlling the
entire thing it has you met

464
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,460
at the end um and it's pretty cool
because refugees are often very suitable

465
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,350
for

466
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,059
cryptographic purposes that machine can
brute force DES

467
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,490
in one and a half days on average so
it's pretty damn fast

468
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,740
arm and

469
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,649
be crips seems like a probably a good
choice for implementing FPGA is because

470
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:28,750
the not only have martic operations
sales at

471
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,059
Loughran we basically a little bit that
yesterday

472
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,529
so that's a nice picture that machine
what you probably can't see

473
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:40,529
is on here there are

474
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,779
carts republicans %um better here

475
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,840
these are I think sixteen carts with

476
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,789
for FB so be heard the Jason from

477
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,500
control Arctic they're all sitting on a
bus and

478
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,780
yes if it can be program quite easily
also separately

479
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,470
but usually just the same arm

480
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,520
and yet he remembers the PC into

481
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,340
the think here's the power supply

482
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,870
the interesting thing is some this is
depending on your problem around

483
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,530
yet know it's hard to see four times as

484
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,990
powerful as a chief you cluster that we
test it but that's really depends on the

485
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,710
application

486
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,840
prepare the entire machine needs about
600 Watts

487
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,860
so not much I mean that's just free
graphics cards

488
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,270
and it's definitely faster arm

489
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,950
so yesterday's talk implemented be crypt

490
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,590
on something like that in the first line
is that correct

491
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,110
where are you you yet it's arriving at

492
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,059
good wonderful arm the old my love year
are you

493
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:58,850
deputy age from the third line and the
new model use those from the second line

494
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,280
and all the estimated am pretend the
next slide

495
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,830
know that slide actually are using the
second line

496
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,939
FPGA me see they are kinda similar
they're slightly bigger in terms of

497
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,510
lot units allotted units are at least
somewhat compare will be some numbers

498
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,570
to match that doesn't mean too much on
it PGA's

499
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,460
comparable and the available law grad
missiles

500
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:29,320
about the same we have estimates we have
no implementation

501
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,928
have to say that again we have no
implementation but be estimates

502
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,919
and be belief that at least be signed
alien probe justice I'm

503
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,429
be Bill Burke arm and

504
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:44,070
this will result in about 7,000

505
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,090
or fifteen thousand humiliations per
second

506
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,120
per chip time 64 chips we are with

507
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,129
half a million or a million trips per
second

508
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,120
estimates estimates you

509
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,500
and a slightly different hardware
compared to yesterday so there isn't

510
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:03,909
another

511
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:07,520
really comparable and we don't really
know when I'm Telling You More

512
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,000
net I guess Michael good

513
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,440
password strength and reuse probably

514
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,659
know that already but I can tell you we
have a nice data set from

515
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,380
more aware and we have numbers that at
least in the scientific literature

516
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,760
nobody has seen so far interested or not
you a

517
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,429
at least two the opportunity the room
arm we do have a list of passwords

518
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:36,000
extracted from all over time that
company

519
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,100
which is up division of another company
I would ever

520
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,399
collected over the years or over the
month

521
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:48,000
actually arm weeks trek to the rock 3500
passwords

522
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,510
arm from those around $177

523
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,679
who were four financial accounts so we
were interested in comparing

524
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,149
week and strong so I'm important an
important

525
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:04,070
passwords we assume that passwords for
financial accounts

526
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,280
have a high value to the user or at
least that everybody user

527
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,309
will understand that does are valuable
there's a difference between

528
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:15,820
true value in perceived value but we
assume that financial accounts be

529
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,039
should have a hi perceived well at least
a user's

530
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,658
should tried to choose a strong password

531
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,889
for those and all the others are

532
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:30,080
declared to be low value which is of
course not

533
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,020
entirely true but as for the sake of
comparing them with the

534
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,100
certainly high-value accounts here

535
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,309
now what we did is we have to grab
someone on

536
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:48,309
yep

537
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:02,860
up

538
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,879
3 the no

539
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,449
ok that's it interesting testing the

540
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,540
question or suggestion walls

541
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,409
to not only separate to but three
classes at least

542
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,859
adding the accounts with a high

543
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,909
privacy value subsea made a facebook

544
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:30,720
I'm why we didn't do it because

545
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,060
for Facebook

546
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,279
I thinking I'm pretty sure a large
number of people will tell you hey

547
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,639
that's on my Facebook account

548
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,790
I don't care about so that's what I
mention with perceived value and kisses

549
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,879
much really I mean we don't know

550
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,589
but we assume that Facebook accounts
have a pretty you know

551
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:55,219
perceived value on average so not many

552
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:02,220
normal users will try this was a strong
password beer

553
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:08,650
possible

554
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,670
up

555
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:18,319
all

556
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:25,319
I completely agree up

557
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,660
yep I agree agree to the statement that
we should do you study

558
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,560
letting them drink the perceived value
of accounts

559
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,609
but we didn't definitely

560
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:41,730
arm yes

561
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,460
so we want to compare those two sets of
passwords

562
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,599
arm and

563
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,930
the things 177 is not really that much
for doing statistical analysis

564
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,500
also we wanted to compare to other lists
monk got for example which

565
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,970
is hashed only so used on the river

566
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,109
for comparing those which is

567
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,460
of course not the best choice from a
theoretical point of you but

568
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,510
and be that the highly practical
comparison

569
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,720
so that's a nice graphics colors and all
but what does it say

570
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,939
enough to say this is trying to reverse
Mb

571
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,160
its ass that so the interesting lines
are the

572
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,750
black and purple on black are the

573
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,690
no billion passwords and purple are the
financial or

574
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,750
high-value passwords and we see that

575
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,900
indeed not that surprisingly

576
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,069
the financial passwords are I V
financial passwords which is lower curve

577
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:43,250
are indeed stronger and the financial
once

578
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,030
even tho we have of course a lot of
important passwords

579
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,140
in the bottom datasets so they're really

580
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,180
weak passwords will almost certainly be
hi your

581
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,410
a business combination of no and hi

582
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,680
probably won't hide these are only
high-value passwords

583
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,680
there's a difference here yep

584
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,290
which ones well

585
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:18,060
up

586
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:25,060
hop in

587
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,450
yes hop

588
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,790
help

589
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,100
yep

590
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,580
go

591
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,310
a pic kept that interesting

592
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,830
I'm I have to say we did not consider
here

593
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,470
why their strong you a wider choosing
stronger or weaker passwords

594
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:58,910
years of observing that the two of
course this might be caused by

595
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,450
a better password think meter on the
financial side

596
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,009
this might because by a better posture
policy even

597
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,220
arm on the financial sites but the thing
here is the important passwords

598
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,700
s they are now in the white are stronger
than a week once

599
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,020
that's important are thing to keep in
mind when

600
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:27,020
talking about passwords good

601
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,480
yep

602
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,480
mmm

603
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:49,130
a group

604
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,790
its see

605
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,240
nope

606
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,240
you actual

607
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,140
all it probably will

608
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,180
and then the question is it's a is the
problem or

609
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,009
is the security added by the second
factor

610
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,589
out waiting P dropping Secunia password

611
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,710
up

612
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,810
yep yep

613
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,400
right right me

614
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,260
arm other interesting that's probably
known as the comparison we

615
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,440
myspace rock you and

616
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,920
carter's which are way the less secure
then

617
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,480
and those guys here Mongkok switches
more secure

618
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,730
you our strong set

619
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,240
it illustrates the important point that

620
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,140
Rockies reporters basically and its

621
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,200
weaker then what we experience in
practice

622
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,549
according to updated another

623
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,090
interesting graph is on possible reviews
we all know possibly use as bait

624
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,190
however some forms password

625
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,200
reuse are worse than others arm

626
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,960
reusing my password

627
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,650
on my one German newspaper on the other
chimneys paper and reading

628
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,040
is not a big deal I see personally some
might disagree but

629
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,720
that's a kinda tolerable former reuse

630
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,459
bat former reuse is reusing my banking

631
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:43,480
password on my on newspaper and this has
to better plan on its not really been

632
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,150
studied before there are

633
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,590
to kind of studies I'll going that
direction but here we have nice the to

634
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,960
arm blue line its reuse

635
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,220
in general overall passwords and

636
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,290
green is reusing financial

637
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,619
passwords on another site on the same
user

638
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,960
remember we have data from mall where
moreover captures

639
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,570
several passwords per user which puts us
in a kind of unique

640
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,220
situation here on the x-axis we have

641
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,069
normalized edit distance which means
that um

642
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,290
one is completely different and

643
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,640
0 is completely equal so if you're
looking at

644
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,839
equal so exact reuse me if those numbers
here

645
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,460
um reuse overall in blue

646
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,859
is about 14 percent and reuse of
financial passwords

647
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,250
on another site is about 20 percent

648
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,380
now have no idea like that practice
about the other

649
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,030
I would have hoped at least for been the
other way around

650
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,800
hope actually for that point here be it
but it's not

651
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,910
for whatever reason so people are

652
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,930
reusing their financial passwords on

653
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,690
other accounts on no value accounts in
this bed

654
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:09,380
course small

655
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,430
up right

656
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,589
great are they did a small here's even
slightly smaller because

657
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,910
we did have the case that for one user
fee only had a high value financial

658
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,529
password

659
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,570
so the actual number is even less yeah
but still

660
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,600
I mean 20 percent even if the error
margin is

661
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,319
10 percent we're still at least 10
percent

662
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,760
would it should definitely be 80

663
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,210
good

664
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,640
arm yep as anybody we are similar data
sets probably their

665
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,000
lots of motor comes bear does anybody
know

666
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,430
similar analysis of those the to faith

667
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,970
recent academic literature there's
nothing that's what I'm

668
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,720
pretty sure about anything else no

669
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:08,720
this is good and bad at the same time

670
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,860
if there's one by

671
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,020
knowing some bud

672
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,170
up

673
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:28,480
when I'm aware of that but

674
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,270
the word in plain their it to crack the
passwords

675
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,530
and so he didn't have all passwords yet
if

676
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,200
great that's the one paper um or in the
paper but the one who this is but I'm

677
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,200
aware of arm rules

678
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,510
from go

679
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:01,510
yep yep

680
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,150
there are plenty of numbers and password
to reuse

681
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:09,170
from surveys which is a good starting
point

682
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,700
which usually have similar numbers we
have about

683
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,759
questionnaires on possible route usage

684
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,920
are well not the best choice of
journalism

685
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,190
people tend to lie okay sleep

686
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:32,190
up

687
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,360
up

688
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:44,360
up

689
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:57,570
and we nicely see that by using the edit
distance here so we see how fast

690
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:03,940
similar views increased unfortunately
sup

691
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,990
yeah how data is limited that's why i'm
looking for.

692
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:12,689
for more on that data arm if it was
really interesting but limited

693
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,240
by the relatively small number of
initial password

694
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,240
good

695
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,990
oh yes last november you could tell you
better

696
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,620
a he would use well bad language for
describing that

697
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,029
me so to

698
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:40,060
as I said the data was collected by
israeli subdivision of an American

699
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,250
company and of course they were so they

700
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,320
to collect more data for helping their
customers

701
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,670
detect when passwords from their
organizational from the user's isley

702
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,510
arm of course they were

703
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,750
heavily worried about that beat up being
leaked somehow

704
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,600
arm that's why be didn't get the double
only access to the data

705
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,100
arm the several lakh in

706
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,980
whatever holes to try to prevent
expiration of the data

707
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,210
yeah whatever

708
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,200
um and it was a pain to work with
because

709
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,520
typically one of the machines crashed

710
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,070
during the analysis and then the
entirety gone

711
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:30,240
yeah that's why he's using foul language
described that

712
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,089
arm India ended walls arm

713
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,220
some database server and some unit she
next to it

714
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,100
that he produced a query you can expect
for state record all that

715
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,970
looked like a password to the other
machine and we have number scripts there

716
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,540
to run

717
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,680
that expected up

718
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,990
I'm not fully where more details the
requests for him

719
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,020
more mmm

720
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,190
all

721
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,250
K one more public to vote for the
authentication

722
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,490
I was a bit worried proposing that but
now that I've so the

723
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,509
web page says passwords only but we have
heard about talks before so I'm

724
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,190
but which too much I'm interested

725
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,890
good great arm I wonderful very

726
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,379
I what is for the authentication on if
you know

727
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,670
from you forget password issue security
talking's

728
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:34,790
and you cut your finger so that your
fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize any

729
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,259
more

730
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,200
this is bad for you need a way to regain
access to your account to reset your

731
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,890
password

732
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,700
there are many names for faulting of
indication account recovery secondary

733
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,490
authentication password reset

734
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,109
whatever you name it I and of course if
the account to cover is

735
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,720
less secure than the original motive of
indication that you take to protect it

736
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,180
so that's SBS to be secure um

737
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,359
you all know security questions of
course they are of course

738
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,410
not the best option we all

739
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,069
know that arm you can do it by email or
by S&S

740
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,920
email can of course not be used for your
email account is a fork of indication

741
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,080
because typical of success

742
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,610
thank you lost access arm SMS was not
really designed to be a secure service

743
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:26,000
and we see attacks on those recently up
but is still used and it's

744
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,400
propping up the worst option that you
can use by support team is pretty

745
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,360
expensive

746
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,030
but of use the last resort by using
another pass routes like people

747
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,760
for your mobile phones and social
authentication that's what I'm talking

748
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,360
about in a second there was a question

749
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:47,360
in the last row no okay

750
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:11,060
freakenspeak up a bit

751
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:27,670
I'm not to regain your biometrics but to
reset your by metrics for example I

752
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,189
guess

753
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:31,509
I haven't really thought about how your
resetting biometry to be

754
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:36,969
not easy but yeah unlock your account
may be setting a password

755
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:40,099
country whatever yup good point

756
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:44,019
but that's like to get in hurrrrr maybe
I was attracted by the kitten

757
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:47,569
are yep

758
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:51,519
arm sort of indication harder than it
looks

759
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,919
and that's what we experienced yes well
we

760
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,019
is in particular a shower on who wanted
to speak here but then have some bees

761
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,189
are related issues

762
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:06,469
and we couldn't come here so the next
with lights

763
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:11,839
are were basically done by him arm

764
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,078
sort of indication is authentication by

765
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:19,589
who you know a how it's often handled
for example Facebook

766
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:23,449
if you lost access to your account then
you can select

767
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:26,959
3 up your friends for your contacts

768
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:30,640
arm random codes are sent to go stand
you

769
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,749
phone them asking for the code and
entering

770
00:50:33,749 --> 00:50:37,879
week always to about former something if
those are correct

771
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,140
then you can reset your password or so i
mean they're 1 million variations of the

772
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,129
same my dear

773
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,439
arm but that's the basic idea now
there's an obvious

774
00:50:47,439 --> 00:50:50,709
attack arm if you can make

775
00:50:50,709 --> 00:50:53,919
the victim to accept three of your
contact request

776
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,309
which typically everybody's accepting

777
00:50:57,309 --> 00:51:01,039
you too small test and had a pretty high
turnout read

778
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,219
50 percent or so what's friend accepted
freak

779
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:09,039
request and then you can just as an
attacker

780
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,259
start the account recovery selecting
those friends that you control

781
00:51:13,259 --> 00:51:16,640
and then the whole system blows up which
is bed um

782
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,759
faith and come to american

783
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:23,979
use and that Facebook use you know
previous version

784
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:27,618
of a trusted friend apparently still use
um

785
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:31,989
you can only start the trusted friends
account recovery

786
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:35,059
if you have enough contacts arm

787
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:39,439
and probably also if enough context are
old enough

788
00:51:39,439 --> 00:51:42,848
if they're not only very new contact and
whatever it's not really clear what

789
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,549
they're doing

790
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:47,299
you talk to them and they revealed
something but not too much

791
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:52,279
um in then Facebook showing you the
first

792
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:58,619
step list of 100 sup list of your
friends size 100 you can select one

793
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,339
contact from that list then there
shortening the list

794
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:05,779
fifty-year select one from this smaller
set and then

795
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:09,170
their shortening again you have to
select one from last

796
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,019
25 business apparently done to prevent
the

797
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:17,038
attack from the for the first-line where
you are

798
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,189
just toes your contacts and if you have
enough contact to see

799
00:52:21,189 --> 00:52:26,160
300 then the probability that you were
control the Collins are in close up with

800
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,519
that should be pretty small and then
systems at least more secure than it was

801
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,089
before

802
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:35,319
problem was that Facebook

803
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,349
did not implement this correctly davis
played

804
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:42,920
the lists of the tracking this arm but
still

805
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,559
if you manipulated the headers to some
other tricks and some through some hoops

806
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,369
bandicoot in each those

807
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:51,779
steps select the context from the
tiredness to france

808
00:52:51,779 --> 00:52:55,729
are which the core spared because
welfare

809
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:58,739
understood that they should show you

810
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:02,559
sup list but if they still let select
your controlled accounts from

811
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,469
entire set of conduct then you're across
the bed situation

812
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:09,719
and it broke the of indication
completely

813
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:14,239
arm last time I spoke to us are he told
me that now

814
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,039
they improved it by only letting you
selected

815
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:23,209
from for 100 contact from the first step

816
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:27,959
but each of the three steps so if you
get you three context in that

817
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:31,578
smaller sums to you then you're still
good from if you don't

818
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:35,749
danger of coat got better i three
contacted them but still not

819
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:39,678
not perfect questions

820
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,650
yes

821
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,369
up

822
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:54,369
yep

823
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:59,579
up

824
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:05,109
so you're asking if they're more sites
that might be

825
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:09,400
spectacle to a similar attack among the
thing is not so many sites are

826
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,249
implementing

827
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:13,799
social authentication because in that so
many sites having

828
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:17,479
a friend list years arm he was

829
00:54:17,479 --> 00:54:22,948
serving couple 50% of social networks
and Facebook was the only one

830
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:26,140
implementing really sort of indication
from those

831
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:31,089
arm if you are aware of more sites using

832
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:34,140
social authentication in a similar way
to hear

833
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,339
I'd be interested to hear so for
authentication

834
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:44,339
anyone

835
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:52,900
up

836
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:59,609
right

837
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:04,328
I'm eating I'm eating a lot of details
when you get here that's just the basic

838
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:06,849
idea he also called a couple of help
desks and

839
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:11,619
got a couple of password resets that you
should not have gone

840
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:15,029
the interesting even he up Houston

841
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:18,869
email address that was clearly from
another guy had keenan name

842
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:21,929
I in was not the name that he claims to
be

843
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:26,069
and you want to pass reset for another
person and you got it

844
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:30,999
you but im trying too hard

845
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:34,049
and also admitted that he found a nice
way to

846
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:37,288
people sending out a couple of emails
for

847
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,859
making everybody aware of that and
account recovery is going on but you

848
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:41,709
could

849
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:45,190
dropped the names of your contacts from
most be missed by many predicting the

850
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,119
headers

851
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:49,759
and they didn't check server-side those
reform correctly

852
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,549
have other nice things

853
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:57,420
up

854
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:04,420
yep great I'm not surprised
unfortunately

855
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,770
good I think I'm not close to one our

856
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,680
arm if you want I can briefly

857
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,879
tell you something what and where
parents against the passwords but so

858
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,560
interesting

859
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,750
your okay I'm 100 quickly there quite
many slides and times

860
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,940
we started it faster I should have put a
kitten here but instead it put

861
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,020
I can win back but who actually did

862
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:35,020
at least half a rooted in presenting the
next lights from PhD student go home

863
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,070
I'm you all I guess you're on the go
Android

864
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:42,200
kaczynski the graphical passwords came
from for Android you can skip it

865
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,700
just let's say it's a respected very end
of the POSCO scheme POSCO

866
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,080
returnees bigger had less restrictions
arm

867
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:55,360
enright restricted for visibility in for
some other reasons I have no idea why

868
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,690
they did it

869
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,170
for example I have no idea why you
cannot

870
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:04,600
commit appoint from online why you
cannot visit a point

871
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,580
twice thing is all these restrictions
restrict you too

872
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,390
a written a number three and 89120 of
possible patterns

873
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,890
on and there would be many more if you
didn't have to strict but still the high

874
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,670
number is completely irrelevant

875
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:22,270
because users don't to his uniform
patterns from the entire set of possible

876
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:22,930
parents

877
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,770
but as your own well aware of their
choosing patterns from us

878
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,990
more restricted set and

879
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:33,470
the question we had was how r restricted
state

880
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,910
we all expected happens to be week but
the question is

881
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:43,240
how weak Rd actually possible patterns

882
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,879
300 89102 there's no way to calculate
that number you just enumerate them

883
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,730
using smalls

884
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:54,600
and then you're done the selection
process the Wii U that there's no way to

885
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,339
sense country arm

886
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,660
so talking about the security of

887
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,839
patterns you have to have patterns of
course there's no list of patterns

888
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,140
there so we had to create one so we did
you study

889
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,000
asking for parents now you study on
passwords

890
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,410
or patterns you have the option to ask

891
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:22,109
user for his actual password or pattern
which is a bad idea for a number of

892
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:22,760
reasons

893
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,530
um you can ask them to trust

894
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:30,840
create an account on your machine system
throughway account and then whatever

895
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,410
um there's also a bad idea because then
they which was a very weak or

896
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:38,770
there's the risk the people to the very
password or a very strong want us to

897
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,330
rent one so you wanna make them to
recall the password

898
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:46,840
after some time after half an hour or so
then they will choose a very weak one

899
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,380
because they have to recall that

900
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,730
arm so what do you do if the balance

901
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,300
the incentives for choosing week and
strong patterns or password that's what

902
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:57,800
we did

903
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,840
by going to our men's I'm ball home

904
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,890
and playing a game with them when they

905
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:07,950
entered men's up heading for for lunch

906
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:12,089
we offered them some chocolate bars

907
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,220
but not directly but they could to
create an account on an Android phone

908
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,459
using the unlock scheme so they had to

909
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,600
lock your account with the pattern and
then

910
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,610
after lunch they're coming back the
reproducing the

911
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,850
pattern so unlocking the account and
ending at the top bar

912
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,020
good that disincentive

913
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:36,110
for choosing week patterns because if
they reproduces correctly then take it

914
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:36,870
apart

915
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:40,140
for this reason we gave them an
incentive to choose

916
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,400
stronger patterns by telling them

917
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,800
I don't be telling them but we did it
arm dat

918
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,460
they are also attacking the accounts

919
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,640
from the users before so they

920
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,060
chose their own petr banditos five
patterns

921
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,640
attacking that previously created
accounts and likewise

922
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,029
the guy standing behind him in line they
take their pattern

923
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:07,890
and whoever broke a pattern from

924
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:11,790
somebody else got their chocolate bar
and when they came back

925
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:15,450
and nobody broke their account then they
got the chocolate bar

926
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,580
meeting and you see that kind of
balances

927
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:24,259
probably best too much in the direction
of strong patterns

928
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,530
arm with a short pen paper study on

929
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,800
an actual patterns and patterns
officials here a bit longer

930
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,470
and the other patterns so probably the
data that we have

931
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,850
is slightly stronger than the reality

932
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:42,110
yes I P stronger than the reality arm

933
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,640
but as we are set out to show that there
will be it's good if we have

934
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,859
stronger than reality patterns and if
those are weak then the real ones are

935
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,470
even bigger

936
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,490
also discussed two sets

937
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:56,770
of patterns defensive these are

938
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,350
patterns that it rose to protect their
account

939
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,930
and the offensive those are the ones
that the use to

940
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:08,480
attack other accounts and expected those
are weaker than

941
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,510
candles but we'll see in a second that
the breakdown we had one hundred

942
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:17,500
rear 113 participants in that first part
as expected

943
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,850
the starting point is bias to the upper
left

944
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:25,470
from the transitions are mostly on the
outer side of the rectangle

945
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,000
if you go the middle does not be most
frequent 15

946
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,410
three grams so three consecutive points
whatever arm

947
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:37,529
then be use Markov models to model and
attack based on the limited

948
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:40,880
training data that we had tested a
couple

949
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,340
of parameters whatever and that's the
first interesting slide

950
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:49,100
this is the actual attack against the
patterns that we had

951
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,529
good how to read that of course on the
right hand a

952
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:55,700
Texas this he's the number of guessing
aka

953
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,069
guessing attempts that predated guessing
success one here

954
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:05,080
green Rd defensive patterns red are the
offense the parents of the green ones

955
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,710
are the interesting ones

956
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:09,940
and the true curve

957
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:13,800
its probably slightly about the green
probably between the green and the red

958
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,750
one except the green ones are slightly
stronger

959
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,000
that the true patterns a reference we
have

960
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,680
the guessing success for random

961
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,970
three and four digit PIN so if you're
choosing pins

962
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,589
randomly uniformly not user chosen

963
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,850
arm and of course for 32 pins with

964
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:37,960
1000 getting a tendency of successfully
1 and with five thousand

965
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:42,420
for Ford exp injures if success rate of
50 percent

966
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,380
and you can see that for a small number
of getting attempts

967
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:53,380
even the defensive pairings are weaker
than randomly told 32 pins

968
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,470
intersected

969
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:04,540
interesting on interesting is the
following point

970
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:07,640
arm let's say if you are

971
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,000
doing so on the Android devices number
of attempts to imitate

972
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,800
the

973
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:21,800
sexual I

974
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:29,310
no I don't know because that's the point
this

975
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,820
pressure was not really fixed it depends
on the Android version

976
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:38,090
arm one version that we had allowed 30
attempts

977
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:41,210
so other things the crossing point here
is not interesting

978
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:45,150
arm interesting is for 30 attempts

979
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:50,870
what is your get things yes or for $100
depending on your Android version I

980
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:54,520
paying for 38 seven or eight percent

981
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,860
arm yeah but but on the entire occur

982
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:05,860
if you're feeling on Howard outwards
doctor

983
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:13,529
yes that's how to read at some point
degrees in here in that region

984
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:16,970
it's definitely less secure than a 3 did

985
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,529
pin uniformly chosen ideal we did

986
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:27,529
yeah hip

987
01:04:28,779 --> 01:04:33,039
is not about

988
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,680
this not about fairness I'm this yeah

989
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,980
no I but we're betting that obvious but

990
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,730
no a we're not comparing the security of
pins and your

991
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:50,250
patterns why we're showing that lines
here is for

992
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:55,579
reference because for the children with
Olympians are to be used for looking at

993
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:55,990
them

994
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:59,399
carts often forget banking cards

995
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,680
now banking's our banks are allowing
user chosen pins as well but it's a bad

996
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,200
idea

997
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,788
it seems that four-digit pin

998
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:12,000
are accepted as the reasonable

999
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,470
security measure against on bankers
again on the guessing attacks

1000
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:20,098
that's why we're showing showing that
line here given the fact that this is

1001
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:23,789
way less secure than this line you're
signing deadline as well for

1002
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:27,690
seeing where's the point so we're not
saying that parents are

1003
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:32,170
better than pin numbers or something you
say user

1004
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,170
chosen patterns are worse then

1005
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:40,130
uniform pin numbers that also is showing

1006
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:45,190
and computed entropy numbers here is the
entropy for what he said

1007
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:49,339
uniformly toes and patterns but nobody
will enter you from ito's pattern

1008
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:54,089
I can assure you on uniformly talking
parents are pretty good

1009
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:58,490
their 389,000 whatever

1010
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:02,558
um thats more secure dad and 62 pins

1011
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,259
which would be fair yeah

1012
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:10,539
entropy this is how entropies calculated
whatever

1013
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:14,579
arm not given that here the results are
kind of bad we looked at

1014
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:18,559
can we improve on the situation can be a
small the relations of the original

1015
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,299
scheme

1016
01:06:19,299 --> 01:06:23,950
are maybe more security came up with the
following four variations

1017
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:29,129
top left point was the most frequent
starting point to be left out

1018
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:32,339
arm for forcing the users to

1019
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:35,599
start somewhere else unfortunate but
started the top middle point

1020
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,960
up bender

1021
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,220
adding two more points because here's on
the eight point it was whiskey

1022
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,279
nine points you 10 points let's see what
happens

1023
01:06:45,279 --> 01:06:49,079
referendum arrangement also without a
clear top left point

1024
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:53,250
on also hear more parents are possible
because

1025
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,829
no straight-line a fling three is a
minute

1026
01:06:56,829 --> 01:07:00,170
as it is here and here and we have a
circular arrangement

1027
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:06,220
just for fun you never know yep we read

1028
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:09,779
there's just the opposite

1029
01:07:09,779 --> 01:07:13,710
we didn't ask for nationality of our
participants

1030
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,869
unfortunately otherwise we probably
would if the

1031
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:20,539
would have seen that in the data but yep
that's the

1032
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:24,309
what we expect at least arm

1033
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:28,019
repeating the entire process

1034
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:31,399
again 366 more participants

1035
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,009
the chocolate bars both of them to cut
all mmm

1036
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,220
and that's the result um the

1037
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,680
lech curve is the defensive patterns
from the previous

1038
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,160
lied the red line here is the

1039
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,328
left out small so with out the top left
point they're less points so it's less

1040
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:49,970
secure

1041
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:54,169
we've seen that quite clearly arm

1042
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:59,130
the left out large with more points with
the green cover

1043
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:03,220
slightly more secure but not that much
interesting is the

1044
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,308
random arrangement the orange line which

1045
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:11,619
is one overtime the orange line is it's
really insecure here

1046
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:14,910
I'm a trip you can see it least secure
one

1047
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:18,089
even tho it looks pretty looks pretty
good right arm

1048
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:24,408
whites that if any idea why the random
pattern is

1049
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:27,408
is really weak yep

1050
01:08:27,408 --> 01:08:31,179
at the Delta right

1051
01:08:31,179 --> 01:08:35,279
good we didn't spot it when we decide
the scheme quite a number of people

1052
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,730
thought that are here

1053
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:41,309
arm ornate or attended the storm here or
something

1054
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:45,339
for the things the human brains good in
fine structure with there's no structure

1055
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:48,568
arm and they found that the rent was a
pretty bad idea

1056
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:53,040
yep just that one for all

1057
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,299
for being a parable because they're
taking other random patterns

1058
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:59,689
we could not create a new one but in
general

1059
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:03,178
having random arrangement seems bad
because yup

1060
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:08,440
depth that's what happened with arm

1061
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:12,759
surprisingly the best one was the
circular arrangement which was better

1062
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:14,810
than the original scheme of the entire

1063
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,370
line here and it's better by more than a
bitch

1064
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:23,238
so at least doubling the expected number
of Cassius

1065
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:27,358
with surprising because it is something
up same number of points it's just

1066
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,299
basically moving be explains towards the
center

1067
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:34,750
and that makes people create stronger
patterns

1068
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,359
for whatever reason we were a bit
worried that a lot of people are

1069
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,219
choosing

1070
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:43,500
circles but they didn't because probably
realized it wrong so it is a bad idea

1071
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,279
it's clearly in secure arm so

1072
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,739
yep circles are pretty good

1073
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:54,620
and that'd thank you upon have to be
over time but get a choice

1074
01:09:54,620 --> 01:10:01,620
so you it or not

1075
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:07,500
up

1076
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:14,500
yep no

1077
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,920
yep that probably was a factor so the

1078
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,340
comment was that in the circular
arrangement you have more neighbors to

1079
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,250
choose from

1080
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:40,389
arm and that's probably exactly what
happens

1081
01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:44,190
arm on the other hand the random

1082
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:47,839
arrangements there are two more
neighbors arm

1083
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,820
and more notary to sign the rental
arrangement

1084
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,159
every node is reachable the thats

1085
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:58,290
of course but north of course here

1086
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:02,769
that point is not reachable from that
point if this has not been corrected

1087
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,110
before

1088
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:07,949
here there's no straight lines so every
point is reachable from every other

1089
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:08,678
point

1090
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:13,310
that's how we it was one thing that we
imposed on the structure

1091
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:17,080
I'm here it's only that point that can
be in the way

1092
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,630
and I can tell you a lot of people which
owns Mike

1093
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:24,659
squares that square arms are you square

1094
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:28,929
and got to the middle so that yup just
easier to

1095
01:11:28,929 --> 01:11:35,929
select other points yeah

1096
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:45,800
I'm in addition you

1097
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:55,860

you

1100
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:41,440
okay for you set that the principle of
proximity explains

1101
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,950
at least those two when property of the
other yeah

1102

I think that it's a wonderful thank you
for that comment which

1103
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:55,180
talk more about that today or later and
it's fantastic one question

1104
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:59,380

certain here because that's the most

1105
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,690
proximate one

1106
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:07,690

here yeah on for at great I

1111
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,490
but that the computer science wing

1112
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:56,280
doing it great thank you
