1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,460
up okay so new insights into pink coach

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,119
and I asked you yesterday

3
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,420
right down gender for the japan that you
think you would be able to remember a

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,460
month from now on

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,400
for the japan that you think you will
not be able to remember them off now or

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,410
and also some in the Japan but you think
you would be able to

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,739
remember animal lower now hours

8
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,739
thinking about giving you paper notes
now

9
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,739
and ask you to see if you can remember
early

10
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:49,190
in court so you made yesterday because
I'm that I can make a comparison

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,519
I'll I'll refrain from doing that now

12
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,710
I will do much talking that but

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,370
yep

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,780
correct other side work in progress

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,060
I but again

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,260
a I have done this little experiment

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,560
with different groups the first one did
with

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,470
morse 26 PhD students out to ponder
force

19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,929
at fencer I a research course

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,340
into information security this spring
and I lost

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,640
I was asking people to you know agenda

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,200
and these 3 pin codes and this is one of
the notes I received when I did

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,439
this with are large group of 17-year-old
teenagers

24
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,059
I it's its its kinda fun to not only get
the

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,350
be a dipping coach to

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,219
but the cute little doodles us well up
for it to end this for seventeen so I

27
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,658
know

28
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,600
its it economy it freaks me out a little
bit

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,899
I but the at

30
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,219
a.m. with the students in in total hi
I'm

31
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,649
a at university there I even received

32
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,030
a No with male and you have a really
cute but

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,940
written on the back of it another

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,609
up on for but a again kinda fun I'm even
in this audience

35
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,610
and even though I did say four digits
for the Jets and seven digits

36
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,640
I was still to people in the audience
who'd

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,059
failed to to write it down correctly

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,060
there's always somebody

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,890
a make a small mistake even up

40
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,019
you also in need pretty much the the
mandatory

41
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,610
xkcd comic strip somewhere

42
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,080
and so many good ones

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
and the closest I could get Japan while
searching yesterday was

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,240
pretty much this wall which is kinda fun

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,420
but it's not really that related to two
my talk

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,420
today still likes what our way

47
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,810
Hestia

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,750
interesting stuff and this is

49
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,140
also the back row 44 what I'm I have
been your remember rock you

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,339
I want the thing start they did the
Cambridge job 10

51
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,520
and others is not they extracted from
the rock your passwords the

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,060
extracted all four-digit pins

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,580
if you wanna call it that from password

54
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,840
in the rock you list I'm quite quite a
few of them

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,540
and you also have the sky over New York
about developer named

56
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,829
duniya amitai and he

57
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,000
made an application for iPhone couple
years ago named Big Brother

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,450
and in the application he made a lock
screen

59
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,780
that was that looked us much as possible

60
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,120
a us the original iPhone lockscreen

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,980
on the of people to hunter of four digit
PIN

62
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,230
to protect the application what he
didn't tell people is that he collected

63
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,850
those

64
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,159
and coats and something back himself and
he was able to collect approximately 225

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,250
house in different

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,680
for digital somewhat different 225 house
open calls from people

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,210
before somebody actually discover what
was going on and up a block application

68
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,039
from the

69
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,188
from from there up stop and

70
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,860
though state I'll I mean I have also
lost him for them I and

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,580
I got them from him but gingrich did I
keep me up all those as well

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,550
up you can see they are pretty similar
and

73
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,560
after seeing this I have my good friend
on

74
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,710
colleague on of value of public and when
I will I need something to be coded

75
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,818
because I have this

76
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,629
on you crazy idea on something I want
allies is the I'm talking to you

77
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:05,680
usually and I told him about this

78
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,990
heatmaps and he said I gotta do
something

79
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,349
some lot like that and the next morning
he said I have a better option for you

80
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:14,120
go try it out

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,389
along going to sleep now looks like this

82
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,439
so what we did these are from passwords

83
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,710
the soap in coach collected from iPhones

84
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,530
and peace are for the dipping coach
collected for fiscal access control

85
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,169
system

86
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,758
and wherever you are working or go to
school if they are you sing for the

87
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,080
shipping costs in fiscal access control
system

88
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,740
there's a very high probability about
physical access control system

89
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,719
is storing all the PIN code in plain
text in the system

90
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,498
because it's ok close system even though
it's running away from a

91
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:55,520
I collecting hundreds maybe thousands of
different

92
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,628
ax card terminals they still considered
to be a closed system

93
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,879
and a pink or similar usually I mean
when was the last time you change your

94
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,099
four digit PIN

95
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,729
when you are call the work

96
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,810
the course a pin code to me it's a
password

97
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,379
and according to your password policy
you should change your poss world

98
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:22,080
every 36 United ace but I'm pretty sure
you haven't changed out for the Japan

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,169
in the last 90 days

100
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,909
and not only that but in many many cases
are also being told by people lot

101
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:33,270
they can go to you the hall reception
site

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,520
I forgot my pin code and the operator
will tell you

103
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,520
your PIN code so they can see your PIN
code on screen

104
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:48,740
so we extracted a nice little amount of

105
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,719
pin codes generated heat map

106
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:56,060
looks like this and we see parts of the
same powers

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,039
how to explain these

108
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,949
the horse ok the line is the two first
digits occupant coat

109
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,090
diverticulitis the lost two-digit

110
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,289
so this essay or share 0 share 0 share 0
9999

111
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,539
1111 2222 3333

112
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,349
outsole yeah this line

113
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,529
its 19 something

114
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,979
so like in fifty sixty seventy eighty

115
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,639
ninety like that

116
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,370
the doctor the blue s the more popular
pincode

117
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,219
and this specific blocker its debts

118
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:42,840
essentially what that job on your phone
out a Cambridge

119
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,479
it start some well I'm I don't remember
the exact number but

120
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,688
looked something like seventy eighty
percent to Los

121
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,110
will if you allow to pick your own
four-digit pin

122
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,330
you will choose one out of only 100

123
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,650
and coach or us they also said im this
long

124
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,058
is 9 percent chance that I will be able
to guess

125
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,099
based on pure statistics on without me
unintelligible you

126
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,469
at all except for the fact that I think
all know what you up

127
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:15,129
picture own in cold this nine percent
chance I would be able to get your PIN

128
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:18,699
three attempts

129
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,919
knots a little higher than I would have
Fox

130
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,109
so this is possibly background when I
did this

131
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,310
and then also you have to set the
genetics

132
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,919
which is also interesting the have also
been looking into the same stuff he has

133
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,819
a really

134
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,630
longer post this is just the
parliament's and he's

135
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,120
have made X-ray pictures of the heat map

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,290
there you can see very clear block

137
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,410
paddles

138
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,500
I shouldn't say he should be more
because it's not but

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,620
its you can see very clearly though

140
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,830
blocks in this I'm here can see even
bother the

141
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,020
dates and year patterns

142
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,060
and there's lots more interesting stuff
in this proposed on

143
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,430
how people have selected the sprinkles

144
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,530
relate to progressively leading digits a
flexible

145
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,100
now fuckin 2010 December 2010 we had
Howard Smith

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,610
from or kill cooperation in the UK here

147
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,880
and he was talking about users selection
of

148
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,439
kinko's this is the YouTube video the

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,470
available so everybody can listen to it
so

150
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,680
talk for forty minutes and

151
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,949
they didn't just look into for the Japan
course they're also made some attempts

152
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,360
or with people selecting long open
courses well to see

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,900
can we in some way predict what kinda
can coax

154
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,020
they will sucks if they allowed to do so

155
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,990
and the result saw pretty much as
expected

156
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,800
people do not use random can coach

157
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,430
so toted you should have a look at

158
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,109
so back to this research course up fence
up

159
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,240
as a Sat 26 people there

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,660
PHD's and professors mostly in
photography

161
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,510
and

162
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,660
minutes it's not up much about

163
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,390
populated hits map but this is

164
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,920
be memorable been coached chosen by lot
those

165
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,360
I can't see a gun here's the lower left
bloc

166
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,040
if we go to be random the picture
changes

167
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,410
and essentially people are moving away
from the lower left bloc

168
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,630
that's the very simple pattern to spot

169
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,700
but if you go for the seven digit
memorable it looks like

170
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,700
trip it's just gather over

171
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,690
you can also look at at it this way

172
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,160
these our digital distribution in
memorable for the defense

173
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,189
the most popular 0 digit s

174
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,340
to and the listed this problem digit

175
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,520
sex

176
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,750
in a memorable what's

177
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,110
and if you look at the poor random

178
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,670
Siro is a number that this apparently
easy to remember

179
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,040
so they won't be using that because this
is supposed to be a pin code out this

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,040
not to be my mobile

181
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,390
and looking at the sudden again

182
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,500
still suddenly yep six ago richest

183
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,490
you're supposed to it's ok supposed to
be memorable don't you six

184
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,590
it's not supposed to be memorable your
cerro

185
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,910
us one of you that it's

186
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,699
and these are you guys

187
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,199
false sorry so thats

188
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,589
answer

189
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,520
up on your own top so yep

190
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,430
help has cancer are you guys you guys
are weird

191
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,250
but

192
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,440
kinda fun to see a who would who like to
meet

193
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,950
into the seven digit PIN code a house in
24

194
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,910
256 raise your hand that we are

195
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,620
up so what you create a bear is
Association element I guess

196
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,800
you didn't pick 1,024

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,959
256 randomly so you have an
associational not

198
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,220
which iz rather easy for us to figure
out

199
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,730
I hope but this is what we look like

200
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,010
answers are so so was this what

201
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,210
well

202
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,710
34 1234 up or

203
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,160
that's on the year like an 84

204
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,329
who is born in 1984 no to people how I
guess

205
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,500
one that your front

206
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,920
does your session on a map there go for

207
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,920
that very have your session Association
elements also for the seven digits

208
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,040
was also power to see now

209
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,209
let's have the 17-year-old teenager
since this makes

210
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,410
and talk you guys

211
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:05,439
fence up

212
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,130
and how you have a four digit memorable
pin codes

213
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,570
made by 17-year-old teenagers again

214
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,890
concentration in Lowell asked

215
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,439
but still pretty much got out but you're
so warm

216
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,470
Radwan seventeen-year-olds

217
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,960
1984 Bates

218
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,380
yet of I am NOT sir

219
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,250
Butler they have them

220
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,430
I didn't have a

221
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,939
bring her but the on this one there was
a 193

222
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,770
teenagers in in the room boys and girls

223
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,530
pretty much like 60/40 percent max

224
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,699
and I was

225
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,380
kind of looking out the crowd I'm
thinking about to cry

226
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,650
could be interesting to see if the
differences between

227
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,670
boys and girls so in the very last
minute the

228
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,620
of them to write I'll male or female and
there's a difference between

229
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,910
watching girls inspecting ankles the
most

230
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,480
pop lockin call for girls most a certain
might not for my in

231
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,610
party sick 17-year-old yeah but from
voice

232
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,640
the yet of both was the second-most

233
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,360
common pin what you think the

234
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,980
v most common four digit PIN code wats

235
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,980
for 17-year-old boys

236
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,840
one 337 come on guys wake up

237
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,550
lead to polls and the funny thing is
that

238
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,520
leets 1337 was the most popular

239
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,569
pincode selected by the boys but there
wasn't a single goal

240
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,100
who selected 1337 a serpent code

241
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,540
you don't play computer games online I
guess

242
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,250
no well its well if you look at

243
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,360
the digits 1337 you can read 'em

244
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,030
ask al ET Lee I'm not short of

245
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,240
elite which is a word being used by

246
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
game loss a lot online to say that

247
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,960
you know you rule really cool you like
elite

248
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,960
you're really good yeah also

249
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,630
that yeah mmm

250
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,960
I yep

251
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,960
may be there as well levels the four
digit memorable

252
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:03,960
now looking at the random it really also
change us

253
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,869
they're moving away from the lower left
moving no

254
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,889
up into the Jets

255
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,250
an interesting thing of course they
start

256
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,319
if you think they are created their own
for the Japan called

257
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,409
based on the Cambridge research again

258
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,709
you have a list of 100 and Colts but you
should try out

259
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,310
first I'm if you know anything about the
personal

260
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,620
DataPro yell

261
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,699
stuff like that are useful to know

262
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,110
no unreal to

263
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,020
a seven digit memorable I think the
powder is pretty easy to spot

264
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:55,020
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 period

265
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,629
and I was the same thing with both boys
and girls

266
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,040
now I i have the state on five

267
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,070
I'm column willing to share them if
somebody would like to

268
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,210
look into them but I actually think when
I'm looking at the seven digit

269
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,790
pincode selected by these teenagers I
think that I'm

270
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,240
actually looking out caps a

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,580
phone numbers or both sites

272
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,639
missing one digit way to ensure all
social security numbers

273
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,390
most probably phone numbers ep

274
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:39,169
the whole culture

275
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,360
I couple yeah I can a lot

276
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,290
I'm you made it two or so so

277
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,909
I'm also to me it's also very important
to put things into context i mean

278
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,330
guessing in coats yeah fun you supported
Japan Co

279
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,620
maybe not such so smart but I'll be
using this slide

280
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,059
and telling people that us no assume us
read on for today

281
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,100
go back home talk to your kids talk you
teenagers talk yourself

282
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,219
right I'll let's talk all the

283
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,470
up that you have installed on your
iPhone or Android phone even

284
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,130
Windows Phone or iPod and make a note
next to them

285
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,429
in this application I have Store
financial bait about myself

286
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,040
and this application I have stalled
personal like

287
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,200
health information about myself and for
this application

288
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,809
I need a password for this morning the
PIN code this doesn't require

289
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,850
anything at all this of force

290
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,449
or requires two factor authentication if
you make that list

291
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,730
because you haven't done so before
you're probably in a standout

292
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,010
at least you need a to use a Ford
pincode maybe should have something

293
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,910
better than that

294
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,540
and all they have already talked about

295
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,360
the our cloud and maybe it's not so
smart to use lots of either

296
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,500
because configurations for wireless
networks everything

297
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,450
cam all-wheel weekends for work will
eventually end up

298
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:16,450
in that keychain being uploaded some of
these

299
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,130
of course some sort of two-factor
authentication

300
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,150
some of them require a key factor
authentication

301
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,980
but all in all money off them I'll just
use that password

302
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,710
or not anything at all pretty much but
still you might have

303
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,169
may have information stored in that that
could be

304
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:41,600
sensitive to you so

305
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,610
we saw haps about

306
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,100
we expect fifty percent of all

307
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,668
our transactions in 2020 to be

308
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,760
more wide you sing

309
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,790
small tablet a wearable

310
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:05,790
electro jackets some

311
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,960
the Financial Supervisory Authority of
Norway ace

312
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,220
word they are saying that in 2014 next
year

313
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,620
when they will do their annual risk
analysis

314
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,489
they will be focusing on mobility the
use of

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,990
through all of them

361
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,970
but in that context you're talking about
a target

362
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,150
talk against the bank more or less for
somebody have got accessed through the

363

hashing cryptid or plain text PIMCO's

364
00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:00,270
who

365
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,900
up sup

366
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,590
ep there but I mean

367
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:17,090
my own personal bank I'm using all my
primary bank

368
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,570
I have their mo but bike application on

number in no way it's not a secret

371
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,280
it's a simple formula I if you can
figure out

372
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,110
my they are both and the almost ball

373
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,750
than you could calculate all the
possible

374
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,280
social security numbers to I might have
and in my case

375
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,330
are under a hundred and two different
what's

376
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,129
and then you need to find a shows online
where you can verify if this is

377
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,770
a real social security number or not and

378
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,210
those so sis country up here from time
to time

379
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,410
I can do that chicken easley find my
search

380
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,590
social security number next challenge is

381
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,449
on my phone a four digit PIN and I got

382
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,950
to pick my own pin code by my back and
the interesting thing is

383
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,750
I of them you do not permit me to use

384
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,790
anything I'm still afford it and why not

385
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,440
welcome to use a six digit PIN why
proper use a password

386
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,200
why can't I use the levitating
businessman

387
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,930
I come from you Nicole southern past my
password

388
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,940
and their response force

389
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,940
we haven't we heard from mother

390
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,910
are we don't like the fact that a lot of
people talking about

391
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,110
we need to get rid of passwords but to
me

392
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,189
we are seeing a trend where we are
moving away from

393
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,020
passwords going back to pin codes again
because

394
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,120
everything is going mobile I'd and all
cell phones

395
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,090
muscles we prefer to use for the japan's

396
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,480
lots of people you probably know
somebody as well

397
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,130
they don't use of even for the Japan on
the social that's not like

398
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,630
tone that correct direction i'm open

399
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,860
so this to me

400
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,250
it's not good interesting thing again

401
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,350
if you think about to risk analysis from
the bank

402
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,929
perspective what they will say it's not

403
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,660
well this is the marketing sales
department

404
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,070
that does to risk analysis or they will

405
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,179
say us template for risk assess

406
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,350
is pretty simple either people

407
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,699
will be using ok ready call well they

408
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,830

making an appearance at all

410

411
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,680
if they use our called we are willing to
accept a certain risks associated with

412
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,190
fraud people giving away to pin cold

413
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,470
your sister people writing on a pin code
and storing it

414
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,750
on the backside of to call you are
loaded the simple tricked-out

415
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,080
on on your on your visa column masako
should write on the four digit PIN code

416
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,689
but not the one that is applicable to
call a course because if somebody steals

417
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,120
your call they were saying oh %um

418
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,949
absolutely stupid India so they will

419
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,870
tried out four digit PIN code your
verdict on the call and when that page

420
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,570
they only have two accounts left

421
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,220
to get shipping called simple trick on
my

422

Lexus tablet on my lockscreen I have
several pit
