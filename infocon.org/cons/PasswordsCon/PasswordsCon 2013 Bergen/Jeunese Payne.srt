1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,950
so

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,890
up years

3
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,529
was with us im up

4
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,910
well your he sorry

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,890
good up

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,890
ladies word

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,200
said

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
all wife

9
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,039
all I'm up

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,940
also novel

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,230
all style

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,828
this them she's

13
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,829
shows up

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,330
up

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,500
yes a the up

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,470
so me I can't say it as pair

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,420
already said I'm Denise and I'm not a
computer scientist and a psychologist

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,670
my undergraduate degrees in psychology
my he wasn't quite psychology human

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,990
computer interaction

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,670
and I now work with up to stand on
colleagues on fumes over there

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,110
Chris I'm at the University of Cambridge

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,439
am on the pick-up project and the
problem that we're trying to sell

23
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,600
and how to you

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,789
replace passwords because a very complex

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,820
and very many of them space environment

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,919
site was gonna move on site

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,969
by far the most dominant form
authentication

28
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,189
and passwords in this is fine in
principle

29
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,419
his pic 1password and

30
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,780
but the fact is thats and said pass it
has to be easier

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,190
and hassen and it for people to use and
it shouldn't be

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,800
reusable but people do you get reuse and
the me

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,020
of the pic quite complicated ones but
the fact

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,610
I so I'm that means that possible to

35
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,230
become impractical for me ability them
point and vulnerable to attack from

36
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,510
security standpoint

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,340
nice and obvious I usability

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,349
challenges with passwords

39
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,510
instant you have to have a different
password free to come and by

40
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,870
should be sufficiently long and complex
when

41
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,220
a combination numbers symbols lettin

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,739
so I'm say moreover

43
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,060
because users tend to be an actor about
their sections a security

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,780
they tend to you undermined system
security by cheating customers

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,940
a very trackable and say this is because
unlike typical

46
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,069
computer geek much you guys here and

47
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,390
typically user values usability more
than

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,819
Valley security side performing Forrest

49
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,790
I'm gonna D thirty seconds T try
memorize this

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,790
12 letter sequence here you ready

51
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,700
they write it down don t good

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,399
don't take picture I'm

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,400
him

54
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,119
okay set we've established what the main
issues Apple about the Y

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,230
I thought by selling some psychological
issues

56
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,510
and that underlie white cheeses uses
cheese cheeses

57
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,760
why his t's passwords that I'm

58
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,950
are weak and band weekend

59
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,720
caps lies on the committee's wrong
working against them and these other

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,870
psychological phenomena

61
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,910
I'm gonna talk about not the only
psychological I could talk about I'm and

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,359
they are

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,840
quite closely related and that I think
mice

64
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,078
relevant hearing Severson

65
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,389
ask if you can tell me what the problem
secret letters I ask you to remember was

66
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:31,229
may become I'm gonna go you first hear
first hand up

67
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,229
yes site

68
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:39,599
how did you remember that now you said

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,979
what did you say ed yet

70
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,930
yes correct I am so how did you remember
that want to deter

71
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,630
mmm would

72
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,700
writes a used and technical

73
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,840
have which is down here

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,020
contextual suggesting someone gets out
describe that site

75
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,680
and you nevertheless like found it
difficult made it correctly

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,210
I'm sure other people to contain and the
difficulty difficulty

77
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,479
like experienced turnaround for the
sequence is very much

78
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm online how the human mind works in
particular how working memory works

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,750
and working memory there the problem
with partisan

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,680
length but their complexity which means
that

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,289
an where mine

82
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,700
I don't want my

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,080
doing saws I'm in the right place now

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,849
sorry I got last and K okay so ideally
there should be no worse consisting

85
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,060
random sequences

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,610
I love letters numbers and symbols and
so that they're not gettable a brief

87
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,110
possible

88
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,919
and there too and main

89
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,049
methods for trying to recall a sequence

90
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,000
are items that make up words and the
first is changing where US Special

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,729
each item each item Kings the next item

92
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,789
and got context of the situation where

93
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,370
you associate each item in a series
where I'm

94
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,760
a context that provides an order
blocking as well so

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,270
arm that's placed team the the main
issue here is that

96
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,580
memory span forwards is a little better
than we spend non work so

97
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,830
even when the serial recall I techniques
here

98
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,849
is not a thing easy to remember truly
random

99
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,280
past and just teen demonstrate

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
how non words about it

101
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,679
i sorry a worse and worse thing left is

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,659
I showed you before they just in a
different order now and now it's a word

103
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,750
I'm sorry balloting call

104
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,520
easley you'll was it now

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,169
now and most people earn

106
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:03,849
okay and I'm I case and perhaps if he
doesn't have to remember one random

107
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:04,570
sequence

108
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,289
a letters that would really be a problem
and but in reality you just have to

109
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:09,729
remember

110
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,270
attends a pass-first and her staff make
each one unique as well so

111
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,940
that's not much good move on please

112
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,110
weekday okay

113
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,190
say these are questions are not met
because people are much better

114
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,300
remembering the meaning of password than
they are

115
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,360
at remembering the superficial details
that make up the password

116
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,610
and so unfortunately he's a issue 3 Nana

117
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,770
to you and type in the password almost
correctly songs

118
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,310
has the same meaning or has a similar
styling

119
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,770
missus Mike al fayed to say just a car

120
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,560
by and that's not my password also
clarify

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,830
I K there instead at passing

122
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,060
passwords must be entered verbatim am
which requires knowledge of the accounts

123
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,969
%uh which account which structure which
passed with me and

124
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:02,830
as well as it not be easy T type in
password accurately when you don't have

125
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,839
the visual feedback to sample stars are

126
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,080
we don't I am details

127
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,219
I'm like the meaning tend to fade
quickly and more susceptible to

128
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,370
interference

129
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,289
and said to demonstrate this point I
asked me to try and remember as many

130
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,320
details in those pictures: possible on
again I'm going to be very second

131
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,320
we're

132
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,110
year

133
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:39,110
I'm so sorry I'm not that's ok min

134
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,620
Utd right just try and take in as much
as the pictures possibly even got five

135
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,920
seconds then

136
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
and that's that like a site

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,890
what was the picture all enjoy nature

138
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,439
what were they doing in

139
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,150
yeah up

140
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,339
okay right so you got

141
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,040
you got the just me fine nappa details
many how many rounds on Armada

142
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,980
how many rooms where the them

143
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,360
no cheating I make you guys put on

144
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,640
up okay cheerful and the baby in the
Catalans where you said Tara said

145
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,189
I get away answer i won an object
getting

146
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,980
house not only after Apple

147
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,500
yeah

148
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,560
unlikely that all you can remember all
the items

149
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,920
saying different things +91 80 that you
can remember I didn't think one for

150
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,760
side I by I how many square is made up
the panel members about not calling

151
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,050
well then Rep

152
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,680
there was a don't fix it rofl and

153
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,979
having a housewarming flown extra fee
thanks again

154
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,430
so and there was no te pone

155
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,180
right there were four nails be a lot
people with me

156
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,010
one I was hoping more top

157
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,180
okay so and can okay so this is what
their picture that like

158
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,790
its related to the final member shall
not talk about it you're free

159
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,589
a memory test and and

160
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,880
at that in difference between right

161
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,240
Michael before that I am actually gonna
ask you to close anything you have

162
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
internet access with

163
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,900
so don't want to see them next time what
I mean it might do it

164
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,530
or outside

165
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,390
I see this this computer and my computer
and nine

166
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,630
balance the light that was very much
open yeah I am trying to hide it

167
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,070
a clay come here I'm not gonna take
turns reading

168
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,700
you can you can up

169
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,709
%uh I

170
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:18,020
yeah everybody hands up in the air right

171
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,270
okay right I'm got right

172
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,709
case I'm and unsurprisingly was easy to
recall that now was already demonstrated

173
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,589
that but most surprising by force and
was equally easy to recognize

174
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:33,280
recall surpass was a spiced tea and me

175
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,410
regulations which in a random sequence
of numbers letters in

176
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,650
and symbols how expected to recall them
recognition

177
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,230
better and I'm gonna demonstrate this by
asking me t tell me

178
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm more order the Google colors appear
and I'm

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,860
helping because I've got for college
there snapple

180
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,860
this 9

181
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,380
come maybe go on shall

182
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:12,380
okay fine and K which includes is
correct rights expectations but

183
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,459
rickles my point and I case and now

184
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,709
I we r onto you security related issues

185
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:23,800
the security respect am the security of
the people willing to take a largely

186
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,020
dependent on this lonely people to
respect them

187
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,310
and we have about as human species the
fact is that the session technological

188
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,900
advances

189
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,390
outpace are soluble tourist expert
receiving risks

190
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,670
in our environment so I am

191
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,810
what samples like it I K side

192
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,380
attacks from a predator like this guy
here or a shark

193
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,520
in modern-day and more vivid and more
gruesome than the more abstract attack

194
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,100
over here which is a cyberattack

195
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,450
side people says more saline and their
minds

196
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,520
which means people I'm overestimate

197
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,160
how probable this one and and that one

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,920
I am so yeah

199
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,360
because people are affected by Sen
occurrences from 9/11 to shark attacks

200
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,140
thank Americans months I society seem
improbable

201
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,410
and this particular here stick out just
describing this could be a availability

202
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,480
your state not some several examples of
the

203
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,690
availability heuristic and probably

204
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,319
the most notable is that people seem to
be more afraid of flying

205
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,459
many are all driving a car

206
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,709
even though you're more likely to crash
a car you are Tammy

207
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,510
plane crash and the reason for that is
that planes at plane crashes tend to be

208
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,360
reported on

209
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,940
in the media they also have quite the
same outcomes am

210
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,569
and it's the same for and people are
more scared are

211
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:50,949
like random act Tara than they are
intimate violence

212
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:55,180
hiney intimate violence and how much fun
happen and you've got others like

213
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,620
people were scared bird plane far more
than they were scared

214
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,880
are no leaving bird I case that
availability heuristic you

215
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
people are also subject I to

216
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,410
a control bias I am where

217
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,550
think that things are not control
there's less risk associated with it

218
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,599
and so I'm and

219
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,069
for example getting on a plane you not
control find that plane

220
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:27,650
getting the car iron upright car so

221
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm boom password security is very much
in the uses

222
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,209
see control making is more likely to
underestimate the risks associated

223
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,290
weak passwords and people often but

224
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,300
finally victims of often victims being
down in fact

225
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,370
I'm demonstrate this by asked me to
think about how you answer the following

226
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,280
question:

227
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,870
you not have to answer we can pretend
you got it right

228
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,280
I K side imagine a disease outbreak that
is expected to close at 10 people choose

229
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,740
between these two alternative treatment
programs programs

230
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,810
a temp saved program be there's a
one-third probability

231
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,069
600 people the same anti probability
that nineteen

232
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,160
say you guys go unanswered had

233
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,270
you can tell me if you want now

234
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,600
and I guess I'll am

235
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,110
and be happy thing utility p.m.
differences and sure thing these address

236
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,120
at home runway

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,329
and more people tend his programming and
programming

238
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:30,290
you think about these two options now
than 400 people die

239
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,719
and there's a 1:30 probability no 95%
probability

240
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,720
600 people would I which from the 90's

241
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:50,910
I'll REM

242
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,949
like I did all the work I K well

243
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,258
okay that I

244
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,579
I K so and then defense he needs two
options here and I am be

245
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,800
I was the A&B were and presented in
terms of gain so how many lives saved

246
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,040
and seen the present in terms family
lives lost and so despite this thing

247
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
it's the other way around more people
which is programmed in them MC

248
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,319
and what this means is that people tend
to be more risk-averse it when it comes

249
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,128
to games

250
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,339
and and more willing team risk

251
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,639
losses the Miata rest games anyway so

252
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,439
I am in terms password security this
implies the people gonna be happy to

253
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,089
rest some level security

254
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,839
an Associated decibel reportable
passwords

255
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,240
and I'm happy to risk receive disability
games satiated poor pass by

256
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,129
practice mothers indirectly such Thomas
this is like nothing

257
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:50,720
aside from being poor evaluation
probably miss people poor

258
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,029
at evaluating very humorous I am

259
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,230
and so as well as overestimating the
probability most spectacular vans people

260
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,529
underestimate probability bad things
happening to them at all

261
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:08,529
so and things like smoking

262
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,679
I'm are eating badly have less immediate
consequences which also makes it

263
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,409
less solid in your mind say for example
varity a cupcake and immediately went

264
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:23,350
here I would stop eating cupcakes that
because I can convince myself its not

265
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,010
that bad

266
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,010
i cant im

267
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,110
and hi these million common risks

268
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,229
that don't have any consequences and is
important because people are getting

269
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,840
the severity risk from making securities
administrators from

270
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,250
and what's worse is that knowledge
doesn't change paid him

271
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,390
and and so we like to believe that more
information we get uses the best to

272
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,780
behave that's just not true

273
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,850
and governments continue to try and
leave that to you

274
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,809
constant campaigns about stops making
her you want something badly hurt you 5

275
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,399
with the seat belt that doesn't are you
in doesn't work

276
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:05,000
basically I am so and and this is
because people I hope

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,169
optimism bias I am

278
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,860
which is when people believe that
they'll do better than other people who

279
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,580
are getting the exact same activity

280
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,090
and that's the sole reason why people
don't always think my cancer happens to

281
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,789
other people

282
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:22,520
diabetes happens people car crashes
happen to other people because at this

283
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,530
optimism bias

284
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,460
and this year stick is one possible
reason for ignoring security risks even

285
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,750
after you heard about security risk
elsewhere

286
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,830
I am and the typical view passwords it's
possible to buy confirmation bias

287
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,110
which is when seek admission that
matches your beliefs and

288
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,729
no information that doesn't much a
police I'm which means that people at

289
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,100
the same I've never been hacked

290
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,168
and use that evidence for their behavior

291
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,080
until they do you get hacked and then
all of a sudden now takes a process but

292
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,299
coming onto something major more secure
I am

293
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,399
so are the shows across it here that was
done in the sixties but it's really

294
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:00,979
simple

295
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,159
and what did you think and participants
and

296
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,539
back I and possibly this month the deck
of cards have thanks and happy faces in

297
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:09,789
seventy percent browning

298
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,629
and vice versa the other half and
participants were more accurate

299
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,700
so they have to guess what cards what's
coming next police let

300
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,899
and participants were more accurate when
with them

301
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,739
said happy arts than 70 percent founding
bassist

302
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,059
and what this shows is that uses
preference

303
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,918
on people's preference for pasta things
make them less accurate about negative

304
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:33,330
things

305
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,629
so I'm people time value security
guidelines

306
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,140
and become follow them anyway I will
turn it

307
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,000
the author whatever the alternative has
been one uses girls

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,679
and him to lose it's probably less
concerned about them cation

309
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,460
i'm concerned. just sign in thanks
Patrick so

310
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,919
I'm or any other account service that
helps I preparation for the Pico team

311
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,340
in at pecan

312
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,470
obviously and but there are other one
saying

313
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,960
a possible types password Africa
password cessation

314
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,669
past its prime Margaret and

315
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,990
what people miss peak in his mouth and
pension scheme that was originally

316
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,549
presented by Stan 2011 as a small
dedicated device

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,899
membership credentials for you say
you've got from

318
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:27,899
25 password the one device and

319
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:31,110
it doesn't have to me can take on any
phone that can be taken from from a key

320
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,439
for

321
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,580
to it to watch it doesn't have to comes
from that what it doesn't have

322
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,980
cameras to commission a QR code a
display

323
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,299
choosing between accounts and a main
bathroom selecting an account an

324
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,080
apparent

325
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,129
preparing an account with your pic main
usability

326
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,480
benefits are and lessen the impact on
memory less

327
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,320
actual physical effort and it's going to
movies say

328
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,059
okay so I'm uses also don't have to
worry about

329
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,220
back and that's because they carry with
them and devices

330
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,429
scoopy disciplines that great like an or
a loveliness

331
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,669
around resell that tells whether or not
you're near

332
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,790
I mean looks when you're near that mean
I should also be an orange

333
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,860
I failed a I'll

334
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,479
I am yeh said Peterson share kept

335
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,110
this is Howard in my knowledge it's like
is the creepiest

336
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,610
that that the disciplines and

337
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,449
share a cryptographic key and when is a
sufficient number of them near the peak

338
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,130
at the peak

339
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,250
not I am

340
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,389
so there also Security benefits can
continue south and cation and resistance

341
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:37,500
to guessing

342
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,409
long am

343
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:44,740
foreign by any questions yes I know its
ambitious that's precisely what I'm

344
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,760
doing

345
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,889
night read quite

346
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:53,789
I K questions

347
00:21:53,789 --> 00:22:00,789
I'm a little bit early apologize

348
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:08,169
yeah I just I just like

349
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,810
yes sup your

350
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,159
the up

351
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,510
now no her

352
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,390
I night but and optimism bias

353
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,610
and is something that we've evolved to
this if you start just see

354
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:39,459
the world were actually lies you
wouldn't bother I'm fast-track a

355
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,540
like obviously that's not the academic
mister

356
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,300
that's what they mean when I say that I
couldn't find it

357
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,470
that's right and

358
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,790
so yeah and make sense for you to
believe things are gonna turn out well

359
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,220
you wouldn't keep unit a sim

360
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,250
yeah politician he's also

361
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:12,250
said min

362
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,390
up all yeah understanding

363
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,130
a psychological reason for yep

364
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,010
I mop

365
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,830
I'm inward I also years

366
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,980
didn't II

367
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,760
dole's mothers its all

368
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,890
companies people while rid

369
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,600
all spiritual wall

370
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,860
me the also

371
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,409
us you should well he

372
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,800
up so we expect to

373
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,590
much those security

374
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,800
media so we don't see any point

375
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,090
instructed me

376
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,320
wall course yes sOooo

377
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,270
thing is my thats I'm

378
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,740
his us

379
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,730
Malthouse was allows

380
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,020
use wall for mmm

381
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:39,389
this means because people

382
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,420
passing responsibility this not
responsible for any security breaches

383
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,720
something else 10 mission should tell
you

384
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,520
logic that anything

385
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,570
and just I wasn't old thing

386
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,918
good question

387
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,909
wasn't much in then

388
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:10,909
questions

389
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,659
mmm

390
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,050
if you if you if you played on the right
heuristic

391
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:29,050
I think

392
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,270
I'm had one just left my head

393
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:39,270
I some say some mmm

394
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,820
in

395
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,200
yeah the problem is is that the
government's focusing on much but when

396
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,430
he comes to behavior

397
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,820
changer me couldn t the theory of
planned

398
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,500
and behavior there with briefings

399
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,700
actor tension to change your behavior
first

400
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,530
is subjective norms what everybody else
is doing routine

401
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,690
the second is your attitude towards its
weapons

402
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,320
receive the payment to be positive when
acted and the third is

403
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,980
with 3 seems quite important perceived
behavioral control

404
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,300
so how much control GPC you somehow it's
time for example I want to get

405
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,350
yes positive outcome I you

406
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,389
positively I thank the I think
positively

407
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:31,080
you not me me for my friend doing Marie
you encourage me to do at this scene

408
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,360
and Michael but the James really
expensive done

409
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,870
would be judged in then that would
meeting to consider all these three

410
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,600
things and

411
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,830
surprisingly knowledge isn't really in

412
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,210
in model its

413
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,700
activity the fact that no feeding
knowledge

414
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,580
people to switch off think it's rubbish
another time I think people don't trust

415
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,520
the government

416
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,040
mind why my ticket misinformation

417
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,200
yeah you wanted to change behavior

418
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,600
company on the actual St paving

419
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,020
models this is all set aside diesel who

420
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:19,020
everything evolution up

421
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,920
we yeah go

422
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,530
this you way raise

423
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,070
special could scare them and make them
think they have been hacked

424
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,200
that would not be ethical

425
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,810
I'm and okay so if we get back to you
didn't write back

426
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,629
yet that would work for me him

427
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,980
well yeah

428
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,160
a different one for nineteen should
behave you wanted people to change that

429
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,590
to be

430
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,470
which has unlikely you really change
from secure prosper to and secure

431
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,050
password I'm secure password

432
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,669
and the nominating income for some some
mental process to justify

433
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,780
say depends if you can get something has
always use a terrible prospering

434
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,020
instance he's a good one someone to go
back to using a bad morning

435
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,820
post

436
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,200
he

437
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,300
that that yeah up

438
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,129
i'm talking about. significant City
change

439
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,990
said

440
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,790
hmm

441
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,760
go back to you i'm talking

442
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,990
i'm talking about. for example ice to be

443
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,510
Christian and I went for a major

444
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,260
teaching not just because teenager I
like an

445
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,410
I went I went for a major change in
decided I wasn't

446
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,440
not be extremely difficult to back into
being

447
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,870
believe just because I really was one
who are you went through the

448
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,739
cognitive processes to make that change
so

449
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,610
something major like that some become
just I just thing between st. major

450
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,270
things back

451
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,360
for something like eating badly

452
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,699
its easy to dislike the sling that were
inside me

453
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,040
Lincoln you Tempe on

454
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,129
and serious would

455
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,390
all not designed is just like I'm why we
shouldn't have a belly rub

456
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,890
I wish I was better I could do that

457
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,660
different you

458
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,830
them good

459
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:51,830
yes

460
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,380
I'm I suppose you could get them to you
and

461
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,250
used technically have my cam sentence
and then you get into

462
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,270
just United the beginning work said land

463
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,770
and if he can stop that the whole point
is I think passage the crap

464
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,440
so that's why up

465
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,899
hip

466
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:23,090
got BK highlighting

467
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,379
month even on my I used terrible tactics
the process 99

468
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:34,379
I still do it

469
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:40,940
all more group

470
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,870
mmm no I didn't come up with that

471
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,529
I got back from the sky yeah means

472
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:51,769
the guy I quoted here from

473
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:58,769
this

474
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,199
night is created said

475
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,190
yaa should

476
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,009
I said I didn't have applied passports
because nine direct research has been

477
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:12,889
done on passports so I'm if you wanted

478
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:17,039
TC people are more likely to take risks
with passwords

479
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,889
presented in terms of loss for versus
