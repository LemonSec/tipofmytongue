introduce yourself

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,619
all right thank you hi everyone so

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,490
printer is nicer I work with

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,490
security engineer in Switzerland so I do
interesting for a living

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,558
I also do a lot of city s everyone in
the world

7
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,860
I do speak at different conferences like
deft on Ash days

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,790
exit row about various subjects like
your web security

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,210
hardware

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,240
vending machines Exeter and

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,520
also hacker addendum mad scientists

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,300
way since I'd like to break stuff most
of the time

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,550
great stuff and I gonna prepare them but
I

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,910
and it to open to crack open some things
to run how it works

15
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,319
0 it functions and hopefully

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,770
to find nice things to to actually

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,890
show people holding work with such a

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,930
ISO love beer Anna

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,979
grew them myself so may be few

20
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,009
wanna chat with us world this evening

21
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,380
can just buy ambien with jet a lot more

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,380
yeah so for me my name is my way

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm Walker in the same company into too
long I'm doing contest

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,910
I'm who a member of the team as you
release over for the

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,630
Shia I'm the developer of by a false

26
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,880
is the Firefox extension for performing
a

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,568
brute force attack on the formula and I
love black metal from

28
00:01:53,569 --> 00:02:00,569
so no race will be a good place for me
Seoul foreign tourists

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,899
we the hood little about possible we all
know but what sucks

30
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,560
is not cool is not so easy but issues
every rep

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
so managing possible is really all you
need to

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,420
the different possible for every seat
you left where

33
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,109
unit with strong possible and with them
to you

34
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,250
reuse Buswell than the

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,800
don't have possible to came other

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,720
of course they all a lot of

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
bus will monitor its good thing is sick
you

38
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,410
you only need the one possible for go
toward a more

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,549
%uh a lot of them exist in the

40
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:45,629
from for what in different platform but

41
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,470
possible madre on both socks because if
so on gets your route possible

42
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,060
the you can access or you're not up the

43
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,510
there are a lot of tools for cracking
possible the

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,510
keep us drawn possible to have Crocker

45
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,548
to all the you or the use you

46
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,910
wanna join trial will do you

47
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,310
backup your database and o'leary through
about

48
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,310
your daughter is the and Krypton secure
so for the backup

49
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,280
do do you really want to

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,730
both your the highways in the

51
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,480
in the Internet with the Dropbox

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,399
Google Drive Omega the are you sure it's
a

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,590
really a good at. we see in the bus that
the solution

54
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,109
as we've compromised so

55
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,239
it's possible to Alexis to feel better
and

56
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,950
of course no

57
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,069
there is priest so the government has
accessed directly to

58
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,659
older data and directly to all your
possible

59
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,290
so what we can do

60
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,480
we think that bus walls are like the

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,780
keys but for all the our online access

62
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,669
so white-owned why don't we

63
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,009
stole them or use them like your real
keys you always

64
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:24,180
a few keys on your book at a maybe you
have a backup of your keys but

65
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,370
you don't care because you never lost
your keys and you never know

66
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,409
give your keys to anyone so

67
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:36,000
we create

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,430
project in the bus were its

69
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,479
like hearing but the it for you but weld

70
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,130
you always have your device with you and
you use them

71
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:54,130
the when you want to

72
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,849
so why which was the name a bus for
because the women age

73
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,289
boss Paul with all were so is the
combination of those who name

74
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,669
the with a strong vision accident it
means heave

75
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,859
is the bus while and a

76
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,960
so that the name possible a

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,760
is already used so we need to change the
ice with the 15

78
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,409
the

79
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,680
institutions so

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,380
what are the features of us were is easy
to use and

81
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,310
we have a for torture buttons to
navigate

82
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,540
a one LCD screen one that

83
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,580
8 each's a

84
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,840
and with a rubber client application for

85
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,880
create or your boss waldman got some
stuff

86
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,389
it safe to use

87
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,830
everything is the greeted with the

88
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,210
a yes key the bus whether that are
stored in the

89
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,570
is deeply although in the key stolen the

90
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,950
when on the device unease not possible
to retreat

91
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,460
we hope so and you need a pin code to

92
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,570
another device before use it and the

93
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,610
if when you want to unlock the device

94
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,539
if you make folders three-time the

95
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,159
cheese results so is not possible to for
you

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,850
I

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,260
you can use but will for the use a bus
12

98
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,669
and Alonso for or TV so

99
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,650
a at this time is only compatible with
QTP

100
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,039
implementation is too

101
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,750
one use for the Google with them and

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,190
and it get John type your possible for
you because the

103
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,320
teensy so you can just plug in and these
viewers the

104
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,820
a cue ball when it automatically like a
possible for you

105
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,480
and it works on the nearly every kind of
device

106
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,790
we make some tests on the on droid phone

107
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:14,790
he talks you know she's free to use

108
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,430
after other comp rooms we the post

109
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,050
all the could the could source and

110
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,620
even the plan for the cases so you can
Prince you on

111
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,000
and it's really easy to make one

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,130
you just need some soloing I Roman a
friend with the

113
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:40,130
3d printer

114
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,240
think so to

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,460
builds a bus where like you with it

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,279
known in its a teensy 3.0 but you can
buy for

117
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,430
19 bucks also need to have the

118
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,689
tft-lcd screen with a SD card reader

119
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:09,379
that you can find for twelve dollars an
SD card on Amazon

120
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,729
I found them on at seven dollars may be
confined cheaper one sunny

121
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,779
let's tell you about things like these
access to a 3d printer

122
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:22,240
it depends on if you have I think you
have a hackerspace in a Bergen

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,819
rights should

124
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,520
yeah you should alright so maybe they
have a trip into

125
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,529
or if you have a lot as a hackerspace
near you maybe they have a trip into

126
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:39,448
and they can do it for you houston y on
soldier

127
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:43,578
to go for it you can burn yourself I did
several times by

128
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:48,010
making this one for her the

129
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,220
main components of Basware is tinted 3.0

130
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,069
and say and it's an encore it as

131
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:58,339
many in and outputs in 10 years

132
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,639
the you arts sorry Alliance

133
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,260
can use SBI Reliance it has a

134
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,750
the capacitive inputs so you can detect

135
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,470
if you use over your finger to actually
activates

136
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,500
and inputs that's a great thing you can
use its with the Arduino ID

137
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,250
everyone knows a the other you know ants

138
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,230
10 the cool thing is that it has an
internal RTC

139
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,089
so you just need to as a a simple
crystal

140
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,389
on the boards with her hands with a
battery

141
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,610
begins save the the date and time which
is

142
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,500
quite useful for the due to be and yet
its

143
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,120
just awesome you can do many many things
with this

144
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,399
this is really great so

145
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,560
as we have told you everything is within

146
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,640
using the Arduino ID so you can just get
the codes

147
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,449
rate its side try to make as many
comments as possible so

148
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:05,599
it's quite easy for you to actually know
exactly what happens

149
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,459
and customize its on units you can
change let's say the

150
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,699
the screen callers you can change the
the pin codes

151
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:18,300
you can change the the number of lines
the the size of the

152
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,800
love the lines that are written on the
screen Exeter Exeter its really easy to

153
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,620
do it so

154
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,800
yeah just try it's an

155
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,849
have fun with that all the things

156
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,579
that you need to change are on the
beginning of the source code so

157
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,479
nominee you have to change the the AES
key you have to change

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,720
the the master password

159
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,630
but you can use to unlock the device
gonna so change

160
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,319
if you like to add more buttons you can
at them into code

161
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,389
those there are some

162
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,920
Constance to virtually no

163
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,519
what you can do with the buttons so you
can as one of them

164
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:07,399
two of them all anything like this
nominated it's pretty easy

165
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,970
regarding the SD card we use a simple
fact system

166
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,360
so every accounts you creates

167
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,240
and storing bus where is stored in a
single file a simple fine

168
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,829
so it's easy to create the backups you
just but here

169
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,899
that there's you got a new PC computer
files get them somewhere

170
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,339
and that's it ants

171
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,559
the only problem is that's the findings
are limited

172
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,009
so you can only creates Faiza a eights

173
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,730
characters long that's that maybe your
limitations so

174
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,410
issue never gets using the bus where you
cannot sets

175
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,180
the account names there are longer than
8 for the moment

176
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,430
that may be a problem just to show you
this is the file formats

177
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,579
so we have had a with forty-two

178
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,839
just a random value quite random

179
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,809
a then again

180
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,149
chose the Fighting type the one is for

181
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,379
a username/password fine jewish for no
TP fine

182
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:19,519
you can thats as

183
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
havin project US like 32 and creeds

184
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,949
a a fine a complete five so we can just
a profile that would be stored

185
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:31,559
securely I hope in the device

186
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,689
and then after that so you don't have

187
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:38,699
many sections which contains an ID for

188
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:43,349
the moment we only have username
passwords and then

189
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,800
the land up today to and then the

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,209
as: blocks Don cryptid containing your
data

191
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:53,800
your username or your password
everything's included the username the

192
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,469
password the seeds Exeter

193
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,139
so nominee should be quite secure

194
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:05,389
the most important thing to

195
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:09,339
a actually protects is the AES key so

196
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,829
what do we do exactly in inside the DNC
is

197
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,479
we only loads the a is key to run

198
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,209
on the when the Basware is unlocked this
is important so you can adjust

199
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,160
blog it's and the the key will be loaded
it's on the load its when you

200
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,510
actually unlocked the

201
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,939
the device so no money from a an
external point of view

202
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,150
you cannot actually connect to the DNC
and

203
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,520
get the key with the spirits are wxs

204
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,360
normally to be working the AES key

205
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,590
is normally stored in the a prom again

206
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,840
we then to use the internal fuse is

207
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,340
above the the chip to protect the a prom
for

208
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,880
from been Reds from with an external
tool

209
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,030
or issue just remove the chip and plug
it in the

210
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,550
in any primary though you cannot
actually get it normally

211
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,550
ants

212
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,740
yet to ASCII is clear from memory as
soon as the device is locked again so

213
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,970
just unplug its even sorry it will hurt
the other day asking from memory

214
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,150
when was the thingy a

215
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,579
I was thinking also abouts changing the
way

216
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,000
the AES key is stored in the device

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,180
I was may be thinking to store the

218
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,469
he is key one hopeful the AES key in the

219
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,910
actually in the program memory of the
chip and the other the other half

220
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,180
in the AM from so if you what's to

221
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,209
actually gets the whole as: key you have
to

222
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,160
find a way to get into the program code
and get the key

223
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,880
ants afterwards you have to actually
find another way to gets the

224
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,070
from access to the prom to get the other

225
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,440
part of the key so it will be much
difficult

226
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,620
if you fines or if you steal a bus were
from

227
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,210
from someone to actually gets the right
key i think thats

228
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,310
that would be magicians to

229
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,760
actually with that way regarding the
memory

230
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,900
the problem is that its sorry small chip
it does

231
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,550
not many Graham it as I think it's a

232
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,010
16k a friend so it's

233
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,319
not that easy to actually

234
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
a encrypt or decrypt large block update
us

235
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,810
and you have also to tool

236
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,219
to load all the as: tough into round two
actually

237
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,220
computer everything so this as

238
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,240
their lives there are many constraints

239
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,450
to arm

240
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,620
to be is a for it to be efficient

241
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,520
so well

242
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,449
we have tried to actually clean the
memory as soon as as it does not used

243
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,940
anymore well trying to clear everything

244
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,740
just remove the memory blocks the clear
them to a 20 issue with the

245
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,150
actually low the password we just clear
it's right after its really it has been

246
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,959
used so

247
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,800
nominee you want beer bill able to

248
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,020
retrieve some data what it's in use or

249
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,189
even if it has been

250
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:31,029
unplugged to be

251
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,620
more efficient yeah the bus where uses

252
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,009
a serial communication with your laptop
so

253
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,509
when you plug its you can just

254
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:47,410
keeper button pressed to actually get
into a special mode which is the command

255
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:47,829
modes

256
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:51,459
so as soon as this command mode is
activated you have to

257
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:56,209
they had to Red Robin and when you know
you have

258
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,399
made your PIN

259
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,910
mmm to transfer ok the the saline is
activated

260
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,819
ants we've created client application to
send commands to

261
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,740
the Basware to store new passwords to

262
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,709
Janet and accounts to modify an account
if you've changed your password

263
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,909
it can be it could be updated

264
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:23,610
on your on the bus where this is a good
thing one of the other thing is that

265
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,918
you can only push new data you cannot
retrieve it from the application of from

266
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,610
the serial mode so it's kind of the a
box

267
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,949
just but your secrets in the in that box
it will be included

268
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,090
and you cannot get it back directly only
which gets

269
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,220
data backed is to actually reads the

270
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,870
real on this read it on the screen or if
you want to type the password

271
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,000
press a button and with type 2 passwords
in the field US

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,320
US elected that link is also used to
synchronize the

273
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,350
the internal clock so if your TV is not
working anymore maybe you shoulda

274
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,459
synchronize the RTC made it worked great

275
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,470
what well ass the test with we've done

276
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,070
seem to be a syncing to be really good

277
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,080
but they may be a the

278
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,340
maybe some problems with the the RTC on
the long-term use

279
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,820
regarding the

280
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,379
communication protocol its quite simple
it's quite the same also as the

281
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,420
as the final system again just

282
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,940
the bush new comments to say that's okay

283
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,940
creates this new fine on the on the SD
card

284
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,240
and store in the section of the user
name that value

285
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,340
you just said it's clear text the bus
where we'll and credits

286
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,490
store within the SD card clean its
memory and your password is

287
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,220
protected in the device as we said

288
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,410
there are two modes the command mode
which is simple

289
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,590
so your line and in the normal modes the

290
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,590
devices on the scene as a as a USB
keyboard

291
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,909
so you can just use its June

292
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,060
actually thank you pass was for you that
thats with option

293
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,940
the application is

294
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,190
developed in Python with qt4 interface

295
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,830
its quite a simple interface just have

296
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,179
on the rafts the

297
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,820
the tree above the files the files and
folders that you have stored

298
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,830
you can create a new folder Lincoln
other you and you'd

299
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,199
at a new accounts and create a note to
be

300
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,890
by just putting the the name of the
accounts and the seed

301
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,970
that is used and image or the rest for
you

302
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,890
the communication starts

303
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,770
with the bus were sending for do for a
job again random values

304
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,000
then the

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,200
the client application defense its
comment

306
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,620
the best with what it was but will reply
with a zero

307
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,949
if something went wonky or with the one

308
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,100
if everything went okay that the men's
to

309
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,290
actually lists the root directory so

310
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:15,710
the comment is I'll mmm and see it okay
so the command is

311
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,280
for for listing 01 is the length

312
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,510
on the Palmetto and slashes just read
the

313
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,310
the roots above the decals the same for
the year the username

314
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,800
01 is the comment 11

315
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,820
in the total and of the back its 5

316
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,480
is the the length up the fight which is
slashed total

317
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,650
01 is for the fight type

318
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,700
its 01 it's a username/password 10 a
fight

319
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,980
no one is we want to have dates the

320
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,880
field number one the username eights

321
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,330
is for the length and password is the
new value that

322
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,049
needs to be stored in the in the

323
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,250
in the bus were so

324
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,730
swayze again everything is documented so
if you like to

325
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,419
creates or add a new comment all the

326
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:13,419
processing stuff is created just add a
new comment

327
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:17,240
a new function India in the codes and
you're ready to go

328
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,890
again if you were to create the new arm

329
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,549
client application everything I about
the protocol is documented

330
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,750
so can create the new application if
like to

331
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,330
in dotnet are nothing else so

332
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,639
it's time for a demo now militaria

333
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,640
like you

334
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,240
up

335
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,060
that

336
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,340
button so I'm connect my VPN and I want
to connect my

337
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,939
the raspberry p in my home to

338
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,890
the devices

339
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:35,890
here ledges cluggy

340
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,179
I need to unlock the device I'm sure

341
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,379
up the actual video of the where they do
in the

342
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:52,379
in the device

343
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:03,589
I select my raspberry

344
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,400
normally I just hit the the hunter
button

345
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,400
and they come again

346
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:40,549
can show you you

347
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,419
it with nothing on the device

348
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,030
her so I select my

349
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:56,399
the prior art the folder the

350
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,400
value for on the raspberry with my user
on my possible

351
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,869
interested the handover the ENTER button

352
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:19,869
everything works

353
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,299
so the roadmap now we

354
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,408
in the it's a better version began

355
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,460
seats ion only the basic function

356
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,070
the walking we will ease because the

357
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:01,570
after the conference no money we have a
festival

358
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,658
version for January for the moment we
use the

359
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,940
a new the

360
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,320
I V and you hook

361
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,090
it's you I D you and we want to %uh the

362
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,780
and I G which is told in the

363
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,410
in to stop if each file on

364
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,490
use the the other fused to protect the

365
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,640
the problem is that in place for the
moment

366
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,230
and we want to fix for the problem with
the communication on with the fight for

367
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:40,400
one the

368
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,770
futures improvement the we want to

369
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,940
creates a the bus for generator so we
can use the

370
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,600
touch button for users but you hun

371
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,490
in the touch but unfortunately it's
possible I'm

372
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,700
be compatible with the

373
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,100
although UT people to go like it would
you be

374
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,639
the

375
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm we want to use the

376
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,100
USB as a fight storage but for the
moment in c320 is not the

377
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,120
able to to read the use me

378
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,790
way to the

379
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:31,920
as a USB key for the moment so a on the
positions that in C 1.0 and 2.0

380
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,010
there is the possibility to actually
acts as a

381
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,129
drive so we might be able to emulates

382
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,490
the five so maybe you can store you such
SSH

383
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,710
private keys on it to be stored likes

384
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,780
every other password and if you 12

385
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,899
actually get them back the just percent

386
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,620
and we with the mounted as a USB Drive
and just

387
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,010
unified so you can use it to actually
log in as a

388
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:08,010
with you as a teacher by the key and I

389
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,290
why we are here

390
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,320
a because we need to

391
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,689
only to the the project and

392
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,850
maybe we make some

393
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,969
mistake the maybe the awesome but

394
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,790
and the we really suck at people

395
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,980
so we think we doing

396
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,170
the things would but he's not the key

397
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,810
and the we have basic knowledge of the

398
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,250
how we're talking but maybe possible to
to get the key from the

399
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:52,250
the problem in the way we didn't see to

400
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,260
sorry we need you to come

401
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,600
the talk with us some don't know the
project to make you own

402
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,439
we bought the book you and we we can
improve a

403
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,989
all the products all

404
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:16,409
used up

405
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:22,179
yep you can do it

406
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:25,830
for the moment you cannot actually can
be a st.

407
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,939
it's on the stored on the device and
there's no way

408
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,470
for the moment you actually get it back
so

409
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,869
with don't know if it's a good thing or
not

410
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:38,869
to actually be able to it

411
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:42,928
for the keyonna so defense

412
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:47,899
defense we we were not sure that it will
be safe

413
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:51,508
to be able to let you read the key no
way or

414
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:54,759
in another so for the moment it's only
on the device and

415
00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:01,759
there's no way to actually get it would

416
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:24,890
well okay

417
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:39,790
the

418
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,629
again you can set the key as one

419
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:49,170
you need to actually with the when you
when you start the prior the

420
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,640
that's where you have to set the key
from both so you have to

421
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,680
use a Kielder that

422
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,690
just sets the key-value that would be
stored in the air from

423
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,920
at the moment and the afterwards you can
actually

424
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,990
flash the

425
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,430
the best with the the right where that
we use that

426
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,180
so there is

427
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,520
moments in the life of the on that the

428
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,970
the password that you have

429
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,530
you actually have to write the by
yourself so maybe you can just

430
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,879
to be its sheet of paper under your
keyboard for

431
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,950
to the right in so

432
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,350
yeah you there was a moment where you

433
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:38,080
know the key and you have to set but
afterwards the best ways

434
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,080
to not be able to actually which is that

435
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,200
laws okay

436
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,520
up

437
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,210

used just

462
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:00,830
said

463
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:12,399
difference

464
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,399
all which

465
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,580
does

466
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,710
his people's

467
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,960
us fuels

468
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,960
no

469
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,030
its it's just heaviest thing

470
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,270
just for people that that they knew that

471
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,980
we we think that

472
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,140
keep by keeping the on thats the
difference

473
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,629
solution or

474
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,090
actually stolen you

475
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,060
on laptop also good so

476
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,310
yes the nothing problems

477
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:31,710
this is

478
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,950
our proposal for a solution for that we
know

479
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,020
it's not the

480
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,579
purple soul the

481
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,000
just two something that is which

482
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,700
to create but you can do for on your own

483
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,660
you know the PIN or you can here

484
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:01,660
would just up

485
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,460
want so know this is just a homie

486
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,220
and without going to provide way to

487
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,660
actually have you both those

488
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,930
way good to use it is not the best way
to

489
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,580
to do it with the improvements to so
that's what's up

490
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,130
business improving the way so

491
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:32,130
all much well

492
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,950
I been several

493
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,960
evenings on it yeah I

494
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,990
deeply in love with the DNC's so

495
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,060
for the moment they didn't find any way
when use the fuse

496
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,540
the with fuses to actually get for

497
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,180
the ASP and for the moment

498
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,279
wage I know for if the arches

499
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,500
waste the fuse is always that the fuses

500
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,570
without losing data but and

501
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,660
not sure it's possible didn't see
anything on

502
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,920
that kind of chips so for the moment

503
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,080
I think it'll said

504
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:24,080
I

505
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:05,150
be okay so

506
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,360
the question is a you how

507
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,790
you locker don't

508
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,950
so internally

509
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:21,390
the when you gift to the locking system

510
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,230
everything in the memories yes them and
then you'll

511
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:31,220
benefit infinite loop that wait for

512
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,319
for you to enter your go and

513
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,940
if the vehicle is correct from the Lou

514
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,940
getting the menu all moment installed in
the

515
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,308
in the school to actually getting into
the go to change

516
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:59,309
the bigger and that's why we used for
them

517
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:12,930
if said

518
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:47,910
everything is from the US

519
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:49,799
all

520
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:00,420
yeah

521
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,580
said

522
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:12,580
up

523
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,040

524
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:27,040

so

527
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,579
thing is that

528
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,920
US on the act the USB keyboard

529
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,200
so you can just which actually sent

530
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,558
unless get into but you have to suburban

531
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,950
power of power on the device wait for

532
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,399
two seconds with the button press and
afterwards

533
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,619
to your PIN code and then you are in the
common so you cannot

534
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:14,670
accidentally get into command modes on
