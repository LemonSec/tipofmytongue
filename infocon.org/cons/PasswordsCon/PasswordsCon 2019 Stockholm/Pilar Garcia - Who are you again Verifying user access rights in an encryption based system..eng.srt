1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:10,139
um this summer I went to blackhat and

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,009
while I was browsing the talks I saw one

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,400
that was called GDP are using privacy

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,400
laws to steal identities I was like yeah

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,849
I want to see that one either

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,979
I learned that we're doing everything

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,890
right and we all get to congratulate

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,080
each other or be happy or I have to run

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,530
and fix things right now by the way I

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,750
called ahead a win-win situation so I'm

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,090
gonna talk today about verifying user

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,120
access rights in an encryption based

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:47,489
system and Garcia from 1password so

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,269
these are a couple of 1password little

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,919
friends and let me tell you a little bit

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,320
about what it is one password is a

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,219
password manager as all of you have

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,469
learned earlier this morning it

19
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,140
generates stores and outer fills

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,530
passwords for you all your data is

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,880
encrypted one password data is encrypted

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:16,170
locally by a secret key that is a high

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,350
entropy 128 bits that is generated

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,450
locally and never sent over to us and a

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,210
master password that you choose when you

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,170
create your account that is also never

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,240
sent over to us if you're using one

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,130
password with other people the other

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,070
people in your account can help you

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,890
recover access the people you've given

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,339
trust to but all set one password can

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,170
never recover access to your account if

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,619
you lose your secret key or your master

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,950
password you're on your own that's it we

35
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,110
can't do anything okay so that's it

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,479
right if you have the decryptions case

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,399
then you have access to the data if you

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,380
don't you don't we can all go home well

39
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,070
that's not the end of the story because

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,780
in a system used by humans

41
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,660
we'll end up interacting with those

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,360
humans so I'm going to tell you about

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,720
four scenarios in which in our

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,840
day-to-day interaction

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,770
with our customers we have to further

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,110
verify their identities for the first of

47
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,940
these two scenarios the customer was

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,180
talking to you and I'm sorry my throat

49
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,710
is a little bit course after the flights

50
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,650
for the first two scenarios

51
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,420
the customer or the person we're talking

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,100
to does not have access to one password

53
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,709
and for the second two they do so let me

54
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,690
begin with the first one it's related to

55
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:48,190
two factor authentication one password

56
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,790
allows you to set two-factor

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,459
authentication via totp it will only

58
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,709
require the second factor when the

59
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:04,510
concept of two-factor authentication is

60
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:07,360
relevant so I'm set up a new device of

61
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,090
course with having two-factor

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,660
authentication we have yet one more

63
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,560
thing that people can lose to get

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,350
themselves about so what do we do you

65
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,290
can tell people please pretty please

66
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,650
store your recovery key somewhere so you

67
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,429
can get yourself out of it you can tell

68
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,420
people please set up several

69
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,459
Authenticator apps in more than one

70
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,958
phone so if you lose one you can still

71
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:41,110
access it you can allow the option to

72
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:46,480
disable to a PHA from anywhere where you

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:50,560
have set up one password you can even

74
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,829
give them SMS recovery coach no we are

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,900
not going to do that if anyone wants to

76
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,480
see the collection of scams that I've

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,340
gotten in the last year via SMS I have a

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:07,420
few fun ones it doesn't matter how hard

79
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,110
you try there will still be people who

80
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,589
get themselves looked out and then you

81
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,859
have to decide what you're going to do

82
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,680
it can be tempting to say hey we gave

83
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:23,919
you like ten things to do you didn't do

84
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,370
them you're on your own but we are not

85
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,500
going to do that

86
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,960
we already have to say that for the

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,300
secret key and master password and we

88
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,198
don't want to add yet one more thing to

89
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,860
get people to lose their data so the

90
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,020
first thing that we require is for the

91
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,930
request to disabled to a PHA to come

92
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,000
from the exact same email address that

93
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,419
the one password account is registered

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,430
to but control of the email address is

95
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:59,070
not enough so what we do is we ask

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,740
people a few questions about their bond

97
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,440
password account for an example what is

98
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,840
the date that you created the account

99
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,320
how are you paying for it what are the

100
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,969
names on their devices

101
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,219
enough questions that will give us a

102
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,100
confidence that the person we are

103
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,039
communicating with is indeed the owner

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,250
of the account once we get enough of

105
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,370
these questions as answered correctly

106
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,760
then we can go ahead and disable 2fa for

107
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,100
them and just so we're clear if this

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,580
person doesn't have already the

109
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,240
decryption keys this able to FA will not

110
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:43,169
really do anything so this is the first

111
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,289
scenario in which we need to verify who

112
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,210
we're talking to the second one in which

113
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,120
the person doesn't have access to the

114
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,210
account it is pretty interesting because

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:59,220
it has to do with one of the things that

116
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:01,070
is most important for all of us not when

117
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,300
one password went to the cloud

118
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:09,510
it'll people and we had a lot of people

119
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,419
or a few people who were upset about

120
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:15,320
their subscription thing and we heard

121
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,150
like no subscriptions are always kami

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,960
you only want people to put their credit

123
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,489
card there and forget no we are doing

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,099
this because this is the best experience

125
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,300
of one password for people but if you

126
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,960
don't want to give us your money

127
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,210
we don't want it plain and simple or we

128
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,810
thought it was simple then we got an

129
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:39,090
email like this one our company credit

130
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,020
card is being built for a one password

131
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,260
account

132
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:48,450
we don't know who owns this account but

133
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:52,289
we need to stop the church suddenly this

134
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:54,750
is not that easy we don't want to be

135
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,950
taking this person's money if they don't

136
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,960
even know where it's going to but we

137
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,920
also cannot go and tinker with someone's

138
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,289
account just like that so this is not

139
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,050
the only way in which we can have the

140
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,540
situation these are a couple of other

141
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,870
common scenarios at the end of the day

142
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,480
the point is the person does not have

143
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,460
access to the one password account the

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,470
person does not have access to the email

145
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,380
account they might not even know what it

146
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,900
is but they're seeing a one password

147
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,580
charge in their credit card view and

148
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:38,630
they want that to stop and it's we have

149
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:43,890
to help them do that so our very first

150
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:46,260
solution was okay we can find out who

151
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,890
the owner is let's get in touch with the

152
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,460
owner and ask them to fix it yeah we

153
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:58,880
never got any replies so that had surely

154
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,530
helped that much our second attempt was

155
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,550
this is not about the one password

156
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,440
account this is about the charge figure

157
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,610
it out with your bank please put in a

158
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,090
dispute and this was better at least so

159
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,550
the problem gets solved but it wasn't

160
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,880
still not very good um it was a lot of

161
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:24,000
work for the customer it send the wrong

162
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,580
message well we chose to do this because

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,200
it sounded like the most secure way and

164
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,220
the smartest way to keep people's

165
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,799
privacy what it actually did was made it

166
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,890
sound like we didn't want to help and I

167
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,299
was not good and finally turns out that

168
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,689
banks don't like it when you get

169
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:46,800
reported so event still had to go back

170
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:50,310
to the drawing board we decided to keep

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,729
the same spirit of this isn't actually

172
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,510
about the 1000

173
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:02,700
this is about the payment about the

174
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:05,040
credit card so we ask the customer the

175
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,770
details of their credit card with that

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,709
we can find it in our system count goes

177
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,530
we can fight the credit card we remove

178
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,450
it from the account the account goes in

179
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,640
what is called trial mode which means

180
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,730
for 30 more days the person will be able

181
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,050
to use it normally and after that it

182
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:28,230
gets frozen the information stays there

183
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,849
nothing gets touched or deleted but if

184
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,130
they want to continue to use it they

185
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,930
need to add on your credit card if we

186
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,000
can't find a credit card well there is

187
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:41,430
nothing we can do

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,410
either way we give the exact same answer

189
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,829
to the person who wrote in to us and

190
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,750
that is hi we can confirm that the

191
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,850
credit card you gave us information for

192
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,000
it's not in our systems from now on and

193
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,760
you won't see a charge anymore we don't

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,680
even reveal whether we did find the

195
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:08,240
account or not so that is a way that we

196
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:11,910
have found to deal with the payment part

197
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,180
without having to give information about

198
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,370
a loan password account interestingly

199
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,819
when it's a business like the first

200
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,430
example I gave they can get very pushy

201
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,700
hey just pretty please just tell me the

202
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,859
name I need to talk to them no I can't

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,930
stop it no no don't worry just give me

204
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,650
the name no that's not happening so we

205
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:40,800
have now seen two situations in which we

206
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:45,209
see every day where we have to further

207
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,640
verify people's identity beyond the

208
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,400
corruption case and in these two people

209
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,120
did not have access to the account for

210
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,880
the next two we do require people who

211
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,070
are talking to us to have access and

212
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:06,630
they are both related to GDP are the

213
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,240
first one is right to erasure or right

214
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,999
to be forgotten

215
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,529
gdpr says you have a right to leave a

216
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,930
system if you want a lot of companies

217
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,660
will collect a lot of your data you have

218
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,459
a right for that data to not be used for

219
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:29,429
the rest of forever if you're done with

220
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:32,040
them but deleting permanently data is

221
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:35,069
also pretty sensitive if you want to be

222
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,920
sure that the person really wants that

223
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,920
and understands what they're asking for

224
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,269
the amount of people that we hear that

225
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:49,529
soft deleted their one password account

226
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:52,199
on the regular tells us that yeah the

227
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:54,660
concept of delete there was not send a

228
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,189
message of permanent for a lot of the

229
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,600
people and with something with like

230
00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:06,149
passwords that's not a risk we can take

231
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:08,910
so what we have asked to do is go and

232
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,550
delete your one password account from an

233
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,439
authenticated session in other words

234
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,589
again the request has to kick out their

235
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,689
address registered to the account login

236
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:22,620
to one password give it the account

237
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:25,769
there let us know and then we can go

238
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,189
ahead and erase it and we're happy to do

239
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:33,300
that if that is met if the account has

240
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:35,160
already been deleted by the user from an

241
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,649
authenticated session this part is

242
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,490
important because it is possible to

243
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:43,110
delete an 1password account with just

244
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,249
access to the email address if you

245
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,189
didn't read it that way

246
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:49,319
we cannot go ahead with a full erasure

247
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:53,339
it has to be from an authenticated

248
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:56,579
session so this is how we deal with

249
00:12:53,339 --> 00:13:01,499
right of erasure the next one is right

250
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:04,709
of access I am sorry I wanted to show

251
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:07,999
the way that 98% of the request looks

252
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:11,790
like so I find it really interesting

253
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:15,600
there is this service that if you give

254
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:19,439
them full read and write access to your

255
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,660
email they will automatically send

256
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:23,480
emails to every

257
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:30,800
they can come up with asking to

258
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:32,960
permanently erase data forever please

259
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,760
note that I am NOT looking for

260
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,090
instructions on how to delete my account

261
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:42,410
I want you to delete all my data

262
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,970
buuuut is a request I find this line to

263
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:50,770
be extremely responsible this service is

264
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:54,110
sending automatic emails to hundreds of

265
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,900
services for this person and they just

266
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:01,100
want all of these services to completely

267
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:04,540
permanently nuke this data I think

268
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,850
that's exactly the kind of abuse that

269
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:11,030
the guy on the target blockhead was

270
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,830
talking about that not something that

271
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,350
anybody should be doing we should be

272
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,330
sure that people actually want to erase

273
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:22,850
their data into oblivion before doing

274
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:25,840
that okay now we can't actually go to

275
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:29,000
the right of access

276
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,600
ridox of access means you have a right

277
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,910
to know what we know about you in the

278
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,510
case of one password the answer is very

279
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:41,000
little we go through great lengths to

280
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,980
only ever collect like we absolutely

281
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,370
need to be able to give you the service

282
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,950
but that's not zero we are able to see

283
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,380
whatever name you've given to us which

284
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,390
does not have to be read your real name

285
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,200
you can be princess sparkles if you want

286
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,360
we don't care the email address that is

287
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,130
the key thing that is that there's a

288
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,630
reason why we use that as the main thing

289
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,430
to know that we're talking to the right

290
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:13,490
person we have some IPS we have some

291
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:17,089
device information we have a few details

292
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:19,550
and usage we have your profile picture a

293
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:23,540
few things like not going to just a

294
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:26,560
right to know what that is but also we

295
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:30,050
are not going to just give it all away

296
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,390
so again request needs to come from the

297
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,160
right email address but we need to know

298
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,430
that you can actually get into

299
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,910
about 1password to couch so well we have

300
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:44,839
come up with is we add one password

301
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,600
generate a code with one password and

302
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,689
ask you to change your name or last name

303
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,959
to it this code will be different for

304
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:57,469
each customer it's around this line and

305
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:02,750
then we can go into our back office

306
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:05,750
system and look at it if it matches you

307
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,959
have shown to us that you do have access

308
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,810
to that one password account and then we

309
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:16,399
can collect the data for you you give it

310
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,709
to you happily you let me tell you that

311
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:26,629
names almost easier to pronounce than my

312
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:29,508
full legal name so you might have

313
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:33,500
noticed for these you to GDP are related

314
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:37,610
requests the point is that the customer

315
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,279
needs to have access to the account gdpr

316
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,069
isn't clear on the few things for

317
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,709
example if you have forgotten your

318
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:47,509
master password

319
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:51,079
are we still supposed to give you all

320
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:55,339
information we have about you it might

321
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:58,729
be unclear for GDP are but Ferraris for

322
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:02,870
us it is pretty clear we are not going

323
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:07,579
to put our customers data and privacy at

324
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:09,819
risk trying to blindly follow a law that

325
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,948
has been designed to protect your stash

326
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,520
so unless you have access to your

327
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,260
account

328
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:22,299
we will not go forward so today we have

329
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:26,929
seen four different scenarios in which

330
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:30,289
we still have to further verify access

331
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:34,039
rights from people even if one password

332
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,850
is based on encryption when you're

333
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:42,890
dealing with humans you will find these

334
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,050
kinds of situations often so are you

335
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,050
anyway

336
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:52,349
thank you

337
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:52,349
