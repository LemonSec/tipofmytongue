1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:10,380
so take the Y Cecilia thank you

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:15,719
well yes I'm gonna talk about possible

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,910
integers and or mr. time this is a

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,730
review of paths MOU password managers

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,990
sorry or as most of you asked me what is

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,160
the best password manager it's it should

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,169
be difficult to answer explain so first

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,170
of all I'm gonna talk a little bit about

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,690
me and then I'm gonna explain a little

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,430
bit what is user friendly because you're

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,540
a very different crowd from my usual one

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,910
and I have to talk a little bit of what

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,890
do enterprises need because enterprise

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,169
needs are not the same as private user

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,820
needs or even small and medium business

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:57,800
needs you had a criteria and so on you

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,530
get the point first of all I like users

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,309
some of you yesterday over beer did the

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:11,549
thing the ritual the user ritual but I

20
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:15,780
actually like users I also love tech so

21
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm in a squeeze I have a background in

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:26,150
psychology more specific educational

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,500
psychology or pedagogics and then I

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,509
learned about actually I learn about

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,380
technology way before I did that but ok

26
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:37,470
I work as no a consultant sorry this is

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,009
early work is a consultant we'd know it

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,170
it's an enterprise it's an enterprise

29
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,090
involved in almost kinda Navy I bought

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,310
in Norway Sweden Denmark and so on and

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,610
Finland sorry I will not forget about

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,689
Finland and I mostly work with testing

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:59,090
or test management or whatever testing

34
00:01:53,689 --> 00:02:01,889
so user friendly what is user friendly

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,420
how do you measure something user

36
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,848
friendly or how do I measure something

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:11,670
user friendly well first of all I could

38
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,079
have considered the password managers up

39
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,899
against a hug

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:22,380
- oh the framework for HTML or I could

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,600
have looked at regulations or looked at

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,500
accessibility and did a little bit of

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,200
that but most of all I looked about what

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,200
is going on and what do the users need

45
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:41,010
and sometimes it's very obvious what the

46
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:44,730
users need and sometimes not so so it

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,130
was pretty straightforward I looked

48
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,530
well I asked friends and colleagues and

49
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,390
other people what kind of password

50
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,890
managers do you use - what kind of

51
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,480
password managers do you know of and

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,630
then I looked them up do they have a

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,869
business or Enterprise Solution a few of

54
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,780
them did some did not

55
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,880
some say they did but do not really

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,620
don't yeah and I start doing this last

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,410
year because I attended this conference

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,650
last year and had all this awesome talks

59
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,180
and somebody said you know I really wish

60
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,070
I knew what kind of password managers

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,570
that were user friendly and I figured

62
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:27,150
you know that's my cue I can do that so

63
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:33,329
I started looking into things last year

64
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:35,430
like a year from a year ago and the

65
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,590
password mattress I've had to redo my

66
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,810
work a lot of times this year because

67
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,850
this is a really volatile time for

68
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,060
password managers it's not set its

69
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:51,090
browser Wars all over again things are

70
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,500
not defined yet there are online

71
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,180
password managers there are offline

72
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,580
password managers there are password

73
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,500
managers that obviously is meant for

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,330
private individual

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,470
there are password managers meant for

76
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:07,800
business only but really the password

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,320
managers that do take both the private

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:16,730
user and the business into account is

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,730
the one that I find most interesting yes

80
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:24,800
this is a picture from a New Eden

81
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
newspaper article

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:36,140
they did an investigation into a leaked

83
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,790
database to try to figure out what's in

84
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,039
there is there anything interesting or

85
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,750
relevant at all to Norway and they did

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,850
find something interesting irrelevant to

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,340
Norway for you who not Norwegian or

88
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,640
Swedish politi it from tomorrow is the

89
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:55,640
police in Norway and Milly dot I know is

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,770
military email addresses and what's over

91
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,210
here it may not be very very clear but

92
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,210
these are the password that they have

93
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:14,720
let's see there was one that was really

94
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:18,080
fun yeah okay so private users use their

95
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,800
business email accounts and quite

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,310
possibly also business email no business

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,420
passwords now most user I talked to they

98
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,070
swear they have a system all of them

99
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,900
swear they have a system or they have a

100
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,599
system where they only reused like weak

101
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,780
password and weak services and strong no

102
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,180
they don't because at some point they

103
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,320
forget themselves of something happened

104
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:49,010
and so on and a lot of businesses they

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,830
only care about the the situation that

106
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,740
is going on the workplace and they say

107
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,450
you know what we can't interfere or care

108
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,850
about what people do in their private

109
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,770
life its private and I appreciate that

110
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,820
they're trying to respect the privacy of

111
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:08,299
their workers but really it is a

112
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,330
business problem that your users don't

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,340
know better or don't have the tools to

114
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,659
support a better password practice I'm

115
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:24,130
pretty sure the police and the military

116
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:27,200
is looking into password managers now so

117
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,490
Enterprise what do they need because a

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,140
lot of the password managers that I

119
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,990
looked at they definitely want a piece

120
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,610
of the enterprise business it's easy

121
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,789
billing and

122
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,639
more money and it's less customer

123
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:44,389
service than with individual users so I

124
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,970
get that but a pathway an enterprise by

125
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:51,099
provisioning not just collective billing

126
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,690
they also need proper provisioning

127
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:57,199
managing the users getting them in there

128
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,419
so you can't just say that ok you can

129
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,099
buy one big license for your company

130
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,650
that you have to give them something

131
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:07,490
else as well so that's on the criteria

132
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:10,460
for how to pick a parcel manager safe

133
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,550
sharing in teams we are still in the

134
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,810
situation where collective passwords are

135
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:20,930
in use there are routers and servers and

136
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:24,560
so on that do not have the possibility

137
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,139
to have individual password management

138
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,449
there sorry user management so you end

139
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,080
up with a collective license and then

140
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:37,370
there's bad habits and so on but doesn't

141
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,710
matter teams share passwords we have to

142
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,870
respect that what they do and what they

143
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:48,680
should do different thing and you wanna

144
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,590
you really want to make sure that you

145
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,860
have work passwords separate from

146
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:59,690
private accounts because you don't want

147
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,849
to mix them and you definitely want to

148
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,770
monitor the quality you want to know if

149
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,400
this investment was worth your money is

150
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:12,130
it improving its the quality or in the

151
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,130
security of your users improving

152
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:18,699
documentation and self health material

153
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,560
not all password managers may need this

154
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:25,580
but if you're looking at yourself as a

155
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,529
like off-the-shelf product you may want

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,810
to make sure that this is good and if

157
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:33,260
you're looking into buying a password

158
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,969
manager consider this as I if it's not

159
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,490
good documentation and Southworth

160
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,909
material you need to consider the cost

161
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,010
of development developing it yourself so

162
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,968
if you go for like instance an open

163
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,819
source solution

164
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:48,510
I keep pass

165
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,450
there are some but it's not a

166
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,640
off-the-shelf product so even though you

167
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:59,580
save a lot of money on licenses you may

168
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,580
have to spend money on putting on the

169
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,439
making the documentation and also

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:11,589
putting on a better front end for your

171
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,870
user in so I local language matters not

172
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:17,020
everybody is very good at speaking

173
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,390
English today not even I'm I am good at

174
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,630
speaking English so you know we all may

175
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:25,449
have a bad day and especially if your

176
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,210
users are not using English as their

177
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:37,840
working language local languages matters

178
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:39,610
and machine translated security now this

179
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,430
is the point where you sort of end up

180
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,510
with a trade-off between security and

181
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:49,180
usability because if you're gonna have

182
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,160
proper paranoid security your usability

183
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,959
goes down because it means that you end

184
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,290
up with a solution that is an offline

185
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:02,890
password manager simple as that for a

186
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:07,890
lot of companies having online password

187
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,890
management could be a very good trade of

188
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,040
laws and regulations gdpr is applies to

189
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,210
the European Union and a lot of the

190
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,610
other countries connected to the

191
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,290
European Union there may be other local

192
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:26,920
laws and regulations that affect you

193
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:29,800
make sure that you are compliant so this

194
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,860
is I because all the products that I

195
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,130
looked at they were very different in so

196
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,900
many ways I try making sense of them so

197
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,410
this is how I try making sense of them I

198
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:47,439
put them up and okay is that are they

199
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:49,900
reasonably Enterprise like yes and no a

200
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:56,080
lot of them says no because they're off

201
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:57,910
line products and some are just no no it

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,300
doesn't matter I'll get out I'll show

203
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,300
you why

204
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:07,599
price matters when you're buying a

205
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,240
license for let's say 30 people price

206
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,709
don't matter that much but when you're

207
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,329
buying license for thousands even a few

208
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:24,219
cents may matter

209
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:26,469
luckily for a lot of the big ones prices

210
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,379
a point of negotiation if you have a lot

211
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:35,019
of users your cost will change so just

212
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,939
just talk to them I know a lot of people

213
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,160
hate it when the price is not set in the

214
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,269
beginning but try talking to the company

215
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,120
if you're a big one

216
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,730
if not you can assume that the next

217
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,079
level of pricing which is for businesses

218
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:53,470
is close to where you're at platform's

219
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:57,969
matter and now we're getting into the

220
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:02,680
usability because if I'm as a user is

221
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:05,649
going to invest my time and patient into

222
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,309
this software that my job told me to do

223
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:12,730
and use I want to make sure that it's

224
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:16,410
worth my time and if it's only on one my

225
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,750
work machine or rather have a system I

226
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:23,139
hate what people have systems but I get

227
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:26,319
why they choose not you so pay attention

228
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:28,149
to the quality of your passwords that

229
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:30,219
you have in their business before you

230
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:33,550
get a password manager pay also

231
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,069
attention to onboarding how many people

232
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,709
are on board compared to what you expect

233
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,569
because if not a lot of people get on

234
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:47,319
board with your program you may be doing

235
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:49,449
something wrong yes I also had that's

236
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,670
the short version of the UX I'm gonna

237
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,829
talk more navigate you the individual

238
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,128
point of it

239
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:58,689
some UX is easy to navigate you you you

240
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:02,610
understand very clearly what you're

241
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:05,290
doing and what is going on some

242
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,829
solutions like key pass is definitely

243
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,520
more demanding you the audience for this

244
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:15,849
is

245
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:18,460
technical people and then I tried

246
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,560
figuring out password manager Pro but it

247
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:27,700
was actually so difficult to install and

248
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:31,540
get a trial running that I gave up most

249
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,630
means more than Mac ving iOS and Android

250
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,790
and then there's bit warden

251
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,130
I like bit warden it has all the

252
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,390
platforms even platforms I haven't heard

253
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,390
of and that's rare

254
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:51,430
so onboarding this is the first meeting

255
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,640
your users will have with the password

256
00:13:51,430 --> 00:14:00,520
manager so onboarding is super important

257
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:05,620
the tone of voice that the that they're

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:08,770
meeting matters a lot and then there's

259
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,990
both boring and off-boarding matters a

260
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,510
bit to the users because they want to

261
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,050
know that their time and effort is well

262
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,910
invested I will accept that sometimes

263
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,020
the user don't really care because when

264
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,810
they leave they're not going to touch a

265
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,430
computer again but most of the times if

266
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,560
they put all their passwords into this

267
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,640
basket that you gave them they want to

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,819
make sure that they can take their

269
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,400
private stuff and go off boarding is

270
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,900
also super important for businesses in

271
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,420
the cases that we don't want to talk

272
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:42,310
about the cases of the unfaithful

273
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:45,579
servants and that is also a good good

274
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,650
reason to make sure that you can move

275
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,940
them out of your system let them take

276
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,709
their password with them

277
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,000
you don't know if they've put their

278
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,480
business password in their private

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,980
account that's just a thing and then

280
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,920
discreetly update the passwords that

281
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,410
that person used to have access to and

282
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,420
that is super important because the case

283
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,790
may not be closed and you definitely

284
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,310
want to don't want to tell everybody at

285
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,120
the company that you know we the person

286
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:15,520
who just left

287
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,690
may have been a unfaithful servant you

288
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:24,280
want to keep that on their lid until

289
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:27,400
things are done just you know let him go

290
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,319
properly with their passwords and update

291
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:36,130
what you don't left recovery

292
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:40,210
how many recoveries are there first day

293
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:44,380
after summer vacation a lot why because

294
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:47,740
people do forget their password recovery

295
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:50,650
matters unfortunately a lot of the

296
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,480
solutions that are offline don't really

297
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,090
have a recovery process they say you

298
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,580
know I'm sorry but we're very very

299
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,200
secure so there is no way who can you

300
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,690
recover your password if it forgot it

301
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,850
and I understand from a security point

302
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:08,290
of view if you need that paranoid level

303
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:11,080
of security fine but if you don't please

304
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,630
look at the recovery solution because

305
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,980
your normal everyday user is going to

306
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:20,170
need it and if you tell them I'm sorry

307
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,260
we don't have a recovery solution you

308
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,060
will have to start all over collecting

309
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,350
your password and putting it into this

310
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:37,239
software do you think they will I don't

311
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:38,770
think anyone will I wouldn't it has to

312
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,350
be easy to add the password in the right

313
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:46,620
place and just that's just pure hygiene

314
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,900
search has to be implemented and

315
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,120
possible to do I didn't have problem

316
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,459
with any of the password managers search

317
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,380
which is good but whenever you're

318
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,950
reviewing a password manager for your

319
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,860
company with your specific needs have a

320
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:06,459
look at the search platforms I already

321
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:09,010
mentioned matters and it's also good if

322
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:12,550
the software is helpful in the right way

323
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:15,910
I love that the soft my password manager

324
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,879
checks for leaks from the Hammerman porn

325
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:21,760
database and so on I love that it tells

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,010
me you know what did you know that

327
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,859
you've you reused your password on these

328
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,950
two places it's wonderful it makes me a

329
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:32,770
better human very discretely and helpful

330
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,380
it's not so nice when it's helpful the

331
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:40,490
wrong way

332
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:43,610
like auto-filling the password are being

333
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,580
generated has to be manageable because

334
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,830
while most of the time you're just gonna

335
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,419
copy it from the password manager it's

336
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,360
even being like click and then fill out

337
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,970
you will end up in situations where you

338
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,270
need to type it manually for instance on

339
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,990
your TV or because at this moment it's

340
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:06,200
not just not possible to copy directly

341
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:12,760
so it has to be easy to see the password

342
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:17,180
and type it so I removed some of the

343
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:20,510
options that are not options and I how

344
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,510
did I try to set it up like onboarding

345
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:28,420
off-boarding recovery and so on

346
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:32,360
and most are okay but not all of them

347
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,590
and now I wish I could film you now

348
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,510
because now I'm going to show you a

349
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:42,110
quote this is the quote can you read it

350
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:45,440
okay this is about the recovery process

351
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:48,590
of a password manager and because by the

352
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,420
way nobody's paying for this I'm not

353
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,730
affiliated with any of the password

354
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,860
managers so I don't have a problem with

355
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,720
naming and shaming X script for saying

356
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,600
this about password recovery they are

357
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,250
saying all that being said covering your

358
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,740
possible case where we could possibly

359
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,030
help you because essentially they say we

360
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,600
can't help you with recovering your

361
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:10,730
password if you think your password you

362
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,919
think you know your password but not

363
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:18,200
quite or if it's less than five

364
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:20,780
characters long then we can write and

365
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,150
adapt a special program that will try

366
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,879
many combinations automatically this is

367
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,610
called a brute-force attack I don't ever

368
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,550
want to know I have a suggester like

369
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,159
this there's so many wrote things wrong

370
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,889
with this and in essence I don't trust

371
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,860
this provider at all things like less

372
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,670
than five characters long and our

373
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,149
recovery solution is a brute-force

374
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,310
attack no so they say they have

375
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,240
addresses but they don't and this keeps

376
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,399
happening I

377
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,269
when I was looking into things they

378
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:56,139
don't really have an enterprise solution

379
00:19:52,269 --> 00:20:02,360
they have an enterprise billing solution

380
00:19:56,139 --> 00:20:04,758
yes so now to the interesting part the

381
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,320
best but I will also do some honorable

382
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,429
mentions and I will start with them

383
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,519
because we're gonna end up having

384
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:13,100
questions after I'm pretty sure first of

385
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,169
all key pass key pass is an offline

386
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,600
solution it's an open source solution

387
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:21,440
it's not super user friendly at this

388
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,678
point but that's also the point you have

389
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:30,499
no license cost would keep us and it's a

390
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:32,240
wonderful thing to do comparison against

391
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:34,820
when you're looking at other solution

392
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,529
look at key pass to measure what do I

393
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:41,809
get for my money because it is also

394
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,129
because it's open source possible to say

395
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,440
that you know what we're just gonna use

396
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:52,369
the key pass as a core and develop our

397
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:55,399
own glazing on top key pass was added to

398
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:57,408
the EU bug bounty program last year so

399
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,119
the security of key pass in addition to

400
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:03,409
being an offline password manager is

401
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,029
being hardened as we speak I'm very

402
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,519
interested to see what kind of solution

403
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:09,499
that would come out of this I have see

404
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,679
some are built on key paths and then

405
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:14,450
they made it prettier and so on but I

406
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,779
think 2020 will be a very interesting

407
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:21,259
year in many ways disadvantages

408
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:24,950
demanding UX significant self effort to

409
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:29,090
make it suitable for your business and

410
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:32,149
there's no audit and that goes for all

411
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:35,480
the offline password managers you don't

412
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:37,959
really have an audit which is why it's

413
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,179
problematic for a lot of companies

414
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,850
f-secure key is a bundled product so I

415
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,909
didn't really want to review it at all

416
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,439
because you have to buy and then with

417
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,379
something else and it was difficult to

418
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,940
review because then I did you know

419
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:56,539
however I did tell people that I was

420
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,580
doing this review and the users that

421
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:00,179
they came with some user over to me and

422
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,220
they're like oh

423
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,830
you're not doing f-secure password

424
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,110
manager acid well I don't know yet like

425
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,639
this and this thing but so much and

426
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,049
usually when I people tell me about

427
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,399
their password manager they say oh I

428
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:12,929
like this and these things but I

429
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:15,389
hastened these things and by the way

430
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:17,879
this is annoying me but the five

431
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:21,209
f-secure users that came over and talked

432
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:23,309
to me during this year all loved it so

433
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,950
much they didn't even care that it

434
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:29,428
didn't support all their platforms and

435
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:32,669
didn't have a private vault which is

436
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:34,710
rare so I haven't reviewed it but I

437
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:38,850
think I should mention it just because

438
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,590
of that then there's - line - line I

439
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,539
started looking at Ashland last year it

440
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,399
was a bundled product at the time with a

441
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:46,259
VPN solution it was super expensive

442
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:49,709
difficult to understand what what they

443
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:51,269
were doing so I decided not to but they

444
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,769
have changed their pricing model the

445
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:59,039
last year to something that makes sense

446
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:04,049
and it's way cheaper and their own

447
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,249
boring process is really nice like the

448
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,110
next one I'm going to mention one

449
00:23:05,249 --> 00:23:09,960
password their onboarding is also nice

450
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,748
but this one was even better and I

451
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,249
didn't think that would happen they

452
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:15,960
still have a little bit confusing price

453
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,960
mold and I think they're gonna change it

454
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,149
again I don't know and their free model

455
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,419
which is part of the off-boarding part

456
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:32,039
is extremely limited that's annoying

457
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:37,039
yeah very important you can navigate the

458
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:42,360
Ashland by only using keyboard and

459
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:44,730
that's part of accessibility the next

460
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,830
one one password

461
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,869
you cannot navigate it by only using

462
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:53,330
keyboard well you can but it's sort of

463
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:53,330
like a lottery so it's not good for that

464
00:23:54,499 --> 00:24:05,830
are you making notes good

465
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,139
also they have a big fan base especially

466
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,750
because they had an offline solution but

467
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,810
I think it's being discontinued I don't

468
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:17,110
know but people are annoyed because of

469
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:20,139
it already existing users are annoyed

470
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:23,290
for me as a new user I would know about

471
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:28,570
this so I'm not sure if I care

472
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:30,730
sorry existing users it's well known its

473
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,490
especially well known among Mac people

474
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,640
because I swear - light it comes from an

475
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:41,080
iOS world which means that the interface

476
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:44,320
is beautiful it has a very lot of

477
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,169
interesting and relevant features and I

478
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,540
like that they are very among other

479
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:53,190
things in touch with community and shows

480
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:57,659
up on events like this and has been

481
00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:03,790
adapting new good ideas fast like the

482
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:07,600
integration with well-known URL so now

483
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,940
it's LastPass I just spot exists at some

484
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,230
point I'm sorry

485
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,900
LastPass is users what kind of

486
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,420
fortunately I know of companies who said

487
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,770
ok we're going to ask our users what

488
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,080
kind of password manager they use

489
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,540
privately and just pick the one that

490
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,949
most people have most people have lost

491
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,629
past because they have a very good free

492
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:31,750
solution or good enough free solution

493
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:34,770
for private users it doesn't make them

494
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:38,790
the best password managers for business

495
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:41,020
but I'll I'll I'll take the good first

496
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:45,370
they do support a lot of platforms

497
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:48,210
really they have a lot of features and

498
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:54,010
they have very good documentation and

499
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:56,110
self health material they do their tone

500
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,980
of voice when you're being on boarded is

501
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,080
a bit technical

502
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,780
it may not be offensive but it's

503
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,439
definitely not welcoming if you're not a

504
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,180
technical user it's a bit like when when

505
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,520
I got the email I was thinking oh I'm

506
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:15,300
gonna do the IT people a favor now by

507
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:19,080
doing this thing you know recover

508
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:22,340
we lost fast has significant flaws and

509
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,280
I'll talk more about it in a minute but

510
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,689
this is why I'm so disappointed the last

511
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,060
was because I really wanted them to be

512
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,940
good because I wanted to have two three

513
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:35,970
good options to give you when you ask

514
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:42,060
what is the best password manager but

515
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:45,180
recovery is so important so no because

516
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:47,580
of their errors with the recovery

517
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,560
solution it is now incompatible with

518
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,659
what's called a zero trust architecture

519
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,800
I am assuming you are familiar with the

520
00:26:51,660 --> 00:27:00,150
concept please not if you are familiar

521
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:02,220
ok I'll get back to that then I tried

522
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,830
telling them about the flaws in their

523
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,100
recovery solution it was not welcome I

524
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,540
tried a lot they were still not taking

525
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,740
feedback and then I talked to other

526
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,960
people saying that you know what

527
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,380
LastPass they never take feedback from

528
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,760
the community and that is a bad thing

529
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,180
because even though you have a closed

530
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,370
bug bounty program other people's gonna

531
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,840
see your product with their eyes and

532
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,300
discover things and you definitely

533
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:31,679
didn't want that kind of feedback it's

534
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:34,830
gonna cost you in managing feedbacks but

535
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,700
it's worth it and also I was annoyed

536
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:42,780
when I asked him about dot well-known

537
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,760
URL and they answered you know we'll see

538
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,100
if it becomes the standard I don't want

539
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,379
to have that laid-back like wait-and-see

540
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,270
attitude when it comes to my password

541
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,300
manager I really wanted them to be in

542
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:57,750
the front defining password managers and

543
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,460
at the moment they're not and again

544
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,620
20/20 is gonna be interesting because

545
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,810
both dash line and one password just

546
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:07,229
acquired a bunch of money so they're

547
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:10,110
stepping it up this is an example I

548
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,910
think don't think you can read it but

549
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,510
this is an example of dashed lines

550
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:18,420
onboarding that says you've been invited

551
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,340
to join a company name at the time I

552
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,370
that I gave is via that I know it's in

553
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,649
my last name on dashed line like come

554
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,689
and join us and the other was on your

555
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,400
company has partnered with LastPass I

556
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,520
don't

557
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,830
who my company partners with and the

558
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,480
email is super long and it's invited and

559
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:40,580
is technical and so on so you know it's

560
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:47,690
not a disaster it's just not as good as

561
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:50,810
the other two are you ready okay

562
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,750
so recovery with LastPass business

563
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:56,600
solution or enterprise solution is that

564
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:00,110
your company takes over the recovery

565
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,050
responsibility LastPass doesn't because

566
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:09,709
they have a policy of not knowing your

567
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:12,669
password great this is me and I lost my

568
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:16,220
password so I'm calling customer service

569
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:17,270
we don't see each other that's line I'm

570
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,600
calling on the phone the customer

571
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:22,190
service and say hi this is a senior I've

572
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,620
lost that password can you please

573
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,680
recover it and of course customer

574
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,290
services sure push the button there's an

575
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:35,330
email or SMS or whatever that your setup

576
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:38,720
goes out and I get a new password or

577
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,449
password late that's okay I would be

578
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,120
happy with this solution but that's not

579
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:49,040
what's going on what's going on is hi I

580
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,889
know my password the password that I

581
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,930
want and then I'm calling customer

582
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,430
service and I tell them could you

583
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,200
recover my account and the customer

584
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,760
services sure and I says you know what I

585
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,860
have an idea for what kind of past what

586
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,220
I want could you just set Internet

587
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:09,620
organize you in Italy and the customer

588
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:14,090
service person says sure types in my new

589
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:17,719
password that I just told them sends out

590
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:19,610
an email I'm not fine with that I don't

591
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,990
want them to know and this is the

592
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,879
problem with the Serie trust model

593
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,420
they're not supposed to know my password

594
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,530
and of course I talked to a LastPass on

595
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,240
the site you can turn off this feature

596
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,830
but a business feature without a

597
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,380
recovery solution is not sufficient so

598
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:40,179
very shortly what questions do you have

599
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,180
and I'll take comments after
