1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,560
so dear friends ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,520
delighted to

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,399
participate in this uh sixth edition of

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,279
the munich

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
cyber security conference sorry for the

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,480
delay

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
um lujanza was three and a half hours

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,759
late but

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
here we are you know just uh now

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920
more secure resilient digital society

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,240
what a topic and what a challenge

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
not so long ago cyber security was

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,840
considered

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,320
as a technical issue by many businesses

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,239
some governments used to treat it solely

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,840
as a subset

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
of national security today it is a

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,719
pressing global challenge

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
with extensive social and economic

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,160
implications

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,879
requiring collective actions by

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,079
governments

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,440
companies and the public i therefore

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,920
congratulate the organizers for getting

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
us

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
all together here today the world is

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,199
becoming increasingly

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,400
dependent on digital technologies

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
while this may be self-evident

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,600
it's our job at the oecd to measure

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
the digital transformation understand

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
the implications

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,840
and recommend public policy approaches

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,479
that are appropriate for this

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,400
transformation

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
in 2018 60 64

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,159
actually of internet users in oecd

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,040
countries

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
made online purchases 73

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
used social networks uh 68

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,439
used online banking so a very

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,360
significant increase

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,799
over you know of the this grows

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
exponentially so we're in an economy

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,119
that is

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
increasingly digitalized and we should

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,119
act accordingly

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
we are now confronted with a very

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
big challenge for example on how to tax

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
the digital economy not the digital

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
companies by the way

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,599
but the digital economy and to the

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,480
extent that it

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,440
is becoming increasingly digitalized of

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
course ministers of finance

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
are seeing their their

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
taxable base shrink unless we

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
actually get a way to do it so

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
everywhere you see the process is

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,440
generating challenges

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
in addition the digital transformation

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,480
is touching our lives in

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,080
new ways the digitalization of election

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
systems here um christie was mentioning

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,120
some of the challenges that come up and

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,080
you were mentioning

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
um tyson the question of

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
well you know how do we deal with

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,000
democracy

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
in the face of digitalization

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,720
healthcare smart homes

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
connected cars this

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
this whole transformation despite being

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,720
full of promises

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,840
also makes us more and more dependent

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
and to some extent vulnerable to digital

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
security threats

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
the wannacry the not petty

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,959
attacks in 2017 for example showed how

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,680
the

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
successful exploitation of a

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
vulnerability

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,560
in a single product can actually

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
paralyze global firms

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,319
and lead to billions of damages

86
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
billions of dollars in damages and

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
threatened critical infrastructures

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,720
but also have direct human impact

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
digital security incidents like these

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,239
have taught us a lot

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
over the years businesses have realized

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
that digital security needs to move up

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,280
from the

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
i.t team to the boardroom

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
policymakers recognize the need for

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
digital security to become a whole of

97
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
government priority

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
with integrated strategies that

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
encourage digital security innovation

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,440
develop relevant skills and empower

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,238
small

102
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,320
and medium enterprises in individuals

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
these are marks of progress

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
and they're welcome but the mission to

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
build a safer

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,280
more resilient digital world must

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
advance

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
and keep pace with the change

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,759
of the digital transformation itself

110
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,680
and it's a rapid face i can say you know

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
typically the regulators are always

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,360
kind of chasing the regulated okay

113
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
in this business by the time the

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
regulators arrive

115
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
you know the regulated are gone they're

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,800
you know

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
you don't even see the dust

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,440
that they left you know so we always

119
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
take principles we always take broad

120
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,160
brush strokes rather than try to be very

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,199
specific

122
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,919
in the regulatory approach simply

123
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,960
because

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
we are convinced at the oecd no matter

125
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,240
what

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
we uh you know when we advise our

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,880
our our member countries they say listen

128
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
there's absolutely nothing you can do in

129
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
terms of the um

130
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
of the very detailed regulation

131
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
but basically if you have a set of

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
principles and you have a framework

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
then you will do better in terms of

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,560
seeing whether it fits or it doesn't fit

135
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
now artificial intelligence for example

136
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,639
has an immense

137
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
potential to improve the well-being of

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
people help

139
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,720
solve some of the major challenges of

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
our times

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
but it can also enhance digital security

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
by detecting anomalies

143
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
it also comes however

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
with new risks for example researchers

145
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,639
have shown that data can be poisoned

146
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,720
to deceive an ai system

147
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
now are we ready for this type of

148
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,919
challenge

149
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
where should we start the principles

150
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,120
adopted

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,800
last year by the oecd and actually

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
were then borrowed

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,039
it's an elegant word by the g20 we were

154
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,639
delighted that they

155
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,680
took them as as theirs uh we're

156
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
we're happy that they adopted those same

157
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
principles

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
and now it's called the g20 principles

159
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,039
which is

160
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,840
we we work with the g20 very closely all

161
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
the time

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
but they recommend that ai systems be

163
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,840
secure

164
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,039
safe throughout their entire life cycles

165
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,319
the traceability of outcomes be ensured

166
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
and that a systematic risk management

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,039
approach be applied

168
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,880
there's an urgent need to implement

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,160
these principles

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
and to address emerging threats such as

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,520
deep fakes and misinformation

172
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
of failing and learning from our

173
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
mistakes

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,160
is one of the most important success

175
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
factors

176
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,720
in developing businesses actually

177
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
it's a very important success factor in

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
life

179
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,160
risk-taking and economic success

180
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
go hand-in-hand

181
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,639
as we recognize in our 2015

182
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,280
recommendation

183
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
on digital security risk management

184
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,440
when i say recommendation it looks like

185
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
well we're saying it's a good idea it

186
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,599
says

187
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
in the oecd it has a kind of a legal

188
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
implication it's the highest

189
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
level of things it becomes kind of

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,319
mandatory

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,000
and everybody all the members should

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
adopt it and you know this is when

193
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
you sign on to it it's kind of a it's

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,759
kind of a big you know it's a big hard

195
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,720
capital r

196
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
so the recommendation on digital

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,240
security risk management

198
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
the objective was to build a resilient

199
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
digital society

200
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,680
not to eliminate risks entirely

201
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
we believe this is simply impossible

202
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
but to manage risks to reduce them to an

203
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,958
acceptable level

204
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,000
smart products are not smart enough to

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,880
be 100

206
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,320
safe attacks will happen

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
and some of the attacks may be

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
successful

209
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
what matters is to be prepared

210
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
to detect that the attacks actually

211
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
happened

212
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,440
and respond adequately

213
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
the resilience our ability to ensure

214
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
continuity recover from hardships

215
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
should be top of mind

216
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
a recent survey showed that 27 of

217
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
organizations suffered security breaches

218
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,320
because

219
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,760
of an unpatched vulnerability

220
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,560
that means the problem wasn't fixed

221
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
many products including

222
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
maybe your smartphones and continue to

223
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
be used after their end of life

224
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
and this means that the manufacturer no

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
longer provides technical support

226
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,160
including the security updates

227
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
so after that you're kind of

228
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,640
you know you're vulnerable

229
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
and it means um therefore that

230
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,320
you know criminals never sleep

231
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,839
they never give up they just keep trying

232
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
so criminals will continue to attack

233
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
relentlessly and you no longer have the

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,279
defense

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,560
and you probably are not even aware

236
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,040
so with the number of connected devices

237
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
expected to

238
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,560
reach what is it 20 billion i think it's

239
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,120
almost a cliche by now

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,200
this year the end of life challenge

241
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,920
is literally a ticking time bomb

242
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
now with the advancement of the internet

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,360
of things

244
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,399
and cyber physical systems successful

245
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,519
attacks

246
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
will also increasingly impact human

247
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
safety

248
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,839
because it's about things not just about

249
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,079
information

250
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,800
for connected pacemakers

251
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
autonomous autonomous vehicles for

252
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,160
example

253
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
things that are there that you know well

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,079
when you're talking failing safe means

255
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,560
you know failed safe means that you live

256
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
and that if you fail you don't you know

257
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
it's

258
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
it's a life or death issue

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,360
in many cases products

260
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
are not secure enough why

261
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
well is it only because of the

262
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
technology

263
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
our current work shows that the market

264
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,360
often fails to provide enough incentives

265
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
across economic actors

266
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
in response some governments

267
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
are developing labels with

268
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,079
the cooperation of the private sector to

269
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,880
increase transparency promote security

270
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,839
as a factor that actually differentiates

271
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,959
products

272
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,518
in the market

273
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
we at the oecd we're trying to help

274
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
governments build more secure

275
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,079
more resilient societies and economies

276
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,000
actually since a munich cyber security

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,360
conference

278
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
was first launched the oecd developed

279
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
international legal instruments on

280
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,160
digital security

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,839
in 2015 we adopted the again

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
recommendation on digital security risk

283
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
management for economic

284
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,639
and social prosperity it was a very long

285
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,200
name not very sticky but you know you

286
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,920
get

287
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,279
the gist of what it was about

288
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
in 2019 no because we our best seller

289
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
ever

290
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,639
was one about obesity

291
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,360
big fat research about obesity and

292
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
somebody

293
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,950
and you know everybody said oh

294
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,519
[Music]

295
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,600
but somebody had this brilliant idea of

296
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,639
calling it

297
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
fit not fat and it sold like crazy it's

298
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,560
still selling you know just still it was

299
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
published 10 years ago so the title is

300
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
important

301
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,120
this this this we did not get a very

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
sexy title but anyway the content is

303
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,639
very important here

304
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,200
you know in 2019 we actually adopted

305
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,399
another recommendation the

306
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
recommendation on digital

307
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,079
security of critical activities

308
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,320
it calls for sustainable and trust-based

309
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
partnerships

310
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,040
among all stakeholders we also launched

311
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
at the oecd the global forum on digital

312
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,519
security for prosperity

313
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,880
which is connected to this

314
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
recommendation which connects

315
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,760
technical experts with policy leaders to

316
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,639
focus

317
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
on the economic and social aspects of

318
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
digital security

319
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
we met london last year to identify

320
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
successful strategies to encourage

321
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,120
digital security innovation

322
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
next week experts will meet at the oecd

323
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,639
in paris to identify and discuss

324
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,920
best practices in product security

325
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
and the responsible management of

326
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,880
vulnerabilities and we will actually

327
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,079
meet again later this year in

328
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
israel so i invite you to

329
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
join us there and next year we will

330
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,199
review our

331
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,880
guidelines on cryptography

332
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,399
policy cryptography policy

333
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
these were old now they're they were

334
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
adopted in 97.

335
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,199
so it's kind of a you know anything that

336
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,720
is adopted in 97 in this kind of context

337
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,079
is like you know ancient

338
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
history but um we kind of upgraded and

339
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,199
then and updated them and

340
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,399
you know this um but um

341
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,760
but uh these these uh cryptography

342
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
uh policies or these uh this

343
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
these guidelines um

344
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
they uh make the first international

345
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,800
consensus

346
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
on the deregulation of cryptography

347
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
which as you know is

348
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
a foundational best practice to

349
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
enhance the security of digital

350
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,839
communications and transactions

351
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
and we're

352
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,480
continuing to develop it and to

353
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
modernize it to upgrade it to update it

354
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,440
now stepping back we should be asking

355
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
ourselves a simple question

356
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,759
is digital security improving

357
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,880
well the answer is

358
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,639
complex lord kelvin said

359
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
if you cannot measure it you cannot

360
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,800
improve it

361
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,240
our challenge is to move from anecdote

362
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,160
to building a very strong

363
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,639
evidence base this is our mandate

364
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
but to gather data we need more

365
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
involvement from businesses

366
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,720
and from governments so dear friends

367
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,600
as was the last message that christy

368
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
uh shared with us a moment ago she said

369
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
you know we need to do it with you in

370
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
this particular case

371
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,440
to build these databases to deal this

372
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
information to

373
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
to build uh you know these these

374
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
common defenses uh we do

375
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
need to join forces from innovative

376
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,279
business leaders courageous policy

377
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,480
makers

378
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,199
the technical community already

379
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,759
many of you are acting brave you're

380
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,839
championing digital security across

381
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
companies sectors countries

382
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
you even get paid for it which is

383
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
a good idea so

384
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,519
what i say is let's help

385
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
each other you know we are

386
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,839
we advise governments uh the problem

387
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,199
that advising government is you're

388
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,839
supposed to

389
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,039
know more than they do and on this

390
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,839
business every day things are happening

391
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,119
so fast

392
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,480
you are making changes so fast

393
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
that we are fighting it you know finding

394
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,760
it very very difficult to

395
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,839
catch up with you but at the same time

396
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,360
we again have to tell what the

397
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,720
government should be doing with the

398
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,520
digital transformation

399
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
now the um

400
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,720
the paris call for trust and security in

401
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,440
cyberspace

402
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,200
and the charter of trust

403
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
launched here at the munich

404
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,880
security conference two years ago are

405
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
great examples

406
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,960
of what stakeholders can achieve if they

407
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,559
act together

408
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,000
so let's work together learning from our

409
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
country's successes

410
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
learning from our country's mistakes

411
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,200
identifying

412
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,559
and sharing best practices designing

413
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,400
evidence-based policies and regulations

414
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
in the end it's the oecd's mission

415
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
so i wish you all a great conference

416
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:29,840
thank you very much
