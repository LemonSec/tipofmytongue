1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,360
this is my first munich conference

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,839
and i'm delighted to be here on behalf

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,839
of the european commission

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,639
and this year the conference comes right

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,599
at the time

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,200
when the new political cycle in brussels

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,960
is kicking into full gear

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
last year this conference was opened

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
by sir julian king

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,880
who was proved to be

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,359
the last british commissioner in

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
brussels

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
but at the same time sir julian was

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
the first one to bring together

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,160
all elements of european union security

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,960
policies

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
under the single roof of a security

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,200
union

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,879
of a security ecosystem if you like

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,920
which is now the basis on which the new

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,480
team

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
will be building for the next five years

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,079
president

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
uh thunderlion has maintained

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
and reinforced this structure

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,560
and gave me the opportunity

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
to work on security policies in a

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,159
holistic

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
and modern way dear friends

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,600
every person in the european union has

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,320
the right

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,479
to feel safe safe in their streets

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,560
and their homes every operator too

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
in the market should be in a position to

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,840
protect

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
their businesses from cyber attacks

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
and society at large should be in a

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,479
position

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
to reap the benefits of technology

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,000
minimizing

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
the risks attached to it it is not a

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,079
secret

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,119
that we're living in an age with

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,000
increasingly complex cross-border and

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
cross-sectorial security threats

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,799
emerging

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
every day highlighting the need for

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,119
closer cooperation on security

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,840
at all levels in this very complex

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,239
ecosystem europe is

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
and should remain an anchor of stability

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
in a world that is becoming increasingly

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,319
more unstable and unpredictable

54
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,319
as the chairman just said as vice

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
president of the european commission

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
my new role will be to ensure that all

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
the elements of a europe

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
that protects and the europe that

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,560
empowers work seamlessly

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,680
together a europe that delivers

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
on its promise to protect our internal

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
market

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,560
with a genuine security union which is a

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,519
shield

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,080
but also with a set of policies for

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,040
mobility

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
investment and technological progress

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,160
which is

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,239
an asset there has been

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,760
significant progress in the last years

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,840
and now in the years to come we will

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
intensify our efforts

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,159
but the reality is that europe's

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,080
approach to security

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
remains fragmented and it remains

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
fragmented

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,519
across a host of different policy areas

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,800
and remains fragmented

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
across certain levels of policy making

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,519
digital growth and rapid technological

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,159
development

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,400
create enormous opportunities challenges

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,159
but also threats

84
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,040
and we have been discussing that before

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
it is not a secret

86
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
that the technological time

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
and the time of science is

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,319
as a general rule much faster than

89
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,799
the political time the time of politics

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
cyber attacks are one of the top 10

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
global risks

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
for the next decade according to the wef

93
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
global risks report for this year

94
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,519
but at the same time this globality of

95
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
threat shows

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
makes it very clear that no country is

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,879
capable

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,239
of tackling this challenge alone

99
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,159
enhanced cooperation between our member

100
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
states and more coordinated

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
investments in the field of cyber

102
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,040
security are of paramount importance to

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,079
address this very

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
complex issue and to continue building

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
eu's resilience against cyber attacks

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,479
we will be working in the years to come

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,880
to establish these kinds of synergies

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
between all kinds of stakeholders member

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,800
states

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
the private sector civil society and

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
academia

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
and what we're doing here today you know

113
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
i think it's very promising

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
start in the last five years

115
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
when it comes to protecting our economy

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
and society from

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
cyber security risks they you had made

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
broke head make progress we have not

119
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
only witnessed the adoption

120
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,360
of the first pieces of eu legislation

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
on cyber security but we have also

122
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
brought cooperation between member

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,800
states

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
in this field to an entirely new level

125
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
i must also say at this time

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,440
that in this work we

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,360
in europe and in brussels in particular

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
we very often feel rather

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
alone in this battle unfortunately

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,479
it is becoming increasingly clear that

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,680
not all regions in the world

132
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
share the vision of an open free

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,199
fair stable and secure cyberspace

134
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
where fundamental freedoms and values as

135
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
we know them in europe

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,919
are respected more and more

137
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,880
state actors are more willing to employ

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
cyber tools

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,759
to achieve geopolitical goals

140
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,360
and we as a european union will have to

141
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,160
adapt

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,479
to the geopolitical realities and the

143
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,440
evolving threat

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
landscape by developing new and adequate

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,919
responses

146
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,840
to these threats and by making the most

147
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
not of only of our values but of

148
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
existing legal framework to protect our

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,758
values

150
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
as far as i am concerned in this field

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,759
the era of innocence some say

152
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,240
naivete is over in europe

153
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
we have already seen the benefits of

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
coordinating our efforts

155
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
both in identifying risks but

156
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
also in identifying solutions action

157
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,800
and i'll have a chance to say a few

158
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,560
words on our work on

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,440
5g networks in a few moments so we will

160
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
continue focusing on improving

161
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
cooperation and information

162
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,639
sharing amongst our member states in all

163
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
these areas

164
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
and we need to switch from a need to

165
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,639
know

166
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
to a need to share attitude

167
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
amongst the member states of the union

168
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,960
and this

169
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
will be the role of the joint cyber unit

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,240
an emblematic initiative announced by

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,759
president thunderlion

172
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
this summer in her political guidelines

173
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
we have also already announced that this

174
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,199
year will review

175
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,520
the existing directive on security of

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
networks and information systems

177
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,960
also known as nis directive

178
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,240
which was the first cyber security law

179
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,960
in the european union the first attempt

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,199
to create a culture of protection of

181
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
critical infrastructures including

182
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
energy

183
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
banking healthcare but also digital

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,599
services providers

185
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
we're doing this through a culture of

186
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
reporting of incidents

187
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,080
so that we can learn more from each

188
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,039
other

189
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,479
and understand our vulnerabilities

190
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,319
but also from a culture of

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,080
responsibility

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,639
so that states and private actors

193
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,919
share and identify

194
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,639
what approaches we need to apply and

195
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
where we can do more

196
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,759
to maximize opportunities and minimize

197
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,039
threats this work is vital

198
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,400
because it's about protecting our market

199
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
a market which is connected and

200
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,240
interdependent

201
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
and where you anyone is

202
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,440
always as strong as its weakest link

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,559
this work of updating our niche rules

204
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,800
will be undertaken in parallel with

205
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
another revision

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
of what we call european critical

207
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
infrastructure directive

208
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
because there the aim would be also to

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
update very old

210
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,480
rules on cross-sectoral legislation on

211
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
physical infrastructure of critical

212
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
importance

213
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
this is a moment where europe would need

214
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
to align fully the protection

215
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
of our digital and physical critical

216
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
infrastructures there can be

217
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
no asymmetry in the way we protect our

218
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
citizens

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,399
and together with our agency for cyber

220
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
security and isa

221
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
we will continue to proceed to

222
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
implementing a certification network we

223
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
adopted last year

224
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,560
this agency allow us to avoid

225
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,959
fragmentation of regulation at eu level

226
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,200
and promote the cyber security culture

227
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
in europe

228
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
and with our partners around the globe

229
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,440
we have also proposed to set up

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
and i hope that this will be done as

231
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
soon as possible in the new

232
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
commission mandate to set up a european

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
cyber security

234
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,440
industrial technology and research

235
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
competence

236
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
center this new competence center

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
will help strengthen european cyber

238
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
security capacities

239
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
shielding our economy and society from

240
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,279
attacks

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
maintaining research excellence and

242
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,480
society

243
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
and and competitiveness of our eu

244
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,600
industry

245
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
and this effort is something that is now

246
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,839
relatively

247
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,640
urgent finally

248
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
tomorrow no next week i'm confused with

249
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
continuous traveling next week next

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,519
wednesday

251
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
the commission will launch a major

252
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,360
consultation

253
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,200
on artificial intelligence a technology

254
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
that can be used against but also for

255
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
security

256
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
it can provide tools for detecting

257
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,720
attacks

258
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
but it can also be used by malicious

259
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,760
actors

260
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,839
to multiply them in our societies

261
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,720
other our families and friends in the

262
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
years to come

263
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
we have to live with a new friend or

264
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
rather a frenemy

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
which would be called algorithms

266
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
and the way we go about algorithms that

267
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
will shape

268
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
a new reality will have to be framed

269
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
now and this frame

270
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
has to be done at the european level

271
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
because this is precisely what europe

272
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,399
knows how to do well we may not have

273
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
air carriers or fighter jets but we can

274
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,480
still

275
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
frame policy development at the

276
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,200
at a common base to facilitate society

277
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,519
and

278
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
economy on 5g

279
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
we will also continue to play a key role

280
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
in the way these technologies will be

281
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
developed

282
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
we need to ensure that 5g networks are

283
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
secure

284
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,560
and resilient against increasing cyber

285
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
attacks and incidents and this is

286
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
particularly true for infrastructure

287
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,680
such as

288
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,279
energy transport financial and health

289
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
you will certainly know that together

290
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
with our member states we have worked to

291
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,279
produce

292
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,519
and presented ten days ago a toolbox

293
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,320
a toolbox for mitigating measures and

294
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,959
plans

295
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
designed to address effectively all

296
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
major risks associated to 5g networks

297
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,120
such as criminal hacking espionage and

298
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
sabotage

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,360
in a coordinated and european way

300
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
by 2030 5g technology

301
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,600
will allow will promote

302
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,000
the emergence of 500 billion

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,560
interconnected devices in europe

304
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
practically everything will be connected

305
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
to everything

306
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
and everything will be connected to

307
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,480
everyone

308
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,120
this new reality is almost here

309
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,079
so the way we go about risks and

310
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,040
opportunities

311
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,920
associated to this new world is for us

312
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,720
to do

313
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,399
and is for us to do now

314
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,079
let me now turn to cyber crime

315
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
we also need to step up our efforts if

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
we want to make sure that our

317
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,480
authorities

318
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
can keep up with a high level of

319
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
adaptability and flexibility

320
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
employed by those who attack us

321
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
we tackle cyber security aspects not

322
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
only in civilian but also in defense the

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,360
defense domain

324
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
and we have our law enforcement agencies

325
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
like europol doing very effective work

326
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
in this area

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
cyber defense is also an important

328
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,320
aspect

329
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,920
of our defense capabilities and as such

330
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,279
it is part of our work program both

331
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,079
as the commission but also in view of

332
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,760
the creation of the new

333
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
european defense fund which we have

334
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,680
proposed

335
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,959
and which we have proposed to

336
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,800
provide with an important financial

337
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,000
level of 13 billion

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
euros for the next seven years so that

339
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,079
we can concentrate

340
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,160
simplify and rationalize the very often

341
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,279
uh inexplicably expensive research

342
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
that we pay across europe on arms

343
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,880
and equipment cyber security

344
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199
is also critical critical on our work on

345
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,720
hybrid threats

346
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
the commission recently worked on the

347
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
security of our elections

348
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
and helped our eu member states to learn

349
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
how to make their national systems more

350
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,600
resistant more resilient and we had the

351
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
first success

352
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
because thanks to this work for the

353
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,480
first time

354
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,399
the european elections last summer were

355
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,199
which is by the way the second biggest

356
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
electoral process

357
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,839
on the planet after the indian elections

358
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,959
for the first time

359
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
the european elections were protected

360
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,079
from this information misinformation

361
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
and hybrid threats we need to continue

362
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,320
working in this area

363
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
with cooperation investments investments

364
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,120
in equipment in infrastructure but

365
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,160
also investments in the necessary

366
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,519
skills and knowledge

367
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
the quest for more skills in europe that

368
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,959
match the needs in this area

369
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,680
is a fundamental component for building

370
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
our strength

371
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
europe in the years to come will need

372
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
a skills revolution in the digital

373
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,120
economy

374
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
a major wave of investments national

375
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
european and the major wave of

376
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,959
investments and incentives to attract

377
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
the people we need

378
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
and the people that we currently do not

379
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,639
have

380
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,800
unless we succeed in this skills

381
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
revolution

382
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,519
we will not be able to make it not in

383
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
security union but also

384
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,720
on technology development

385
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
and finally have left for the end

386
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,240
something that is probably the

387
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,519
most precious commodity in the area of

388
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
security and goes beyond infrastructure

389
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
competence

390
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
skills people networks

391
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,560
and this is trust

392
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,920
we need trust to build a true

393
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
security union in europe trust

394
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,120
amongst ourselves trust amongst member

395
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
states

396
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
trust amongst member states at brussels

397
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
trusts among industry civil society and

398
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
policy making

399
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
as far as we are concerned and i had the

400
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,240
chance to explain

401
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,279
this to to many of my institutional

402
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
interlocutors some of them present here

403
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,759
as far as we are concerned

404
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
our work on this security union

405
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,959
work stream will never be a work

406
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,079
that will aim to duplicate or

407
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,199
replace work that is done

408
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,559
effectively at national level we will

409
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,319
not do that

410
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,000
but we will do everything we can to make

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,119
our member states our agencies

412
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,319
industry and civil society see

413
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,520
that we are here to multiply we're here

414
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,160
to provide

415
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
added value and we're here to activate

416
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,679
networks

417
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,400
and the communality of you which is

418
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,360
crucial

419
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,679
at this moment so

420
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
what we are doing here today and what is

421
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
about to follow because i saw the

422
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
program and i'm

423
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,039
particularly impressed by the richness

424
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,240
and the diversity

425
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
of the different angles with which

426
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,320
you will discussing cybersecurity today

427
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,039
so

428
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,400
this is an excellent start actually

429
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,559
i think this is the best ever possible

430
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
start i would have in my new job

431
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,200
in charge of security union it is a

432
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,679
fantastic opportunity for us not only to

433
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,440
share with you our thoughts

434
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,799
but also to listen and to learn

435
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
so i wish you all a fruitful afternoon

436
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,320
and i invite you to stay close to us

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
work with us

438
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
and stack then cyber security with us

439
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
many thanks
