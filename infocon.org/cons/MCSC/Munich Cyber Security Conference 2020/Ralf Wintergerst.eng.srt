1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,960
good afternoon and a very warm welcome

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,240
to the fixed

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
munich cyber security conference

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
i greatly appreciate you're here today

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,639
the weather is so nice outside that you

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,000
could have done something different

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,880
i was hoping for bad weather but

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
typically during this conference we have

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,680
very nice weather

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,359
it has a downside because after two

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
hours we run out of oxygen

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
um but at the same time i must say we

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,199
always choose this location here

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
the buyer shohoff because tomorrow our

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,760
big brother the security conference

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,040
starts here

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
and we always feel we should stay close

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,879
to that

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
and we should make it a routine to have

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
the cyber security conference

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,879
before because it's very important

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,600
and it takes more and more space also in

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
the main conference

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
for good reason but let me not just

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,440
welcome all of you

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,239
but let me also welcome a very special

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,840
guest here

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
mr sheena's the vice president of the eu

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
commission

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
in charge of security and i'm not sure

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
whether they looked up the homepage of

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,560
the commission

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
very recently what you will find

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
is a very well and nicely described

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,360
vision of each commissioner

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
and all the duties

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,720
and responsibilities are described very

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,840
well

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,360
and when you read mr sheena's

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,720
vision and idea is promoting

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
our european way of life that includes

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,119
a security union and probably we're

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:41,759
going to hear

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
something after the after i speak from

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,240
you

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
so it's a great honor to have you here

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,200
thank you very much for coming

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,799
we also expect another guest to have a

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,240
little bit flight problems

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
uh mr jose angel guria the

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
secretary general of the oecd he will

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,799
come sometime

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,840
soon and he will speak later as well and

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
it's also a great pleasure to have the

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,480
oecd here because the ocd

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
is aiming for better policies for better

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
life

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
and i think nowadays it's not just the

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,879
sound objective

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
i think it's needed to make our life

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,080
better because the digital society

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
offers a lot of opportunities but it

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
also requires that we have the right

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,280
policies

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
behind and last but not least

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,599
i would like to welcome mr yeshuhida

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
nakayama

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,879
state secretary of the foreign ministry

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,640
of japan thank you very much for

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,839
for coming

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
so in that sense i would like to also

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,120
welcome you as

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
dear fellow colleagues dear fellow

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,159
colleagues

75
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,080
i'm speaking to all of you now

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
independent of hierarchy independent

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,879
from where you are

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
because we all have one and the same

79
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
object objective

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
that is to make this world a little bit

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
a better place

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
in particular with all the changes we

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
actually foresee

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
often driven through technology and

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
often driven through political change

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
that is the thing we have in common here

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,959
that's the reason why we are here that's

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,640
the reason why we want to have debates

89
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
that's the reason i want to hear

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,120
opinions new issues old issues but also

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,959
proposals on what we can do

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
in actually to pro promote that

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
objective

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
for that we also need to have capable

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
moderators they sit in front of me here

96
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,040

so before we move on with the main part

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
let me quickly set the scene

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,880
for this conference here today we choose

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
the title

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
fail safe act brave building

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,199
a secure and brazilian digital society

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,320
for thousands of years

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,199
tangible things

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,440
assets have been the driving force

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,520
in our societies and that actually

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
drove the societies which were living in

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,199
protected by walls by borders

132
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,680
physically and the digital world really

133
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
has changed that

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,639
the technical innovation we saw over the

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,960
last three decades

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
created something which is virtual

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,359
values not just physical values

138
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
and these virtual values are not really

139
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
tangible

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
but we all go with the digital

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
infrastructures and with our digital

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,320
identities

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
into this world and that world

144
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
has not the same protection as the

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
physical world

146
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
it has a different kind of protection

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,479
and the vulnerabilities in this world

148
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,600
changes very fast

149
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
and as it changes very fast we have to

150
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
think hey what are the root causes

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
why it changes fast and b what we can do

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
that's what we hope for to find

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,520
input here today let me outline a few

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,479
reasons why i believe

155
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,720
it will accelerate even faster if you

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
look at the last decade from 2010 to

157
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
2020

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,520
we saw a lot of changes i think

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
the time will never be as slow

160
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,319
as it has been the decade to 2030 will

161
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,240
even accelerate

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,039
just look at the global spend for

163
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
innovation

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
it is over 2 000 billion

165
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,039
2 trillion spent in innovation in r d

166
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,440
580 billion dollars come from the united

167
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,039
states

168
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,440
in the meantime 520 from china

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,560
followed by japan 180.

170
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
germany is the only country from the eu

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
under the top five with run

172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
round about 120. so

173
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,199
having united states with 580 having

174
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
china with 520

175
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
europe altogether 400

176
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,039
actually it makes good reason that

177
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
europe cooperates

178
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
it makes good reason that europe

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
cooperates

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,360
and the technological race is on because

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
it's not just the race on having the

182
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,319
best technology

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,720
but it's also a race on who is having

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
the best technology

185
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,639
that makes it a bit complicated yeah

186
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,720
so if that span goes on and it increases

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
year by year that is one of the root

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,639
causes why it gets faster

189
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,759
a second point to look at is of how

190
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,199
policies are being made today

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,960
and what we see is that policy making

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
mr sheen as we just spoke about it very

193
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
briefly

194
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
of course can often only react it's very

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
difficult to be proactive in policy

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,759
making

197
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
but if the world is technology fueled

198
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,240
if it is not undermined with

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
technological competence

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
and input how can we be confident

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
that we see the consequences and the

202
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
benefit of certain technologies as we

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,599
move ahead

204
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
so we must enrich policy making with

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
technological

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,440
input i think otherwise we maybe fail

207
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,039
and if you think that a bit further down

208
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
the line

209
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,599
then we still are the same people

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,759
like 30 years back we still live in the

211
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
same governments we still live in the

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,840
same

213
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,159
infrastructures the rules are often

214
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
still the same

215
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,919
so how can we make sure that we actually

216
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
catch up with today's world

217
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
and that we make the policies which are

218
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,519
technology

219
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,080
in the technology driven world so that

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,720
it fits

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
to today's society so that we can fill

222
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
the objective we have built a secure and

223
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,959
resilient

224
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
digital world i would hope to see a lot

225
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
of input here today

226
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,839
because that's what we're here for i

227
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,000
think the audience is perfect for that i

228
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
like the small setup with content-rich

229
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
discussions

230
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
not the big shows here we have

231
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
content-rich discussions

232
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
so that we all contribute here today to

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
a better

234
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
resilient and secure digital world

235
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,120
i wish you all a good conference here

236
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
today

237
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,600
and i wish you good input and now i

238
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
would like to ask

239
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
our special guest of honor mr sheena's

240
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
to take the floor thank you very much

241
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,519
