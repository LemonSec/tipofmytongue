[Music]

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,660
let me Jump Right In a theme of the

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,199
conference has been essentially wither

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,359
the rules-based order

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,480
who who's in charge how do we solve the

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,560
Cyber problem and there's been a lot of

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,640
pessimism about the role of treaties the

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,180
speed with which policy is developing in

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,940
an uncertain world where the rules-based

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,379
order is under challenge as one of the

12
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,360
foremost thinkers in the United States

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,899
about Homeland Security having served as

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,739
the the president's top advisor on Cyber

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,420
along with other issues and in your

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,899
current role overseeing the FBI the

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,699
justice department and prosecutors how

18
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,500
do you think about it well thanks so

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,300
much John and uh thanks so much for

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,700
having me here at the cyber security

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,000
Forum here in Munich look I think all of

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
the work that we are doing and that

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,500
conferences like this Advance when it

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,380
comes to uh policy issues and

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,780
multilateral approaches is absolutely

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,180
vital but I also think that we can't

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,700
wait we can't wait uh for that process

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,520
to move in advance before we uh

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,340
certainly at the justice department from

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,659
a law enforcement and National Security

31
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,060
perspective before we act which is why

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,159
when I came into this job nearly two

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,180
years ago I took a kind of wholesale

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,280
look at what we were doing in the

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,500
Justice Department conducted a

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,479
comprehensive cyber review which you

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,820
know John because you led that review

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,520
and what I determined was we were at a

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,860
pivot point and we needed to change our

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,020
orientation and we did that and we have

41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,939
been doing that and we've been acting on

42
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,579
it for the last two years and what we

43
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,680
have done is change our orientation to

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
one where we're putting prevention first

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,179
disruption first and we are putting

46
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,120
victims at the center of our approach so

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,340
what do I mean by that I mean we are now

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,560
on our front foot and taking action

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,980
using an all tools approach a page we

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,959
have taken from the book that we use to

51
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,300
as all of you know except because since

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,879
it has required multilateral and

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,700
international Partnerships uh to beat

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,620
back the terrorism threat and to address

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,840
the terrorism threat and we're taking a

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,640
similar all tools approach to the Cyber

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,700
threat so that means we are trying to

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,379
break the business model when it comes

59
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,120
to ransomware actors and you see that in

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,879
the work we did in clawing back

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,980
ransomware payments in the call in the

62
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,519
colonial pipeline attack you see that in

63
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,560
the work that we did with very

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,319
importantly International Partners to

65
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,780
hack the hackers when we took down the

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,420
hive ransomware Network just a few weeks

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,040
ago and Laden wait in the network swiped

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,620
decrypter keys and gave them back to the

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,480
victims so they could protect themselves

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,940
and we are still doing the old-fashioned

71
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,220
work of and very important work of

72
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,180
working with our partners to arrest Bad

73
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,159
actors and you see that in the work that

74
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,760
we've done to arrest the soda nikibi

75
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,379
actors key actors when it comes to

76
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,300
trickbot and lock button I could go on

77
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,400
and on but the point here is we're on

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,680
our front foot and not waiting to take

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,420
action but importantly putting victims

80
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,500
at the center

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,080
and in order to do that uh Innovative

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,239
approach of putting victims at the

83
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,519
center you need information you need

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,140
intelligence and you need information

85
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,840
intelligence as the foremost law

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,959
enforcement action that you can lawfully

87
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,360
act on how do you balance that against

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
some of the restrictions on sharing

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,099
information that are done with good

90
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,519
intentions in the name of privacy what

91
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,000
type of new statutes actions policies do

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,959
you need to keep getting that

93
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,420
information so you've hit upon it John

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,299
it is vitally important our ability to

95
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,120
rapidly share information with our

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,220
partners consistent with legal

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,978
Frameworks and protections that apply

98
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,418
but I'm glad you raised this and

99
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,760
obviously this uh this audience knows

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,979
all too well the very complicated

101
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,720
environment we all find ourselves in

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,699
when it comes to information sharing on

103
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,680
this and a host of other issues and so

104
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,600
what we're doing is trying to put in

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,780
place new mechanisms that continue to

106
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,240
have lead legal controls in a framework

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,400
that we can all operate under as a as a

108
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,900
global set of leaders and people coming

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,820
in good faith to address these issues

110
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,919
and I'll take a case in point

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,180
um many of you know I'm sure are

112
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,340
familiar with the cloud act that passed

113
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,620
a few years ago in the United States we

114
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,020
in the United States have entered into a

115
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,479
data access sharing agreement with the

116
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,419
UK under the cloud act but this is

117
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,639
complicated because what we're seeing is

118
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,699
it's being misrepresented and

119
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,500
misperceived and I think there's a lot

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,139
of misperceptions about what it is and

121
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,960
what it isn't out there and so I want to

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,000
take the opportunity to clear some of

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,380
that up because it's a very important

124
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,320
audience to do so first there is a

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,539
misperception that the cloud act and

126
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,039
this agreement that we entered into with

127
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,860
the UK and that we hope to do a similar

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,620
agreement with other countries in the EU

129
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,780
there's a misperception that it gives

130
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,060
the United States States some new

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,720
Authority it does not it makes explicit

132
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,440
A widely accepted principle that a

133
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,820
nation can provide legal process to a

134
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,880
provider if that provider comes within

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,699
that nation's jurisdiction to compel

136
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,460
production of information again under

137
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,280
legal process no matter where that

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
information is held and I say this is a

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,020
widely accepted principle because it is

140
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,880
enshrined in the Budapest convention

141
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,639
that has been in in effect for over 20

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,919
years I believe and is signed up to to I

143
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,120
think 26 of 27 EU member states and I

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,740
say it's a widely accepted principle

145
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,360
because it will be enshrined in the

146
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,699
forthcoming e-evidence regulation that

147
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,880
the EU is promulgating so I think it's

148
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,460
exceptionally important that we be very

149
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,319
clear about the framework we're

150
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,319
operating Under And also the the final

151
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,660
point on this is this type of

152
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,220
arrangement this type type of agreement

153
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,220
is fundamental to our cooperation and I

154
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,259
would argue it is fundamental to cyber

155
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,479
security it's incredibly important that

156
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,780
people understand that the agreement and

157
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,880
the access to data comes with important

158
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,400
safeguards and in our system that means

159
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,460
a warrant issued by an independent judge

160
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,940
based on a finding of probable cause and

161
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,400
based on a very particular showing by

162
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,199
prosecutors in a criminal investigation

163
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,300
so it's incredibly important that we be

164
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,220
clear about the safeguards and the

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,960
framework that we operate under

166
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,460
so we've talked a little bit about the

167
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,380
the legal framework and then how you use

168
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,419
that framework to get information to do

169
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,120
things like hack the hackers steal back

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,680
keys so people can get access to

171
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,580
information return money to victims but

172
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,400
I know you've just spoke and made a

173
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,000
major announcement in uh in London at

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,300
Chatham House I think yesterday and

175
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,380
ironically no Chatham house rules at

176
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,840
Chatham House yes

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
to get a lot of a lot of press despite

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,259
the chatter Mouse rule uh the uh and you

179
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,419
talked there about using a lot of tools

180
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,940
in this space that aren't cyber enabled

181
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,400
using the information to use other types

182
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,840
of tools could you tell us a little bit

183
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,400
about that framework and how it relates

184
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,460
to cyber security sure and you know this

185
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,460
forum is a perfect place to discuss this

186
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,039
because what I talked about in London is

187
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,139
something we are all confronting which

188
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,220
is a era of great power competition

189
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,580
which of course describes a post-cold

190
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,479
war reality but it also describes an era

191
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,180
where autocratic governments are

192
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,259
acquiring using and abusing disruptive

193
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,699
Technologies and by that I mean

194
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,919
technologies that are accelerating

195
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,819
critical advances that give a

196
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,520
nation-state who's using them a military

197
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
and National Security Edge and what

198
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,779
we're seeing is autocratic gov

199
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,399
governments trying to acquire these

200
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,360
Technologies and accelerate their

201
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,099
development of them by any means

202
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,399
necessary listen and elicit and so what

203
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,820
I announced was a task force-led Strike

204
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,680
Force called the digital

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,240
um uh sorry the disruptive technology

206
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Strike Force led by the justice

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,240
department and our Commerce Department

208
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,200
to pool our expertise and go after those

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,260
who are trying to acquire and abuse this

210
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,959
technology in violation of our export

211
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,760
control regimes and I think it's

212
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,500
critically important that we are using

213
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,080
these tools that we are doing so in

214
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,300
collaboration both in the United States

215
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,279
and with our International partners

216
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,800
because these Technologies are being

217
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,500
used by autocratic governments to

218
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,860
project power at home and abroad

219
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,820
certainly to make these National

220
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,580
Security advances but also to repress

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,120
dissent and engage in transnational

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,980
repression around the world and we're

223
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,260
seeing it far too often

224
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,240
if followed up you talk about autocratic

225
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,019
uh regimes I want to talk about one in

226
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,519
particular when it comes to technology

227
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,519
and restrictions on technology and

228
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
that's China and there's been a lot of

229
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,839
discussion here about what does it mean

230
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,779
to shape Behavior or use tools like

231
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,200
export control when the goal is not

232
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,220
decoupling but shaping behavior and also

233
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
for our German colleagues in particular

234
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,040
but EU how is this approach being done

235
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,220
multilaterally versus unilaterally you

236
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,560
uh you talked about your own personal uh

237
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,779
non-use of tick tock at the conference

238
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,839
for some reason that got a lot of news

239
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,399
who knows but tell us a little bit about

240
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,380
how this approach applies to China and

241
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,300
what's the perspective on the U.S on

242
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,160
working with with colleagues across the

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,180
Atlantic

244
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,940
it is vitally important there's not a

245
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,940
single thing that we do uh certainly in

246
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,420
the Cyber realm and in the types of uh

247
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,920
issues that I just described when it

248
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,940
comes to export controls sanctions uh in

249
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,540
sanctions Invasion uh enforcement all of

250
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,300
this takes uh critical work with our

251
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,260
partners every single uh notable cyber

252
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,500
disruption whether it's ransomware

253
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,579
networks that we've taken down whether

254
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,600
it's uh disruption of a GRU botnet as we

255
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,579
did with the operation Cyclops blink

256
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,339
last year all of these things the Hydra

257
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,380
darknet Marketplace that we took down

258
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,240
thank you very much with the help of our

259
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,880
German colleagues everything we are

260
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,040
doing in this space has an international

261
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,579
aspect we cannot operate in a single

262
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,579
Silo none of us can do any of this alone

263
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,300
so International cooperation is a

264
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,940
critical piece of everything we do you

265
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,160
know we say in the United States in

266
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,019
typical fashion using a sports metaphor

267
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,019
that cyber is a team sport well

268
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,720
sometimes the best athlete may be one of

269
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,760
our foreign partners and our goal has

270
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,920
got to be to use whatever the best tool

271
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
is to disrupt the attack to prevent the

272
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,680
harm from happening and to put whatever

273
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,220
the best athlete can be on the field and

274
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,019
sometimes that will be our foreign

275
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,120
partner and as teammates we need to

276
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,519
enable our partners just as we would

277
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,980
hope they would enable us so the

278
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,100
international cooperation is vital and I

279
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,680
don't see that stopping anytime soon

280
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,060
you talked about International

281
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,579
cooperation another theme of the

282
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,160
conference has been cooperation with the

283
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,760
private sector in the uh approach where

284
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,519
sometimes the the private sector is

285
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
viewed as the villain here and is uh

286
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
subject to Regulatory and other actions

287
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,240
saying you need to be more secure and

288
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,980
it's your fault and then others have

289
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,279
talked about them as uh as a victim and

290
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,839
said come in and we're we're here to

291
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,579
help and to use your team partner with

292
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,980
partner with you against the bad guy

293
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,920
what's your message to the private

294
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
sector

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,700
my message is we are all in this

296
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,579
together and the sooner we all recognize

297
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,420
that we in government and those uh of us

298
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,000
who partner with those in the private

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,279
sector uh the sooner we recognize that

300
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,740
the better off we'll be I've talked

301
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,480
about a number of the steps that we've

302
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,180
taken to address malicious cyber actors

303
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,180
the critical element uh to every single

304
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,220
one of these is also victim reporting

305
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,200
take the High

306
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
um uh take down uh just a few weeks ago

307
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,120
it was critically important to have

308
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,200
victim reporting there to enable us to

309
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,880
lie in wait quite frankly I described it

310
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,060
as a 21st century cyber Stakeout through

311
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,639
incredibly good work by the FBI and our

312
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,620
partners we literally were sitting

313
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,740
inside the network

314
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,920
and swiping to crypter keys and passing

315
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,620
them on to the victims before they could

316
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,300
feel the effect of the ransomware attack

317
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,800
so that was vital we did that for months

318
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,959
but as as good as it was and as

319
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,180
important as the impact that we had

320
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,880
which was to prevent over a 130 million

321
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,820
dollars in ransomware payments it was a

322
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,279
result of only 20 percent of the victims

323
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,680
reporting imagine the impact we could

324
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,440
have had if we had had a much higher

325
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,660
number so my messages were in This

326
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,120
Together the victim reporting is

327
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,360
critically important it certainly helps

328
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,180
law enforcement but I would argue it

329
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,519
also is good for business it is good for

330
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,560
the bottom line because it can prevent

331
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,779
you it can certainly lessen your loss as

332
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,540
Colonial found but it also can prevent

333
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,600
you from being the victim and also help

334
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,899
you prevent the next victim let me uh

335
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,240
open it up to questions from the

336
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,579
audience the in the role in the United

337
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,440
States at the justice department they

338
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,019
enforce

339
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,399
Behavior to prevent age discrimination

340
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,160
so unlike our esteemed prime minister

341
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,199
colleague any age is welcome to ask a

342
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,040
question although I had

343
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,880
guys hi thank you so much I'm my name is

344
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
Dr Jennifer Cassidy I'm with the

345
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,720
University of Oxford

346
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,699
and alongside

347
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,740
um increased information sharing with

348
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,779
your partners

349
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,820
um within the judicial null framework

350
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,920
would you agree that one of the greatest

351
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,720
challenges and something I think about

352
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,320
regularly of our time is the speed and

353
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
acceleration of the new disruptive

354
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,839
Technologies versus the length of time

355
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
that nation states and Regional blocks

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,959
have the ability to legislate for these

357
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,240
new disruptive Technologies and how to

358
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
balance that so I'd just be wondering

359
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,180
your thoughts on that and thank you very

360
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,459
much thank you for the um really

361
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,680
insightful question I I think you've Hit

362
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,860
Upon a huge challenge

363
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,260
um the the norms and the Frameworks that

364
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,860
we are all struggling uh to build as we

365
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,339
are flying the airplane of also trying

366
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,260
to ensure that we're developing these

367
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,560
Technologies to be put

368
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,079
to greater good use everything from

369
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,660
semiconductor chips to Quantum compute

370
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,899
shooting to AI but I think what is very

371
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,360
much at the Forefront even as we try and

372
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,699
run both races simultaneously we have to

373
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,720
recognize that China for instance is

374
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,420
doing that as well but from a standpoint

375
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,760
where they are trying to mold the use

376
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,620
and the Norms around these technologies

377
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,079
that privileges their view of the world

378
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,300
that privileges their values those

379
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,060
values are completely antithetical to

380
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,779
our own there those values are about

381
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,339
authoritarianism ours are about

382
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,680
democracy and alliances which this

383
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,220
conference so wonderfully showcases and

384
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,259
just to follow up on that because it's

385
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,600
where you started uh your remarks today

386
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,759
the question was really what do you do

387
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,639
when disruptive technology speeds past

388
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,880
the rate at which laws laws change and

389
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,699
you're known for being action oriented

390
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,940
how do you how do you use tools in that

391
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,940
framework uh in innovative ways with

392
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,899
partners well um we've got to be putting

393
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,939
them to use developing them in concert

394
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,859
developing the Norms around them in

395
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,380
concert but always mindful of our shared

396
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,900
values and doing so within a rule of law

397
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,359
framework because if we lose that I

398
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,179
think we have lost our ballast and we

399
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,280
can't uh we can't be dissuaded from that

400
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,900
and final question

401
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,640
thank you so much Alexander Martin from

402
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,959
the record again I'm sorry to everyone

403
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,579
for having to put up with the journalist

404
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,319
grabbing the microphone and the

405
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,520
Department of Justice has had a couple

406
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,419
of

407
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,520
um quite notable activities against

408
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,160
ransomware actors over the past few

409
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,140
weeks and months

410
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,820
um which of these do you think is going

411
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,620
to be the most successful the sanctions

412
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,200
against the trickbot group

413
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,960
or the kind of hacking the hackers as it

414
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,000
was against Hive and which should we

415
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,980
expect more of going forward

416
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,120
all of the above

417
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,100
so please uh join me in thanking uh Lisa

418
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,780
Monaco Deputy attorney general for

419
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,850
joining us today thanks very much

420
