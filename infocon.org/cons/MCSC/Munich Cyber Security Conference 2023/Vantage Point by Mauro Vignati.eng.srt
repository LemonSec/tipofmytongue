[Music]

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,139
thank you

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,760
so thank you for inviting the

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,199
international Committee of the Red Cross

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,039
here at this event so why is the ICC

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
here today

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,599
it's because the digitalization Warfare

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,540
in an established fact and it poses new

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,820
risks to civilians

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,700
so just as entire societies

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,739
are being transformed by processes of

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,480
digitalization so to our Armed Forces

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,600
their capabilities and operations and

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,820
this has important consequences for

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,340
critical civilian infrastructure and for

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,500
entire populations

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,680
but what we are exactly witnessing that

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,500
is of particular concern

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,140
so of the past years analysts have

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,960
repeatedly raised concern about cyber

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,340
operations against civilian

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,100
infrastructure power plants

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,860
medical facilities civilian e-governance

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,860
systems private companies

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
these operations continue to be of

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,479
utmost concern in most cases they

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,840
unlawfully target civilians

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,479
so we have served other warring Trends

30
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,360
and today I want to bring you six issues

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,720
to your attention so the first one

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,299
is the involvement of civilians in

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,479
military cyber and digital activities

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,240
so in other words the civilianization of

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,759
military cyber and other digital

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,400
activities for instance

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,340
by providing to civilians digital tools

38
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,340
to collect actionable intelligence

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,740
or by providing civilians offensive

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,100
cyber tools these digital forms of

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,939
involvement have a much lower threshold

42
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,560
anyone with a smartphone

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
can join the cyber warfare

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,479
and digitalization has also transformed

45
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,060
the concept of remoteness while

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,760
individuals may be physically remote

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,000
from the theater or facilities there are

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,860
only one click away from the digital

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,599
Battlefield

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,120
and digitalization has also made it much

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,160
easier to scale up any civilian

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
involvement a group of comprising of

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,319
thousands or hundreds of thousands of

54
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,780
individuals may be formed and

55
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,360
coordinated in a matter of hours

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,700
so International humanitarian law

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,459
prescribed at parties to Armed conflicts

58
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,099
must at all times distinguish between

59
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,500
competence who conduct there's still

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,060
this on behalf to parties to the

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,080
conflict

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,319
and civilians who are presumed to

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,019
refrain from doing so a must therefore

64
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,560
be protected against the dangers arising

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
from the conflict so under International

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,060
military law

67
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,040
civilians are protected against attack

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
unless and for such time as they

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
directly participate in hostilities

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
therefore encouraging civilian

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
participation in cyber activities during

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,080
armed conflict could undermine the

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,239
protection of civilians

74
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,700
who must be spared from the effect of

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,319
armed conflict

76
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,440
that's why icrc strongly recommends the

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,440
states to reverse the trend of

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
civilianization of the digital

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,220
Battlefield

80
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,980
the second worrisome trend are

81
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,980
operations and attacks against dual use

82
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,319
digital Technologies

83
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,540
from the sabotage of fiber optic

84
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,340
undersea cables

85
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,340
what is called the seabed Warfare

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,680
to the destruction of Civilian satellite

87
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
links

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,879
do I use digital technologies that is

89
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
service Services used by both military

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,599
and civilians are constantly attacked

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,640
and here we find again the renew

92
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,879
pressure on the principle of Distinction

93
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,739
if the principle applies to the

94
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,720
distinction between civilians and

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,680
Military

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
International military law or the forces

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
the distinction between military

98
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,478
objectives and civilian objects

99
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,139
only the entire infrastructure that

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,419
makes up the internet was not designed

101
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,600
with the aim of distinguishing these two

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,860
dimensions

103
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,020
which have a symbiotic relationship in

104
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,580
the digital

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,820
this means that the more the military is

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,360
relying on cable satellites and clouds

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,540
that are otherwise civilian the more

108
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,880
likely it becomes that this kind of

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,759
infrastructure will be targeted with

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,040
significant adverse consequences on

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
civilians

112
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,660
one way to prevent this is to separate

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,240
digital infrastructures that are used by

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,259
military

115
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,900
from those used by civilians

116
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
technically the separation is feasible

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,180
but is the political will that must be

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,699
pushed in this direction

119
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,280
the third trend is the fact that digital

120
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
Technologies are changing the geography

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,419
of conflicts

122
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,639
cooperation between private technology

123
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,820
sector and Armed Forces as an important

124
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,100
impact in this respect

125
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,580
think of the Austin of military assets

126
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,919
on civilian Cloud instances

127
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,620
that are located outside the countries

128
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,539
involved in conflict

129
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,880
the question must be asked whether these

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,100
Cloud instances and more generally

131
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,979
digital assets of private companies used

132
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,860
by armed forces and based outside the

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,680
countries involved in the conflict

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,840
extend the scope of the battlefield

135
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,139
and if they do would it be lawful for an

136
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,199
adversary to attack these clouds

137
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
cyberspace spans the globe with little

138
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,440
concern for geography and borders

139
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,199
Lincoln to these in a broader

140
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
perspective the four point of reflection

141
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,780
bringing to you today is the question of

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,300
whether private tech companies

143
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,220
providing their digital goods and

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,979
services to states that are parties to

145
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,620
an aren't confident with the result of a

146
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,720
military advantage

147
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
are themselves becoming part of the

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,300
conflict in principle private tech

149
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
companies properties are civilian

150
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,919
objects and workers of private tech

151
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,400
companies are civilians

152
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,440
knowing when tech companies employees

153
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,020
and properties are protected from being

154
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,160
attacked under International

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,960
humanitarian law

156
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,840
and when those protections are lost

157
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,880
particularly if employees directly

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,740
participate in hostilities and if

159
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,440
company property qualify as a military

160
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,220
objective is Paramount

161
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,199
answering these questions from a legal

162
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,780
point of view is challenging

163
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,780
but in practice there are operations

164
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,340
targeting private tech companies that

165
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,800
are perceived as conducting cyber

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,080
operations in support of one warring

167
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,180
party

168
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,880
a fifth trend is the provision of

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,220
digital offensive capabilities from

170
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,039
States involved into the conflict to the

171
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,020
civilian population

172
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,479
the digital space and ITS Technologies

173
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,880
make it possible during an armed

174
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,580
conflict to witness a conflict within a

175
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,520
conflict a conflict that beats civilians

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,979
against civilians denial of service

177
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,280
attacks website disruption

178
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,080
misinformation disinformation hate

179
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,419
speech campaigns and these are very

180
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,340
warring Trend as civilians should be

181
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,979
spared consequence of wars

182
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,139
the fact that digital tools are

183
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,300
distributed to civilians poses other

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,160
challenges

185
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,460
when a conflict finally comes to an end

186
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,220
where will those tools be

187
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,319
who is tracking the distribution

188
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,020
proliferation of such tools

189
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,720
can civilians who have been given the

190
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,720
kabad on these capabilities and train in

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,960
their use be expected to stop once

192
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,120
political leaders agree to a peace

193
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,199
Accord

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,840
or are there risks that these may be

195
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,539
misused in peace time

196
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,960
and finally my sixth point is that it is

197
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,780
no less alarming that these tools have

198
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,419
very different qualities ranging from

199
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,820
well-written and tested codes to

200
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,399
untested and buggy codes that are

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,458
quickly deployed in the fog of War

202
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,919
the lack of plural analysis during code

203
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,680
production and robust assessment during

204
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
testing can result

205
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,380
in unintended consequences digital tools

206
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,800
or malwares may not behave as expected

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,080
spread far behind the targeted

208
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,459
infrastructure

209
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,160
and result in unintended impacts what

210
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,440
so-called collateral damage on civilians

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,720
and civilian objects

212
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
or they can be ejected by other groups

213
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,540
with the purpose other purpose in mind

214
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,300
in the digital sector two standard will

215
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,140
have to be established in this respect

216
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,240
so as you can see from the sixth point I

217
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,519
have made today the digitalization of

218
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,220
armed confidence raises many challenges

219
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,300
in armed conflict digital civilians need

220
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,580
digital Technologies for remote

221
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,459
telemedicine digital cash transfer

222
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,700
family content and much more so digital

223
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,339
Technologies are exceptional assets for

224
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,040
humanitarians striving to alleviate the

225
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,740
suffering of populations are affected by

226
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,019
conflict and disasters

227
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,760
let's make sure that digital

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,160
Technologies are a Force for good and

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,339
not a source of suffering and that these

230
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,160
Technologies do not draw civilian closer

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,500
to the inner risk of warfare thank you

232
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,340
very much for inviting us

233
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:11,549
[Applause]
