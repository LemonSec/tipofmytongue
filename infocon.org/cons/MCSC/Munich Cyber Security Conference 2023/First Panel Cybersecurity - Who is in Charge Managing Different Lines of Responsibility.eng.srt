[Music]

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,380
welcome to this panel the first panel

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,000
which they've been kind enough to give

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,859
us essentially the same title as the

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,140
whole conference cyber security who is

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,580
in charge

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,039
um so I'm Kieran Martin the last time I

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,340
was here I was at the MC at the mcsc I

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,100
was head of the ncsc as Chris said I'm

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,520
now teaching so the pressure is off if I

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,780
say anything stupid it's just

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,280
embarrassing rather than Bringing Down

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,660
the government we've had quite enough of

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,980
that in the UK in recent in recent years

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,260
um in this panel on this really

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,480
important issue of who's in charge

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,360
um unlike the moderators initial remarks

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,219
on the first session where he said

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,260
people needed no introduction I think

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,360
people do need an introduction here but

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,920
not for the reason you might think it's

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,199
because I think the job titles listed in

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,540
your program do not convey the influence

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,400
impact and importance of the people

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
you've got to talk about this important

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,900
issue so I'll invite them up we have

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,260
head of cabinet to vice president xinas

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,180
who will hear from uh shortly but again

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,100
that doesn't convey her importance over

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
many years as the European Union has

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,140
gone from almost a bystander in cyber

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,720
security to a major driver of global

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
activity in cyber security

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,640
um we have Andreas Conan uh from uh

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
whose job title is director general for

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
cyber and information security at the

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
Federal Ministry of the interior and

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,220
community in Berlin but again that job

40
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,560
translates if you like into being

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,840
responsible for the major cyber threats

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,540
to German

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,820
national interests and critical

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,020
infrastructure and he's also a former

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,939
vice president of the German cyber

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,180
security Authority the excellent BSI we

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,000
have Rob Strayer who is

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,340
Executive Vice President of the policy

49
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,619
of policy at the information technology

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,800
Industry Council in Washington DC but a

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,360
pioneer of U.S led cyber diplomacy and a

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,640
senior um if you like cyber Diplomat

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
under the previous administration in

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
areas such as that secure technological

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
Supply chains that have translated into

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,360
policy in the in the current Biden

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,540
Administration and finally uh Kai Horton

58
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,420
who is a partner at Alto Partners

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,239
Germany a leading HR company but before

60
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,239
that former CEO of one of Germany's uh

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,120
most trusted defense Partners a former

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,099
military person he's the only one who

63
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,099
doesn't face the existential threat uh

64
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,780
the only one at the existential threat

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,700
of airport disruption because he's based

66
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,680
here in Munich where he's played a very

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,260
significant role in this conference so

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,220
with that I will resume my seat

69
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,480
and

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,860
um the first question I'm going to pose

71
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,300
to Kai if that's all right because very

72
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,739
often the government people get to speak

73
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,120
first so I thought it might make for a

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,159
novel change to ask the private sector

75
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,500
so we've got cyber security who is in

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,420
charge and in our panel we're accepting

77
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,920
that there are different lines of

78
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,300
responsibility but I'm going to give you

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,120
a chance here Kai because you have uh on

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,379
your right you have one of the most

81
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,420
influential policy makers for the

82
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,879
European Union uh for your own national

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,739
government and formerly one of the most

84
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,680
influential people in U.S cyber

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,480
diplomacy so what do you want from these

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,459
people and what do you not want from

87
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,300
them

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
when we're talking in the private sector

89
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,440
about who is in charge where do you want

90
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,879
to be left alone and where do you need

91
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,319
the help of some form of Public

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,940
Authority

93
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,959
well when you answering that and and

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,200
talking about the title as you say the

95
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,620
Blurred Lines of responsibility

96
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,659
that implies that there are rules and

97
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,840
that there is a kind of ruled based

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,239
order where

99
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,580
somebody puts up these rules and

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,659
somebody has the role of the sheriff who

101
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,760
makes sure that everybody plays along

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,180
these rules and finally that there is

103
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,120
also a legal system who makes sure that

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,940
the guys who break these rules uh go to

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,460
prison

106
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,180
well

107
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,240
from what I see in real life and this is

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,940
also what we see uh in global politics

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,080
these days

110
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,320
this rule-based approach in the world

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,580
doesn't really work and therefore

112
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,240
um

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,940
what we at other partners do recommend

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,280
to to our customers and this is also

115
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,199
what we are getting told by by many of

116
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,100
our clients is that you should make best

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,860
use of what state actors are offering

118
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,680
and you should cooperate with what they

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
are offering but also make sure that by

120
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,340
default your own organization is

121
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,280
waterproof and extremely strong and

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,860
resilient and that you should build on

123
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,100
the Triad of people process and

124
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,139
technology and it's not by coincidence

125
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,560
that I put people here first because

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
people starting on the boardroom and

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
across the entire organizations need to

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,220
have the awareness and the mindset

129
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,380
and the relevant know-how they need to

130
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,680
be trained and updated and cyber

131
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,440
security is team sports and uh like in

132
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,479
many sports you you better rehearse and

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
train what what people need to do across

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,400
the organ or organization so this is

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,280
this is where I would focus on corporate

136
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,400
and uh get the the good results there

137
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,320
and then also make sure that you have

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
the right people who have the the good

139
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,419
level of Integrity not only know-how but

140
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,840
that they really make sure that you can

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,419
rely on the people you have this is uh

142
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,880
not totally answering to your question

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,820
but uh it's it's not only you you cannot

144
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,320
rely in these Bloodlines uh on on

145
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,020
structures because experience shows that

146
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,600
often they would not work

147
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
extremely useful thank you and don't

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,660
worry after a career in government and

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,400
own a university I'm used to people not

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,900
answering questions but I think you made

151
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,060
a better job than many of so let me turn

152
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,300
to Despina you heard a lot about rules

153
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
and getting used to where they exist

154
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,319
where they do not exist you heard about

155
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,940
the importance of people and since I

156
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,880
last saw you pre-pandemic I mean the

157
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,560
eu's range of initiatives and your

158
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,539
legislative complement accomplishments

159
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,419
have been very considerable uh

160
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,400
regulation of critical infrastructure

161
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,560
through the two niz directives General

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,440
data protection cyber Security Act iot

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,300
regulation digital operational

164
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,699
resilience the list the list goes on so

165
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,259
I just wanted to give you the chance I

166
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,840
suppose to say what's been driving it

167
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,360
where do you see this going next and how

168
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,860
does it fit with what you've heard about

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,020
where people should be responsible for

170
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,880
their own security versus what you might

171
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,000
want rules and

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,020
Regulatory atmosphere you might want to

173
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,960
be setting at EU level

174
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,600
thank you I hope I can give as long an

175
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,180
answer as a question so

176
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,580
double please because Peter brought us

177
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,800
the timer there hello everyone thank you

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,419
very much it's really an honor to be

179
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,460
amongst all of you

180
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,919
um I I want to share a secret I I don't

181
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,960
know kai but I know very well Andres and

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,060
Rob not because we've had drinks

183
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,620
together actually we've never had that

184
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,520
but all these regulatory framework that

185
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
you mentioned has gone through a big

186
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,660
test because it was not obvious for the

187
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
EU to regulate all that it has regulated

188
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,400
be that critical infrastructure be that

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
what we did with our cyber security

190
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,020
agency certification the first place of

191
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,180
the world that has certification rules

192
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,240
it it went through a big test first with

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,860
people like Andreas Andres and I have

194
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,319
found ourselves in similar panels when

195
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,660
we as EU were trying to convince our own

196
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,180
member states that the EU had to have

197
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,400
common rules on cyber security standards

198
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
because what has been driving all this

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,860
is our notion of having a European Union

200
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,120
security system we didn't depart any

201
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,580
more on Cyber I'd like it in the past

202
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,460
from technology security we departed

203
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,440
from the security notion because since

204
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,139
2016 when we had these major terrorist

205
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,419
attacks and the EU our leader said we

206
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,159
need to move the EU to the security area

207
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
something that was not provided in the

208
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,539
treaties so for people like Andreas this

209
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,360
was really not easy to accept so we had

210
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,919
to have a lot of discussions to find the

211
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,599
right balance between what the members

212
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,520
can keep because security is a national

213
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,920
issue and what we need to do as the EU

214
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,779
because our systems are interconnected

215
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,940
and the geopolitical challenges are

216
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,959
common

217
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,080
and then once we did that I was

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,300
discussing with people like robe we've

219
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,760
met in Washington in our EU us dialogues

220
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,260
when we're trying to convince the U.S

221
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,120
government that the way to go is

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,860
regulation because this way we can

223
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,240
collaborate

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
um more and now I just heard camba who

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
said well we need to regulate what's not

226
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
regulated yet so we've come a long way

227
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
and it's it's very inspirational to see

228
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,200
what's going on in the U.S

229
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,779
so in the EU what we did is we started

230
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,060
first with resilience so this was uh the

231
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,500
first and nice directive we said let's

232
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,120
address critical infrastructures let's

233
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,060
make sure everybody has common rules put

234
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,680
reporting obligations

235
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,019
Etc prevention because this is what high

236
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,320
standards allow for so that was the

237
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,180
first level then we went to the second

238
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,640
level the second level is building more

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,459
on the Lessons Learned what we did with

240
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,200
nis2 so critical infrastructure

241
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,500
legislation is extend the scope so we

242
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,540
went beyond the traditional areas of

243
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,300
energy transport Healthcare banking Etc

244
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,720
to critical manufacturing sectors and we

245
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,339
did that before the pandemic so we

246
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,959
covered the Pharmaceuticals the medical

247
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,540
devices the food sector and and if you

248
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,800
look at what's happening in the world

249
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,839
today thank God we did that

250
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,940
and the other thing we did is to couple

251
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,500
that with the protection the physical

252
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,779
protection of our system so not just the

253
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,580
technological part but also the physical

254
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,820
security so we added legislation and

255
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,339
then we went the the second level also

256
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,380
required the security by Design and this

257
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,959
is the legislation we have on the table

258
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,360
and this is a future Direction security

259
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,240
by design by which we require our

260
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,040
products and services that circulate in

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
the market to meet cyber security

262
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,220
requirements now that's a first

263
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,920
worldwide very difficult I'm sure

264
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,260
Andreas will challenge me and this very

265
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,480
difficult for member states and this is

266
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,640
now the third level where we have to

267
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,800
work and the future Direction because

268
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,600
one of the reasons why member states are

269
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,399
resistant and why any government is

270
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,079
resistant is we don't have enough people

271
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,459
to do all that

272
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,740
so I think the challenge now for the EU

273
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,899
and anyone who is in the EU is that okay

274
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,760
I want to keep the rules where would I

275
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,800
find the people to implement it and

276
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
where will I as Government find the

277
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,399
people to enforce it because for every

278
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,860
rule there is a person at the end of the

279
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,920
chain more than one hopefully and this

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
is why you will hear later on our vice

281
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,240
president talking about the cyber

282
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
security skills academy something we are

283
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,959
enrolling now and we hope to adopt in

284
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,240
the next couple of months we want to

285
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,420
create a system by which we find ways to

286
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,640
to find the Integrity that you mentioned

287
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,279
of the people to find how we can train

288
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,079
people how we can bring more people in

289
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,660
how do you make sure these people are

290
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,940
validated by some system that allows you

291
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,120
to meet some criteria Etc so I think the

292
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,640
future direction for us is the challenge

293
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,620
of implementing what we have put in

294
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,760
place

295
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,519
we should have no illusions that this is

296
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,339
going to be difficult and the second is

297
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,500
integrating security by Design to

298
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,420
everything in our society this goes also

299
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,180
to what campus said in putting now the

300
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,160
honors more on the producers rather than

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,959
the end users so everything that comes

302
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,640
in the market has to meet security by

303
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,579
Design and third direction is finding

304
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,560
the peoples killing people upskilling

305
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,360
risk killing and making sure you have

306
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,820
the force for that and once you do that

307
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,560
to make sure you have an emergency

308
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
response because the war that is going

309
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
on has shown us more than ever

310
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,399
that you need to be ready

311
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,860
and in the EU it is the first time we

312
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,320
have spoken about cyber defense

313
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,839
member states did not allow us to use

314
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,579
the word defense in the EU because it

315
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,540
was not the European Union capacity and

316
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,060
jurisdiction but now we decided we need

317
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,800
to go ahead with that and bring in

318
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,959
defense also in the world of cyber thank

319
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,860
you

320
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,839
thank you can I ask a quick follow-up I

321
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,399
promise it's quick

322
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,600
um really interested in what you said

323
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,880
about testing regulations how did you do

324
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
it and what difference did it make

325
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,620
what do you mean testing when you said

326
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,899
when you were developing the regulations

327
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,660
you tested it well we went things that

328
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,060
you do we consult heavily with our and

329
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,040
and the great thing in in Europe is that

330
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,320
we have different groups that deal with

331
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,940
different aspects of cyber security we

332
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,680
have operational teams from all the

333
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,720
member states from other governments but

334
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,000
we also have policy makers we have the

335
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
NIS established Corporation group for

336
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
everything we do we we need their okay

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,700
so we we have all the four are necessary

338
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,860
to consult the governments and then for

339
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,600
every piece of legislation as you know

340
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,160
that we put forward we need to consult

341
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,260
industry we need to have impact

342
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,180
assessment so none of the things we've

343
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,160
done has been done just because we

344
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,440
thought it was a good idea

345
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,180
thank you I'll bring an address now

346
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,160
you've been invited to bring some

347
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,740
challenge we've had the we've had

348
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,120
perspectives from the German private

349
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
sector from the EU level what what does

350
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,700
concern you and what do you think the

351
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,320
proper role of a big national government

352
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,079
like yours is in the Blurred Lines of

353
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,600
responsibility and cyber security

354
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
okay uh taking over from this Fina I

355
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,680
could just mention the situation that we

356
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,899
are now as a federal government for

357
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,300
example in asset which positioned at

358
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,019
least since in this too that again the

359
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,600
case so what do I mean by that actually

360
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
we put a strong emphasis in protecting

361
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,639
critical infrastructures in the

362
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,680
cyberspace in Germany since a long time

363
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,060
we started out I remember in 2005 or

364
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,019
2006 uh with a cooperation with the

365
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,899
critical infrastructure on a voluntary

366
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,260
basis and so actually we had a long

367
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,040
experience in dealing with critical

368
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,139
infrastructures in the cyberspace and we

369
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,839
became aware of the fact that in

370
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,100
implementing some common rules we didn't

371
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,180
succeed in any sectors and in any

372
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,579
branches so the final decision was

373
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,639
actually to come up with regulation and

374
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,120
to make them to push them forward that

375
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,399
were too reluctant to enter The

376
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,820
Cooperative approach and so actually we

377
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,000
came up with the first uh it is Gazette

378
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,860
in 2015 and actually uh it was a winning

379
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,600
uh law and by the fact that actually we

380
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,320
succeeded in getting all in of the of

381
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,279
the sectors electricity uh or water

382
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,740
supply or whatever you couldn't imagine

383
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,940
even branches that were very far away

384
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,519
from the questions how to deal with

385
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,880
digitalization and with the threats

386
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,160
coming out of cyberspace and this

387
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,339
approach and so in some sense we were a

388
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,279
test case in what then happened in the

389
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,440
European Union and the European Union

390
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,320
has established since then uh

391
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,540
continuously growing interest in

392
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,839
protecting the critical infrastructures

393
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,199
and that's something that joins us today

394
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,540
that brings us together the commission

395
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,779
as the one setting the com rules for the

396
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,660
com Market on one hand but also for the

397
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,220
member State and the critical

398
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,560
infrastructures we have to deal with and

399
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,360
which we have to protect

400
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,480
the implementation is still with the

401
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,399
federal government and it's with the

402
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,680
governments of all member states and so

403
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
we are playing a very important role now

404
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
to make it work and that gets more and

405
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,860
important if we look back at the 24th of

406
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,680
February last year when it became clear

407
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,740
that not only the Cyber Arena has to be

408
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,740
looked upon but also still the physical

409
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,160
world has to be

410
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,100
looked into carefully but the commission

411
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,759
was already on its way the CEO directive

412
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,639
is a very important thing that helped us

413
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
a lot now in establishing for example

414
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,459
our own roof law concerning the

415
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,740
protection of critical infrastructure we

416
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,040
are now going to find a common approach

417
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,859
between the physical world and the

418
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,020
protection of the cyber world and

419
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,419
actually that's something that's taken

420
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,000
on by the EU level in giving us a common

421
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,119
rule rule common rules not only in the

422
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,740
sense of a law but also in

423
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
standardization of processes

424
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,419
standardization of products of Supply

425
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,760
chains and much more if I look for

426
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,000
example in the CRA

427
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,360
act that will come up so in the end we

428
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,500
have a role that now even more worth

429
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,160
when I look at the BSI for example it

430
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,380
gets now not only the chance to

431
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,140
interact with the

432
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,240
branches like telecommunications on a

433
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,460
federal level but also gets a chance to

434
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,100
dive into responsibilities of the

435
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,080
federal state to find out how to

436
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,840
collaborate with them and to push

437
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,360
implementation even further down the

438
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,860
line

439
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,900
that's great thanks Andres and I might

440
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,940
come back to the point that both Despina

441
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,679
and Kai raised about people and the

442
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,419
constraints they post but just in the

443
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,919
interest of time let me bring in Rob for

444
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,440
a moment on the overall sort of uh

445
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,380
picture so um when we talk about who's

446
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,500
in charge I mean to some in Europe the

447
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,299
answer might well be well if you sit

448
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,039
back and think about it quite often it's

449
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,539
the United States

450
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,200
um it's where so much of the corporate

451
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,360
production of Technology comes from it's

452
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
the most powerful government uh in the

453
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,900
world in a sense Andreas is talking

454
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,760
about perhaps being a sandwich between

455
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,539
uh the uh the EU structures and German

456
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,799
business

457
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,140
um to torture the metaphor you know if

458
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,179
if the German federal government is the

459
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,100
sandwich is it the US that's making the

460
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,820
bread and how and uh you know to what

461
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,320
extent does the US think about this and

462
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,940
how does it think about the impact of

463
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,400
its uh think about the impact of its

464
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
activities everything from uh the role

465
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
of its private sector all the way

466
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,740
through to things like the foreign

467
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,200
direct product rule in setting Global

468
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,900
cyber security standards

469
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,580
great great question

470
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,860
um I I can address that in part from my

471
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,940
time when I was working for the state

472
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,140
department talking to other governments

473
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,000
and working with Despina Andreas and you

474
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,860
on a regular basis to talk about these

475
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,440
issues the United States fully knows

476
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,059
that it needs to play a leadership role

477
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,179
here in uh on cyber security and setting

478
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,679
Norms I mean the two most important

479
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,539
Norms being one country should not

480
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,860
disrupt another country's critical

481
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,440
infrastructure and that when there is a

482
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,820
cyber threat emanating from one's

483
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,960
territory they need to take action

484
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,900
against it that those Norms need to be

485
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,820
inculcated into a broader understanding

486
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,460
and if necessary tools of diplomacy and

487
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,080
even stronger tools of deterrence used

488
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,299
to get countries to come to abide by

489
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,100
those rules that's been a long-standing

490
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,700
U.S policy and it continues on the area

491
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,380
that's become the more I think

492
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,380
interesting evolution of our time about

493
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,140
technology competition uh it's

494
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,520
absolutely vital for the United States

495
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,080
they're leading on that but it's vital

496
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
that they cooperate with other

497
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,980
governments to be successful there is no

498
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,039
regime for export controls or for

499
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,140
investment screening that will work or

500
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,600
succeed in any longer period of time if

501
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,640
it doesn't have multilateral buy-in

502
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,440
there will always be ways for Capital

503
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,419
and Technology to move to other

504
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,940
locations that aren't Bound by rules if

505
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,799
there's not truly a global order with

506
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
regard to those Technologies

507
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,760
I think the other thing that's really

508
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,260
important to think about everyone in

509
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,419
this room is well aware of the nature of

510
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,400
the internet and that cyber threats are

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,980
cross-border as we address those threats

512
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,900
from the private sector perspective it's

513
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,580
really important to know that we're only

514
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,620
going to address those recognizing the

515
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,080
cross-border nature of our supply chains

516
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,900
and the way we address markets there is

517
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,059
no company virtually today certainly the

518
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,559
top end but I didn't mean down to the

519
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,660
Venture Capital Stage Company that is

520
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,880
not developing their software globally

521
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,919
not just in one country not just in

522
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,660
Silicon Valley it's a global Enterprise

523
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
if they're doing Hardware they're doing

524
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,440
hardware and in multiple jurisdictions

525
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,640
at once

526
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
so it's important that as we develop

527
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,059
cyber security rules that those are

528
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,860
harmonized around the globe so we don't

529
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,960
fragment markets the two things that

530
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,539
companies need they need to be able to

531
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,220
scale to reach multiple markets they

532
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,900
don't want to have to develop different

533
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,200
types of technology for each market

534
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,160
there's one country out there that

535
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,320
already has 1.3 billion people in their

536
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,059
indigenous market so we shouldn't

537
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,280
further fragment Western markets or

538
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,860
other addressable markets for the world

539
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,380
and they need certainty about what those

540
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,179
regulations will look like in the future

541
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,520
and that's where Andres has touched on

542
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,960
International standards that's where

543
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,820
they become so important because that

544
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,340
really is where private sector companies

545
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,140
know it's in their economic interests to

546
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,720
develop the best standards on cyber

547
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,860
security they're developing those

548
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,020
consistently in multiple standard bodies

549
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,700
including the international standards

550
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,080
organization they have a joint

551
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,580
relationship with the international

552
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,380
Electro technical commission called

553
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,600
Joint techno committee one it's a huge

554
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,220
mouthful but that's where a lot of great

555
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,720
cyber standards are being developed

556
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,480
constantly including iot security

557
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,039
you know our recommendation for on

558
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,320
behalf of tech sector is that as the

559
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,059
European Union looks to implement the

560
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,700
Cyber resilience act that we are able to

561
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,799
look at these International standards so

562
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,080
we don't fragment our approach to cyber

563
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,940
security and that we really have

564
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,980
Industries full buy-in along the way so

565
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,299
that's the other I think main point is

566
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,919
that we do all of our cyber security

567
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,840
with International standards as the

568
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,539
basis okay so you're taking a an

569
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:34,860
internationalist approach from U.S

570
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,059
perspective can just ask a quick

571
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,200
follow-up and then I'd like to bring

572
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
Despina back in from a for an EU

573
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,980
perspective where do you think we are in

574
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,720
terms of having the mechanisms for that

575
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,760
sort of cooperation to promote that

576
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,799
alignment harmonization because it's

577
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,240
different from cooperating say an

578
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
operational security

579
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,419
um how far do you think we are are we in

580
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,740
the right place the wrong place are we

581
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,020
going in the right direction

582
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,059
well it's it's no secret that large

583
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,679
multinational corporations are involved

584
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,600
in these major standards bodies and

585
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,460
they're also involved in Etsy in one of

586
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,539
the three European standards

587
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,679
organizations they're also involved in

588
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,720
Senate send and send elect to the extent

589
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,760
that they're permitted to do so uh that

590
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
could be a longer dive into standards

591
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
that we don't want to get into here but

592
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,559
I I think that is it's it's it's

593
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,140
happening and you know forums for

594
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,820
discussion among government leaders are

595
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,960
really important to make sure that

596
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,820
they're orienting themselves to be able

597
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,840
to take advantage of international

598
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,520
standards

599
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,380
may I bring you back in just been out of

600
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,000
this how would you characterize the

601
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,299
state of EU us discussions on cyber

602
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,400
security and if you like tech security

603
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,679
more generally and likes of what Rob has

604
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,539
been saying

605
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,679
so um we we haven't established the EU

606
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,480
us Dialogue on cyber security for some

607
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,120
years now and and Rob was leading that

608
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,400
for the U.S side for a while

609
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,659
um but

610
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,940
because there is no formal cooperation

611
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,700
in security it was very much an exchange

612
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,820
of views and because we had very

613
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,440
different approaches with the US I need

614
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,720
to be very Frank here it was not

615
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,900
extremely meaningful we were borrowing

616
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,120
ideas maybe from each other but we were

617
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,159
not doing things together this has

618
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
changed recently we saw a big wave of

619
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
change in the regulatory approach of the

620
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,140
U.S after the pipeline incident which

621
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,780
brought similar measures to the EU ones

622
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,320
in the U.S and since then we have seen a

623
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,360
real life scale of the U.S dialogue the

624
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,039
last one took place at the end of last

625
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,100
year and following that we even made a

626
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,840
kind of partnership between the homeland

627
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,780
security department and the European

628
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,820
commission where we work on specific

629
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,460
issues and I think that is extremely

630
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,620
promising

631
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,539
our first partnership was on ransomware

632
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,659
following the pipeline incident now we

633
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,520
have taken it further on exchanging

634
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,460
information between us Cesar and Anisa

635
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,320
the European agency in the U.S agency

636
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
and I think that's the way to go so I

637
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,280
think it's very promising and that

638
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,500
despite other politics we have managed

639
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,100
in the last few months to start aligning

640
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,340
so a big change there very encouraging

641
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,740
exchange thank you let's switch tack a

642
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,120
little bit and go back to the human

643
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,900
element you raised the point about

644
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,179
skills and capacity constraints

645
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,100
um but I might bring Kai back in you've

646
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,880
heard from multiple different

647
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,460
levels of of government activity how

648
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,080
does it feel to you as someone who does

649
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,279
specialize

650
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,919
um now in the human dimensions of these

651
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,460
problems how realistic and practical do

652
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,260
you think the various Innovations have

653
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,179
been and what might like what might you

654
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,480
like to see change if anything well if I

655
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,340
was a bit skeptical in the beginning I

656
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,039
would like first to acknowledge that a

657
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,159
huge progress has been made in

658
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
regulation and legislation and from from

659
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,020
that aspect I think we can be proud and

660
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,260
on the other hand when if not now this

661
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,059
progress should have should have

662
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,320
happened

663
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,299
um on the sidelines it still only takes

664
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,779
taking out one glass fiber line in order

665
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,820
to paralyze a railway system or an

666
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,880
airport which might raise questions on

667
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,020
resilience

668
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,440
I think that also underpins then that we

669
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,779
still have a long way to go and it is a

670
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,320
marathon and we see that the need for

671
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,380
for skilled people is everywhere from my

672
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,900
point of view too many people still see

673
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,299
that only at seasonal level and the

674
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,820
Nerds and the in the basement who take

675
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,179
care of cyber security and I think there

676
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,120
everybody should see and understand that

677
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,940
this goes all across the Pyramid of any

678
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,860
organization be the government be it a

679
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,200
company it starts at board level it must

680
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,320
be on the risk screen the awareness for

681
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,200
cyber issues goes from The Boardroom

682
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
through the middle management down to

683
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,360
the Specialists and this is on on all

684
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,520
these levels hierarchy levels within in

685
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,039
organizations you need people who have

686
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,919
the right mindset the right or the right

687
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
basic training the right continue

688
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,299
training rehearsal and this is something

689
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,720
which I see in some some areas but there

690
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,659
are still too many who see this as a

691
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,080
niche knowledge and and think that the

692
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,640
Specialists can make sure that nothing

693
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,580
happens and I think there the people are

694
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,500
on the false track

695
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,720
really interesting and anybody come in

696
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,179
if you want but I might if no one jumps

697
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,580
in uh asks the next question of Andreas

698
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,440
which is

699
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,260
building on those points you are if you

700
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,720
like a significant National risk owner

701
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,960
you are responsible for defending and

702
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,880
setting the policy for defending uh

703
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,120
National Security cyber equities in uh

704
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,220
in in Germany and we've just heard from

705
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,380
Kai a bunch of things around what

706
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,880
organization should be doing from

707
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,740
themselves they should be influenced by

708
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,600
the atmosphere set by governments by the

709
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
rules set by governments but they have

710
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,779
some of their own responsibilities

711
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,500
really interested in your point of view

712
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,320
as someone working at a senior level in

713
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,539
a very strategically significant

714
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,520
national government what do you expect

715
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,700
people to be doing for themselves and

716
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,260
just the government not having to worry

717
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,580
about it and when do you think the

718
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,860
national government really will have to

719
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,779
step in

720
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,020
yeah actually I'm expecting a lot uh

721
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,179
from for example the companies of the

722
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,340
critical infrastructures because they

723
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,620
own the critical infrastructures they

724
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,260
are the ones running it uh for the

725
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,620
People of Our member states and so

726
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,960
actually they have to deliver their

727
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
service with digital methods but with

728
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,580
secure digital methods so everything

729
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,940
applies that was already mentioned uh

730
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,820
concerning standardization or security

731
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,940
by Design or having skilled people

732
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,340
um at their sites that's really

733
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,059
important where I see the role of for

734
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,279
example the federal government coming in

735
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,700
is actually where it goes towards the

736
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,340
cyber security situation

737
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,240
in Germany or in Europe or worldwide we

738
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,600
are the ones uh to deliver bases for

739
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,299
collecting the relevant information and

740
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,580
giving relevant information to the

741
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,980
critical infrastructures especially when

742
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,520
it comes to questions where it can't be

743
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,700
seen by one company or one branch or one

744
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,860
sector where we have to have an

745
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,620
overarching picture of this of the

746
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,320
threat landscape and where we have to

747
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,320
give clear-cut advice what could be done

748
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,559
to tackle one or the other risk so

749
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,600
that's the most important point for that

750
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,779
we have to even more and large and to

751
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,299
push up our cyber security Response

752
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,960
Center for example but we also have to

753
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,720
go further on in cooperating not only

754
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,880
between the businesses and the

755
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,899
government but also to collaborate with

756
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,059
the federal States government that play

757
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,120
an important role in Germany in uh

758
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,360
fighting threats from the beginning

759
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,580
thanks very much and Rob if there's been

760
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,860
one place in the world where I suppose

761
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,840
to date the answer to who's in charge

762
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,399
and cyber security has been it's the

763
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,260
individual company it's been the United

764
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,279
States

765
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,960
um as we've been hearing

766
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,240
um you know reluctance to get into the

767
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,419
regulatory space I suppose as an analyst

768
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,159
of the current situation no longer in

769
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,380
government do you do you see that

770
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,700
changing in the way that we've been

771
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,200
discussed already and do you think

772
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,020
that's broadly good or bad thing and

773
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,580
what sort of implications do you think

774
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,740
it will have if the federal government

775
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,539
starts getting a bit more active in this

776
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,440
space

777
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,299
yeah it's certainly true that is the

778
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,860
trend line that we're on

779
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,320
um just last February just a year ago we

780
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,720
adopted I think our first rather strong

781
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,419
cyber security law which was a national

782
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,059
incident reporting law for uh critical

783
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,440
infrastructure

784
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,600
I think it's really important as these

785
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,279
regulations and laws are developed that

786
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,799
we keep the end goal in mind which is we

787
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,840
want to see more robust cooperation

788
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,460
between the government and the private

789
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,600
sector

790
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,120
so as you put burdens on the private

791
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,559
sector report data you want to make sure

792
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,640
that data is something the government

793
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,860
can actually use and it's something they

794
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,740
can operationalize

795
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,820
that because there's always a cost the

796
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,200
private sector have to comply with these

797
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,700
regulations there's always a risk as we

798
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,140
think about the next regulation that

799
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,480
we're chasing the last threat and a

800
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,980
variety of new vectors are being opened

801
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,320
up all the time by creative actors in

802
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,480
the world so we need to be careful that

803
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,640
we are always adaptive and that's why I

804
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,539
come back again to the international

805
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,799
standards because that's an important

806
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,419
way that we can set standards that are

807
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,559
adaptable over time but

808
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,120
certainly the United States is on a

809
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,380
trend to have more regulation and

810
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,640
empowering more of its sector-specific

811
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,860
agencies to do more regulation

812
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,020
um which you know companies are going to

813
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,919
comply with that and they're going to

814
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,240
come up with their best practices in

815
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,799
these areas and

816
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,840
um I think that in the long term can be

817
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,279
fine but it needs to have that really

818
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,600
strong collaboration the private sector

819
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,460
and what advice would you give to the

820
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,380
U.S government as it develops these

821
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,179
regulations about how it interacts with

822
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,580
the private sector well the easiest one

823
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,320
is that any of the regulations that are

824
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,640
being written really needs to be done in

825
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,320
close collaboration with the private

826
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,059
sector as they're thinking about what

827
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,100
the new measures are I mean we're seeing

828
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,600
the threats day to day we've somehow

829
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,580
some of the best visibility of what's

830
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,799
happening to both our companies when

831
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,120
they're in the case of cyber security

832
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,760
companies but also all I.T companies are

833
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,340
really all tech companies uh in the

834
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,840
world now every company's a tech company

835
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,299
they're seeing the threat so it's

836
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,520
important that the tool be matched to

837
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,100
what their needs are and any regulation

838
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,140
related to it say in the form of cyber

839
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,419
insta reporting is done in ways that

840
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,740
make sense you know there's some

841
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,500
proposals now that we would have a

842
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,419
reporting of exploitable vulnerabilities

843
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,399
without the remediation already being

844
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,799
figured out and that's going to only

845
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,559
cause more problems for uh companies to

846
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,840
create more risk in the global ecosystem

847
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,460
and I very much want to bring in Despina

848
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,940
at this point on the company aspect

849
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,799
on the private sector in the EU we're

850
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,799
not just in the business of putting on

851
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,740
obligations and burdens in fact we're

852
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,480
looking into how to involve more the

853
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,000
private sector we see great difficulty

854
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,620
from the private sector in reporting

855
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,019
incidents which is an obligation under

856
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,600
the NIS so we would like to encourage

857
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,720
that and if we learned one lesson from

858
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,880
their Russian aggression against Ukraine

859
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,440
is the importance of involving the

860
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,440
private sector in in big situations and

861
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,440
in difficult situations so when we're

862
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,820
building for instance a cyber security

863
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,100
skills academy we're trying to see how

864
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,100
to Value existing initiatives and

865
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,200
existing trainings or whatever exists in

866
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,640
the private sector because we want to

867
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,380
bring in the experience of the private

868
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,140
sector to the public sector and another

869
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,940
thing we have announced recently in our

870
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,340
cyber defense approach is how to bring

871
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,320
in the private sector also to help

872
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,880
governments in case of emergency

873
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,580
response and that is a first we need to

874
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,460
see how to get it right but this is

875
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,380
about really building in the

876
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,639
collaboration

877
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,560
really struck by that point about it's

878
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,418
not all about setting obligations so

879
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,040
we've got just under nine minutes left

880
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,780
so about two minutes per person I'm

881
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,460
scared of yellow and red cards and also

882
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,580
we um we also can't overrun into uh just

883
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,619
mean his boss's keynote

884
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:23,520
um so

885
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,719
um

886
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,060
just for a sort of closing answer I'm

887
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,260
sorry to start with you Kyle we'll work

888
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,760
our way along give the final word to

889
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,260
dismina

890
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,339
um

891
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,040
given that point about it's not just

892
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,599
about imposing obligations and you're at

893
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,859
the sharp end of what the obligations

894
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,139
might be

895
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,060
what things might you want to see less

896
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,839
of

897
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,879
what things might you want to see more

898
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,199
of and what would you like to see done

899
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,820
differently in terms of the various

900
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,760
actors and what they're doing in cyber

901
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,099
security rulemaking

902
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,500
well what I would like to see more is

903
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,440
speed and efficiency what I would like

904
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,260
to see less is redundancies in

905
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,320
structures if you look at just take the

906
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,380
the German example I'm a big believer in

907
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,619
in our federal system but as it was

908
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,660
stated by the state Ministry before if

909
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,240
we have 200 entities on state level in

910
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,180
Germany employed in cyber security this

911
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,400
assumption might not be wrong that there

912
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,339
is also a race for for talents Within

913
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,220
These 200

914
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,200
institutions which at the end of the day

915
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,160
may may lead to the to the result that

916
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
there are not enough wealth skilled

917
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,140
Specialists Within These institutions so

918
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,079
this is something where I think

919
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,420
a glimpse of of if efficiency would help

920
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,359
right and Rob something less of

921
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,800
something more of and something done

922
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,619
differently perhaps more of is you know

923
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,800
defining the tools and processes that we

924
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
want in place between the government and

925
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,099
the private sector to be more effective

926
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,040
at our at our end goals I think less of

927
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,400
is go to loan strategies by governments

928
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,740
that don't that are not consistent with

929
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,599
International standards and cause

930
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,520
further fragmentation in the global

931
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,060
system that just increases cost and it's

932
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,500
going to take a lot a lot of time to

933
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,300
Iron those out if they're done in a way

934
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,560
that's not symmetrical with other

935
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,960
governments who are also willing to come

936
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,640
to the table and work together with the

937
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,440
private sector on this

938
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,200
great Andreas

939
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,079
yeah what I would like to see more is

940
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,560
clearly uh to Define priorities uh to

941
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,839
overcome especially the problem with the

942
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,540
200 entities not all of them have the

943
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,640
same responsibilities some of them are

944
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,220
really necessary for driving cyber

945
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,160
security forward but actually the scene

946
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,119
is set only uh by let's say maximum two

947
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,760
handful of players that's important to

948
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,720
have more of this priority set I want to

949
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,180
see less

950
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,880
yeah paperware done actually we have to

951
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,700
come into implementation issues to have

952
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,859
real security working in the

953
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,079
infrastructures and not write one

954
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,859
strategy or one concept after the other

955
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:15,540
clearly we need those Concepts we have

956
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,119
to make sure and clear what our

957
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,460
structures look like but we don't have

958
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,619
to put it in the middle of what we are

959
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,780
doing we have to put the security itself

960
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,660
in the middle so what we have to do

961
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,359
differently exactly those were we have

962
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,460
to have the change going to less of

963
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,700
paper and more of priority

964
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,500
thank you and last word to you Despina

965
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,000
and what you'd like to see change and

966
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,440
more or less of

967
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,839
um I mean we all want to see less cyber

968
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,660
attacks that's for sure and I think to

969
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,119
do that we need to do less talk and more

970
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,420
operational work in cyber security also

971
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,720
as governments more more professionals

972
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
the problem of skills that we're

973
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,339
advocating all of us I think that's very

974
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,140
important and differently I think we

975
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,640
have to do our collaboration differently

976
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,500
be that between public and private

977
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,720
sector but also collaboration across the

978
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,240
world between governments

979
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,680
well an awful lot there um calls for

980
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,420
greater prioritization for efficiency

981
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,859
and perhaps streamlining some of the

982
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,960
proliferation of bodies uh getting

983
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,339
involved in this stuff I've taken a key

984
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,020
thing from the whole of this discussion

985
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,060
around after a period of quite a lot of

986
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,040
activity particularly in Europe focusing

987
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,900
on implementation and getting smart

988
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,540
about implementation and a lot of that

989
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,900
relates to gaps in skills a very

990
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,760
interesting set of discussions about

991
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,740
making sure that we don't fragment and

992
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,380
not having God alone uh strategies that

993
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,960
we as a group of like-minded countries

994
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
with similar interests and transnational

995
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,300
companies and so forth stick to to

996
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,359
together on all of this

997
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,560
um there's a whole bunch of other things

998
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,020
that I will have uh missed but I will

999
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,780
conclude with Kai's request for Speed

1000
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,599
