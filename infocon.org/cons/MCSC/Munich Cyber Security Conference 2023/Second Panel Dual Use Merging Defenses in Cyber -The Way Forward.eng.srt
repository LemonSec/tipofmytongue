1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,900
foreign

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:13,580
[Music]

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,900
I think this panel will in particular

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,800
Focus really on the convergence

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,380
between the civil and Military world and

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,779
cyber security with a particular focus

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,340
on the military domain because obviously

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,520
one cannot no longer disconnect one from

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,559
the other

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,780
and I have a very distinguished panel

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,559
here from all over the world and while

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,500
the question was asked before I want to

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,660
start off with one off-topic question

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,680
and I'm asking that to Mika do you think

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,539
that NATO needs a balloon Force

16
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,000
perhaps just 99 Luft balloons

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,920
that was not practiced it's it's it's a

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,300
really nice intro

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,799
um but I would what we really want to

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,780
start with is really with the experience

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,420
in in Ukraine and we want to dive a

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
little deeper even though Chris already

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,619
mentioned it a little bit and with

24
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,720
Sandra and Mika we can you know really

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,420
provide some Frontline uh experience

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,380
here

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,100
and um maybe Mika you want to start by

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,860
going a little bit into detail about

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,500
um how cyber security was perceived

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,200
before the invasion of Ukraine and how

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
it looked like after because as we look

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,439
at it right now

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,060
um and it seems that Munitions is more

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,600
important than cyber and also how that

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,060
relates maybe to a potential conflict in

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,700
Taiwan which has been discussed in

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,040
policy circles so maybe maybe you start

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,380
off on that yeah

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,540
I think this is on um thank you very

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,180
much I I think it's been a it's been

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,500
very interesting for me to be at the

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,360
Department of Defense at this particular

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,299
time because we are now seeing for the

44
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,299
first time cyber in the context of armed

45
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,880
conflict and so much of what we thought

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,819
about cyber previously was hypothetical

47
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,340
to that and we thought that cyber would

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,739
have this tremendous huge strategic

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,160
impact cyber Pearl Harbor cyber 911 and

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,540
we thought it would have that kind of

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,260
shock the conscience impact but what

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,420
we've seen in Russia and Ukraine is that

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,379
when you put cyber alongside of kinetic

54
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,500
that it actually pales in comparison

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,140
that those cyber disruptions that would

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,580
have had they occurred in peace time

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,060
have the potential to cause that kind of

58
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,840
um panic and and response that when you

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,980
see that alongside of missile strikes it

60
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,959
is actually

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,480
um it puts it in context what does it

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
mean for the ukrainians if they are

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,780
disrupt if their grid is disrupted for

64
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,640
four hours via cyber and then are able

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,519
to restore service versus the ukrainians

66
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,319
having the grid

67
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,440
um and the the substations destroyed the

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,959
physicality of that matters a lot and so

69
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,540
we learn things like

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,580
um data localization could be a

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,280
vulnerability if your data center is

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,340
localized inside the range of missiles

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,920
that the Ukrainian ability to migrate to

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,640
the cloud was a strategic move for them

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,159
to be able to retain essential data

76
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,800
we've learned things like the Cyber

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,080
disruptions while as important as they

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,080
may be may not be as important as the

79
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,879
information environment and the

80
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,400
narrative that could come out and so

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,799
um Kevin Walden talked about the ability

82
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,260
of the president of Ukraine to get his

83
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,239
message out and to Rally his people but

84
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,580
it wasn't just that the ways in which

85
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,620
Ukrainian Network Defenders were able to

86
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,319
keep their population informed but also

87
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,420
sharing with the world what was

88
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,599
happening to them it made all of those

89
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,099
people who are filming videos and

90
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,319
putting them out on the internet into

91
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
reporters of their own conflict and so

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
in some ways what we see in cyber what

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,120
we have learned about this is very

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,439
different than what we thought it would

95
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,540
be and I think we the Department of

96
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,858
Defense have also learned a lot of

97
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,738
lessons about the challenges of using

98
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,440
offensive cyber in the context of armed

99
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,540
conflict

100
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,400
again Kemba talked about how cyber

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,780
offense is hard and I think that the

102
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,460
Russians found it much harder than they

103
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,139
thought it would be I would just say in

104
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,340
the Department of Defense we do hard

105
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,780
things every day

106
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,440
um

107
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,860
but I think it it it shows you that

108
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,580
while we have this perception that cyber

109
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,979
moves at the speed of the internet in

110
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,440
fact doing cyber takes tremendous

111
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,380
planning and preparation in advance both

112
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,060
on offense and defense and if you are

113
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,400
trying to do those things at the point

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,199
of Crisis or at the point of conflict

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,020
you are probably too late to the fight

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,180
to actually be able to either defend

117
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,160
your networks or deliver offensive cyber

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,419
the way that you need to those things

119
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,300
must be planned far in advance which is

120
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,280
a very important lesson for us when we

121
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,780
look ahead to the possibility of

122
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,139
conflict in the indo-pacific that the

123
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,660
ukrainians had the advantage of years of

124
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,540
preparation of being hit by Russian

125
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,520
cyber attacks years in advance of that

126
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,100
to harden their Network defenses

127
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,440
we have to think about what we have seen

128
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,720
in this Con in this conflict and make

129
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,120
sure that we are preparing people as

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,440
people throughout the asia-pacific

131
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,940
region throughout the world are thinking

132
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,940
about the possibility of conflict

133
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,100
conflict needs to be in your risk

134
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
management framework for cyber

135
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,539
thank you

136
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,380
um and then I would say Sandra you um

137
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,419
you obviously have experience in

138
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,580
protecting Ukraine together with other

139
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,800
vendors maybe you can tell a little bit

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,380
more about what you experienced and also

141
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,560
maybe how you saw Ukraine impacting

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,919
potential attacks on other important

143
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,660
companies in the defense industrial base

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,180
maybe you can elaborate a little bit on

145
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,100
that but it's quite interesting right

146
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,259
what you're saying is that certainly

147
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,360
from a governmental level there was a

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,759
lot of support for Ukraine but the

149
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,800
actual support was not really done by

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,080
the military as we classically do with

151
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,820
air defense or something like that but

152
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,500
actually by lots of vendors private

153
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,900
sector vendors right so

154
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,580
well I'm happy to talk a little bit

155
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,139
about what we've learned and if there's

156
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,940
anything good that's come from years and

157
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,000
years of Reckless Russian uh cyber

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,280
aggression it's we've we've mapped out

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
enumerated quite a bit of their

160
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,720
capability one thing that we learned

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,100
right off the bat with some of the

162
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,139
incident response work that we do is

163
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,900
that the Russian cyber capability was

164
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,060
actually had persistence in the networks

165
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,060
there for many years that is an

166
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,220
important thing for us to realize is

167
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,560
that in some cases they had persistence

168
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,699
for

169
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,340
um you know more than five years in

170
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,840
these networks before they were able to

171
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,880
deploy wipers so what does that mean it

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,060
means that they've maintained strategic

173
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,000
optionality as you know they've been um

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,500
you know conducting these these

175
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
operations over time another thing that

176
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,199
we learned from there is as Russian

177
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,000
forces were advancing and we were in

178
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
communication with some of the the

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
individuals that we were supporting it

180
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,780
became clear that some of these networks

181
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,180
have are being overtaken by Russian

182
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,259
forces as as different areas were were

183
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,419
traversed so what that means is we

184
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,220
didn't know at least I didn't know

185
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,340
before that a lot of these forces had

186
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,740
embedded cyber action teams people who

187
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,840
had the ability to go into an occupied

188
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
area and take over networks that means

189
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,020
we need to be thinking about

190
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,060
segmentation we need to be thinking

191
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,979
about that type of resilience in the

192
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,319
event that we have some other kinetic

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,539
conflict whether in this theater or or

194
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,419
somewhere else if we think about the

195
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,440
magnitude of of the I would say the the

196
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,060
destructive attacks in the beginning

197
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,660
the tempo was was pretty alarming if you

198
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,400
think about it what we observed in the

199
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,680
first days of the invasion of Kiev and

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,780
even I think two wipers that were

201
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,599
deployed before the invasion was that

202
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,419
this flurry of activity was definitely

203
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,139
part of a you know an augmentation to

204
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,940
the actual kinetic Invasion itself

205
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,639
because we saw more wipers deployed in

206
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,340
that let's say four-month period than we

207
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,459
had observed in the last eight years

208
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,820
so with that we know that it is as as my

209
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,919
colleague has said here it is definitely

210
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,360
a an additive to a more you know kinetic

211
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,300
ability that can make more effects in in

212
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,339
the more traditional sense over time

213
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,519
than we saw these groups lessen their

214
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,620
wiper you know deployments they didn't

215
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,200
stop but they were definitely running

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,980
into resistance creating hardening

217
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,360
um you know hardening networks the

218
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,459
ability of the ukrainians to get help

219
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,839
because they bind up Cloud

220
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,540
infrastructure and didn't just you know

221
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,519
continue with an on-prem approach which

222
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,220
it is very difficult to help anybody if

223
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,040
you rely on very old thinking like I

224
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,899
have to have a very closed system all

225
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,000
the time you cannot get help when you

226
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,060
need it if you're in that situation

227
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,380
so those are just some of the ways that

228
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,300
we have learned a lot from what the

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Russians are doing this is great insight

230
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,980
and obviously anybody that works for a

231
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
hyperscaler right now is a field day

232
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,760
because you really show that this really

233
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,040
helps organizations be more resilient

234
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,540
obviously if you have Cloud

235
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,800
infrastructure or partly Cloud

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
infrastructure now Alex you work for

237
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,140
Albus right and Airbus is also

238
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,839
protecting the European Commission in a

239
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,880
big framework agreement you protect many

240
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,220
other companies your yourself critical

241
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,440
infrastructure because you produce very

242
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
important aircraft and many other

243
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,120
Technologies what kind of activities did

244
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,519
You observe and in your end in the cyber

245
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,800
security space days with regards to the

246
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
networks that you protect the different

247
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,000
organizations

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,279
thank you yeah effectively Airbus is uh

249
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,740
is protecting both the civilian let's

250
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,940
say European

251
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,519
and defense and we see uh we see

252
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,820
interesting Trends I would say on on the

253
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,580
various uh um uh profiles of our

254
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,800
customer on the civilian Market

255
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,200
um what we notice is that we have more

256
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,640
and more cyber attacks because because

257
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
you have on the dark web also much

258
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,380
easier access to cyber weapons right so

259
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,660
it's the the entry barriers are much

260
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,480
lower however these attacks may be uh

261
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,300
less impactful

262
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,700
and less dangerous let's say in the the

263
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
number however it takes time and energy

264
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,500
to to protect the cnis the institutions

265
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,660
which are being attacked

266
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,260
um

267
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,079
what we see however as in the military

268
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,800
area is that there's a completely

269
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,839
different

270
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,060
mindset of course in the two in the two

271
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,980
um

272
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,300
segments and I would say that our

273
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,459
military

274
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,200
customers are much much more prepared

275
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,180
because they are

276
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,640
um training regularly and this is

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,140
something that they are used to do so

278
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,300
they really take a full week or longer

279
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,880
and train go through the the food

280
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
exercise and this is something maybe the

281
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
commercial Market could could learn

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,120
about on the other hand on the civilian

283
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
part we have much more CTI because they

284
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,420
are much more events happening and I

285
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,120
believe sharing more of this experience

286
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,820
between the two worlds would bring much

287
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,680
more Advantage also to the military and

288
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,140
Military world as well

289
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,660
okay now Robert you're sort of like the

290
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,540
cyber security poster chat a little bit

291
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,459
of the German Armed Forces because you

292
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,860
can talk very very deep technology and

293
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,779
cyber security aspects I would say

294
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,760
because you're all over Germany all the

295
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,800
time and of course you're also active at

296
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,440
NATO and if anybody wants to even

297
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,959
discuss code I think they could do it

298
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,339
with you

299
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,779
um so I think you're the right person

300
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,399
here for the panel

301
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,860
um I'm wondering um where do you see the

302
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,079
the limits in terms of the military

303
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,720
capabilities to protect

304
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,240
um the cyberspace and the the classical

305
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,100
organizations that are not in the

306
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,320
military space

307
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,180
they usually protect via air defense and

308
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,240
so on we're at the limits right now

309
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,000
um legal and capacity of course we have

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,120
legal barriers what we are allowed to do

311
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,120
and what has to be done by the civilian

312
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,540
board and um I think that's fine

313
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,220
um because we

314
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,380
um even if we would be allowed to do

315
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,019
more we don't have the capacity right so

316
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,639
if you're talking for example about a

317
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,519
conflict and now um we have to do some

318
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,920
protection of the great civilian

319
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,320
infrastructure that are highly complex

320
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,480
systems so it wouldn't be possible to

321
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,240
bring just military teams of experts

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,540
into the location and expect they are

323
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,100
able to run the system and protect the

324
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,260
system that's not possible so everybody

325
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,279
has to do on the um the thing they are

326
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,200
responsible for but we definitely have

327
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,660
to improve the exercising together and

328
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,959
the exchange of information too much to

329
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,000
make these much more easier and smoother

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,399
so exercising in the military

331
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,680
um is is a keen thing and we are very

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,720
good with that we have for example

333
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,899
events like Luke X where we do that

334
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,360
together but I think we need more of

335
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
these events and

336
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,320
um yeah also going deeper and not only

337
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,079
having paper exercises

338
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,180
okay then a follow-up question maybe

339
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,579
Mika and Sandra when you started

340
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,860
protecting or helping Ukraine did you

341
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,800
see any of the big European players

342
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,920
supporting it or was it mostly American

343
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,800
companies that are active in cyber that

344
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,760
that protect helped protect Ukraine so

345
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,820
honestly speaking first of all I I would

346
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,920
say the ukrainians asked for a lot of

347
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,600
help from a lot of people and I think

348
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,920
one of the challenges in the Cyber

349
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,180
domain is that there's no perfect

350
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,399
visibility of exactly what happened in

351
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,620
this I know from the defense department

352
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,839
perspective we have been very active in

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,320
providing them a wide range of support

354
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,600
um but coming back to this question on

355
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,579
what the roles and responsibilities are

356
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,100
this is real is relevant to the Ukraine

357
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,899
question one of the things that we in

358
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,360
the Department of Defense have realized

359
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,240
as part of our authorities to operate

360
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,360
outside of our territory is that we are

361
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,220
able to do a number of things that are

362
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,019
very helpful for cyber defense because

363
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,959
we are never going to be able to

364
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,579
have the capacity nor do we have the

365
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,620
authority to operate those networks

366
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,680
inside but one of the things that we can

367
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,980
or the things that we can do include

368
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,139
generating insights about adversary

369
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,360
malicious activity and sharing them with

370
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,480
the private sector with other countries

371
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,360
with ukrainians and as I think everyone

372
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,220
is aware we generated insights not just

373
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,500
about malicious cyber activity but

374
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,420
malicious intention from the Russians

375
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,980
generally and shared that out with the

376
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,060
world

377
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,639
um and that is a philosophical change

378
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,399
for us about being able to not only

379
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,920
collect that but to share that and we

380
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,940
have found that we can share that

381
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,760
without risking our ability to generate

382
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,339
further insights and then the other

383
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,779
thing that we can do and this goes to

384
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,040
this question of offensive cyber

385
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,899
capability is that we can try and

386
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,540
degrade attacks that may be coming

387
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,779
before they reach the territory and so

388
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,100
you know there have been a lot of

389
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,019
conversation about hackback and who

390
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,160
should do that

391
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,639
if you think about international law

392
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,660
states have responsibility to for uh

393
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,660
outbound offensive power generally

394
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,240
States right do not allow people to

395
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
project military power from their own

396
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
territory that is not sanctioned by the

397
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,220
state in the Cyber domain it's a little

398
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,839
bit more challenging because there are

399
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,399
cyber non-state cyber actors who can

400
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,920
project that capability from territory

401
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,860
perhaps even unknown to a state but

402
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,540
States generally have that

403
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,440
responsibility to take uh for what comes

404
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,860
out of their territory and if a state

405
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,079
um you want to make sure that because of

406
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,019
potential escalation risk so States I

407
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,100
think have to look at that and think

408
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
about what they're doing and so

409
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,940
I don't think that we would want the

410
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,740
private sector to be in the position of

411
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,139
going extraterritorially to disrupt on

412
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,060
networks that they do not own or operate

413
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,740
they they don't they don't have the

414
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,300
permission to do that

415
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,399
um but can but the question is should

416
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,139
governments and in certain cases there

417
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,399
may be

418
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,440
um as our previous speakers have talked

419
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,699
about a little bit

420
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,440
um governments may have that ability to

421
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
do that in ways that are consistent with

422
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,220
State responsibility

423
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,440
okay now Sandra you you're doing a lot

424
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,019
of red teaming right also on the defense

425
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,279
industrial base

426
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,500
do you are you concerned about what

427
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,660
you're finding there or do you would you

428
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,299
say the defense industrial base plus a

429
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,400
lot of players in defense

430
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,079
are in a good position from a defense

431
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,059
perspective well we usually say a

432
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,740
spoiler alert when we do that is we

433
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
always get in when we're doing a red

434
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,319
team and that's because what we do is we

435
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,260
emulate the newest novel techniques that

436
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,980
we're seeing most of which have not been

437
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,799
patched or have not been recognized yet

438
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,720
and that's really demonstrative of of

439
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,600
the the movable Target that is this

440
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,340
threat actor when they continue to do

441
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,160
this we've seen I wouldn't say it's a a

442
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,020
government specific or or commercial

443
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,200
specific problem we you know

444
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,059
organizations are doing everything they

445
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,400
can they are getting better but we

446
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,640
always get in and the reason is that

447
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,700
um the uh it is always going to be

448
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,740
easier for somebody who is trying to

449
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,380
find a one small vulnerability in a very

450
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,480
large Network or set of networks

451
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,559
depending on the size of the

452
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,840
organization than it is to you know

453
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,780
defend against all of that the important

454
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,580
part I think is in that sort of that

455
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,700
scope of resilience while we respond to

456
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,400
over a thousand breaches a year

457
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
um the vast majority of these

458
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,539
organizations eventually are up and

459
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,160
running again and continue to do the

460
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,500
business of that they need to do so we

461
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,179
have learned to be resilient I think as

462
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,760
a society we we don't want that initial

463
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,740
breach to happen but when it does it's

464
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,480
about how quickly can you get back

465
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,760
online how quickly can you get ahead of

466
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
it of the next time and how can you

467
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,100
adjust your defenses so that you're in a

468
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,960
better position the next round

469
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,000
and then speaking of resilience and

470
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,940
showing up defenses Mika you served or

471
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,799
supported members of Congress on the

472
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,880
intelligence and armed services

473
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,580
committees did you see in terms of

474
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,400
budgetary processes and also procurement

475
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,919
afterwards that cyber over the last

476
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,539
couple of years became more prominent

477
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,120
and you're using basically your power of

478
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,740
procurement and all these things to

479
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,020
improve the situation in cyber I mean

480
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,360
from worship to the organizations that

481
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,179
built the worship yeah

482
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,440
um having spent a lot of time working

483
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,820
for members of Congress I will say that

484
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,460
in many ways the members of Congress

485
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,080
um

486
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,260
were I think quicker to recognize and

487
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,539
try and push action

488
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,580
um and governmental reorganization and

489
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,140
structures like that then the executive

490
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,000
branch was itself and you see that in

491
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,559
Congress creating the national cyber

492
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,539
director and a lot of the reporting

493
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,679
requirements that are passed by

494
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,900
legislation so in some ways the

495
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,860
legislature in the U.S has been I think

496
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,820
um

497
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,480
much more forward-leaning in how to

498
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,820
address cyber and to try and get at some

499
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,860
of these um I think cross-cutting

500
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,539
problems because the members of Congress

501
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,100
themselves sit on multiple committees

502
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,679
and so they can see this challenge

503
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,640
evolving from not just armed services

504
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,799
but also from Homeland Security or

505
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,380
Commerce or all these other places so

506
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,340
um

507
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,400
that I think has been you know there

508
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,700
sort of our our um

509
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,140
I don't know what the right phrases for

510
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,220
that but they have been I think really

511
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,840
driving that change part of the

512
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,460
challenge though is that there are many

513
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,140
of them and there are lots of ideas and

514
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,000
they don't always have full visibility

515
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,299
on how things are done so sometimes

516
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,440
there are challenges in sort of

517
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,500
implementing the idea that they have had

518
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,240
um but generally speaking I think our

519
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,919
members of Congress in part I think

520
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,299
because I think they talk to Industry

521
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,220
far more frequently

522
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,280
um have been

523
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,419
forward-leaning on this and you see that

524
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,380
in the solarium commission

525
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,179
recommendations in other places

526
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,600
okay and this trend of you know joined

527
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,179
all domain command control

528
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,280
um do you think in terms of sharing both

529
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,559
within the us as well as maybe among

530
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,160
Coalition Partners required oh sorry

531
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,880
um

532
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,039
I'm repeating my question so do you

533
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,780
think there's this new

534
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,179
um well objective or a strategy of joint

535
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,340
all domain command control

536
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,020
um is that

537
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,620
create or enlarging the attack surface

538
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,080
quite significantly because of course

539
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,419
you want to use it among all the

540
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,280
different branches of the military as

541
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,860
well as among the Allies is do you are

542
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,120
you concerned a little bit about that

543
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,640
and um yeah or do you think technology

544
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,679
will find a way and what it needs to be

545
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,020
concerned so I think one should never

546
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,840
not be concerned about an attack surface

547
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,820
I do think one of my colleagues said to

548
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,799
me uh joint all domain command and

549
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,620
control Jad C2 for short is not a noun

550
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,080
it's a verb it is not a program of

551
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,659
record it is a thing that we must do for

552
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,580
a modern military for a modern military

553
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,440
to be able to integrate across all of

554
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,000
the services air sea land cyber space we

555
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,740
have to be able to bring all of those

556
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,620
things together and operate them in an

557
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,760
integrated fashion so how we do that is

558
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,039
something that we are working through

559
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,559
and it is not about having a single

560
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,640
platform that presents this

561
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,020
vulnerability across all of it where

562
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,580
someone can hack in and like take

563
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,200
control of the United States military it

564
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,900
is a thing that we must do but I think

565
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,360
the attack surface and the vulnerability

566
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,580
comes from the fact that we are a modern

567
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,120
military acting in a coordinated way in

568
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,159
an alliance with other modern militaries

569
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,760
that are more vulnerable to that kind of

570
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,860
attack back than a military that hasn't

571
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,980
upgraded itself and is still operating

572
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,679
on Hydraulics and things like that so

573
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,020
it is I think the cost of doing business

574
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,679
to be able to operate in this way but it

575
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,760
is certainly something that we have to

576
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,620
pay a lot of attention to to make sure

577
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,860
that every layer of that system from

578
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,020
data all the way through right data

579
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,419
common operational pictures fires all

580
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,760
the rest of that that we are thinking

581
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,840
about security as we as we connect

582
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,940
um now you know going over the punt to

583
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,080
Europe

584
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
um we have similar discussions over here

585
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,820
in Europe not only collaborating among

586
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,980
the militaries with the NATO or within

587
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,659
Europe but also of course civil military

588
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,659
cooperation

589
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,640
do we have the right technology in

590
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,980
Europe to do that or and is there

591
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,840
actually a market you know picking up on

592
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,940
what we heard earlier from commissioners

593
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,740
freenas

594
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,539
yeah I'm I have to say I'm quite jealous

595
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,159
listening to you because you speak with

596
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,260
one voice right and you have one One

597
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,960
Direction in um in Europe it's not the

598
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,320
case uh yet and I think one consequence

599
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,740
of the the Ukraine war for us in Europe

600
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,480
is that cyber

601
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,900
as maybe the rest but saibo as well is

602
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,559
um

603
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,140
getting even more Sovereign than than it

604
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,960
was before and Sovereign at the state

605
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,340
level so we are a bit uh in in Europe

606
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,500
being very much Europe focused and oh

607
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,179
sorry Nation focused and then there's a

608
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,400
NATO level and we're a bit uh let's say

609
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,260
forgetting Europe in the middle which is

610
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,720
a I think a missed opportunity for for

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,000
us to be stronger and to build up

612
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,280
European Technologies

613
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,100
um because this means

614
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,260
um having European Champion right the

615
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,320
National Market is too too small uh on

616
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,720
on this on this type of of Technologies

617
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,580
so building up strong European Champions

618
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,880
investing together in a direction

619
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,440
in r d massively and um and be be

620
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,260
reliable let's say on on the roadmap and

621
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,620
the vision we have as a as a continent

622
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,960
today we do have some some national

623
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,740
champions We do have them

624
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,260
um but there are they are not strong

625
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,260
enough yet and uh and of course Europe

626
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,980
is uh needs to uh the support of its

627
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,200
allies uh of course

628
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,419
um uh it's not only the case for cyber

629
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
it's the case for for let's say the

630
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,059
Europe of defense and uh maybe one day

631
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,520
we'll go further in the the European

632
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,980
Union Creation with having a real uh

633
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,840
common uh common defense to be able to

634
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,820
speak with one voice I think during the

635
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,679
war of Ukraine we are we've been quite

636
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,059
good in coordinating and uh and um

637
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,940
let's say acting together but if we if

638
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,799
we want to be stronger as you said you

639
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,919
need to be ready up front

640
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,200
and and for that you need years of

641
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,640
investment

642
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,820
um let's say uh investing in some key

643
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,299
Technologies for for the sake of the

644
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,340
European sovereignty in the end

645
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,279
okay and and Robert the military has

646
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,020
always been quite concerned about using

647
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,779
the right technology right and highly

648
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,140
secure products to enable digitization

649
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,120
um but it's maybe you could talk a

650
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,460
little bit about that it's it's a quite

651
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,520
a complex process right and it might

652
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,740
take years so the question is what could

653
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,779
we how could we improve that process of

654
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,179
evaluation and approval and common

655
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,039
recognition

656
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,000
um that sometimes takes years and years

657
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
um that's an interesting one um and I

658
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,140
realized in the states there are some

659
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,620
studies about the negative effects of

660
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,500
having standardized certified products

661
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,380
because yeah you um freeze to one point

662
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,720
in time then you do all the analysis and

663
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,440
you have even failures and um

664
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
vulnerabilities in between and are not

665
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,500
able to close that because the

666
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,140
certification is gone so um that's a

667
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,640
little bit challenging

668
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,720
um I think we have to look into the um

669
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,559
in the system landscape itself and make

670
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,020
a differentiation about the different

671
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,480
layers and products so for example if

672
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
you have let's say a communication

673
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,820
device a core router or something like

674
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,480
that then if it's built on a trustworthy

675
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,120
base verified code and things like that

676
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,460
it may be possible that you ran it for

677
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,039
years and years without any negative

678
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,440
conflict and consequences but if you

679
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,559
have a look at equipment for the

680
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,880
Warfighter that must be

681
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,919
updated on a faster page that needs new

682
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,960
functionality and things like that then

683
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,820
these processes are definitely not fast

684
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,039
enough to to realize that at the moment

685
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,340
so um we have some new certifications

686
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,320
for example in the EU we have new

687
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,539
processes to shorten that because a lot

688
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,520
of the delays is huge amount of

689
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,760
paperwork that has to be done we have

690
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,860
chances to improve these processes by

691
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,559
for example doing more analysis with

692
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,919
machine learning based techniques and

693
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:41,659
everything

694
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,980
automated penetration testing things

695
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,260
like that so there are opportunities to

696
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,779
improve these processes but I think

697
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,480
there's still quite a lot a long way to

698
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,059
go at the moment okay you gave a nice

699
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,059
word there certification we can you know

700
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:57,720
what's

701
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,279
coming

702
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,320
um just to briefly touch up on it I know

703
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,820
this was done in the previous

704
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,340
administration and it started in your

705
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,580
past but I still don't want to want to

706
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,720
bring it up because some people here

707
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,460
might not be aware of it

708
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,380
um I think there's an initiative from

709
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,559
the dod DHS is also involved and so on

710
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,140
to in improve the cyber security posture

711
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,600
of the defense industrial base it's like

712
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
what three hundred thousand

713
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,360
companies small and big from the big

714
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,539
lock it might into some tiny

715
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,700
minority owned we buy a lot of things we

716
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,900
buy a lot of things you buy a lot of

717
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,940
things and some of them of course

718
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,039
um are companies that are not residing

719
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,039
in the US so um that's a certification

720
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,500
with a lot of let's say

721
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,659
lack of clarity for a lot of players

722
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,240
that that are potentially affected

723
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
um that is only also tying into the nist

724
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
standard so any any thoughts about that

725
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,000
and any developments you see at the I

726
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,880
think the cyber security of the defense

727
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
supply chain is a very big concern and

728
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,880
we want to make sure that suppliers are

729
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,820
meeting their obligations to us to run

730
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,620
secure Enterprises as they're building

731
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,659
things so that we do not see the

732
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,700
intellectual property stolen so that

733
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,559
adversaries know how to what the

734
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,000
vulnerabilities are of our systems and

735
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,860
things like that and so it helps to have

736
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,380
a standard uh against which people are

737
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,679
measuring their cyber security maturity

738
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,659
and so we are have adopted the nist

739
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:28,860
standard and there's the cyber security

740
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,919
maturity model the challenge has been

741
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,779
people make representations to us about

742
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,000
how good they are at their compliance

743
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,760
but we don't have uh have not had a lot

744
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,980
of ability to verify that they are doing

745
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,980
that except for in those instances post

746
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,039
breach where we have discovered that

747
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,779
they are not living up to their

748
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,340
requirements so how do we try and

749
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,799
prevent that from happening so this uh

750
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,200
process the compliance piece of this is

751
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,480
going through a notice and comment

752
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,159
rulemaking in the United States which is

753
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,080
very bureaucratic and quite long quite

754
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,299
lengthy but it is our hope that after

755
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,919
that is published that that will provide

756
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,299
some clarity to people who are

757
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,159
participating in the U.S defense supply

758
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,440
chain about what their obligations are

759
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,299
to secure their own networks when they

760
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,039
are selling things to the United States

761
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,380
government okay but there are no

762
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,720
conversations yet as the speaker said

763
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,360
between the years on this topic it seems

764
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,279
um to work yeah I think that we have a

765
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,140
lot of side conversations about this and

766
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,399
I think it is a really important

767
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,120
question about how we can try and create

768
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,620
equivalencies between U.S models and

769
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,620
other models but I think we as we're

770
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,000
still trying to get our own house in

771
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,740
order I don't know how far along we are

772
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,200
and in terms of that reciprocity okay

773
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,720
now Alex do you think

774
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,580
we are in a good spot there in Europe

775
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,440
with regards I mean obviously you're

776
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,480
well connected among the defense

777
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,640
contractor Community as as one of the

778
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,500
biggest or probably the biggest player

779
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,640
in Europe

780
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,380
um do you think we we're in a good spot

781
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,720
there in terms of cyber defense cyber

782
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,299
posture and resiliency

783
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,360
I think things are moving I think the

784
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,580
the status is is a is different from one

785
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,039
country to another and there are clearly

786
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,720
acknowledgments that things needs to

787
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,820
move some countries are very clear on

788
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,620
their doctrines and what they want to do

789
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,200
and which direction they are following

790
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,620
which which Investments the place and

791
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,419
and the ambition

792
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,760
I think we've seen

793
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,679
um some new initiatives also bringing

794
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,000
all the Cyber commanders of Europe

795
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,299
together to try to align on this uh

796
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,600
um typically cyber defense topics so so

797
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
again here trying to bring everyone uh

798
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,779
to the table and to progress to progress

799
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,159
together

800
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,840
um however coming back to what you said

801
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,120
a bit at the beginning on the the Walk

802
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,039
of Ukraine what we see as well that the

803
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,279
war of Ukraine has not been a cyberpower

804
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,620
so the uh the consequence of that has

805
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,740
been that Investments also have been not

806
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,340
obligatory directed to the Cyber domain

807
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,200
as well right yeah I think and I think

808
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,179
that that is actually a mistake that if

809
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,580
people take from this conflict that

810
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,340
cyber was not as impactful as they had

811
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,460
expected they'd miss the great volume of

812
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,720
cyber activity that is actually

813
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,399
occurring right now and if that means

814
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,559
that they that leads them to under

815
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,440
invest in cyber then all the resiliency

816
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,360
lessons all the Preparatory lessons that

817
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,600
Ukraine has learned are lost and it we

818
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,980
don't I don't think we want to make that

819
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,919
mistake but I think because it paled in

820
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,240
comparison does not mean it didn't

821
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,799
happen we still need to invest in this

822
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,760
area

823
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,399
yeah yeah fully agreed and I wanted to

824
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,620
just jump in on on this so somebody

825
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,360
asked me yesterday

826
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,059
um what is the difference between U.S

827
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:46,860
narratives around cyber security and

828
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,779
European ones and I said when you're in

829
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,600
the U.S The Narrative and the tone about

830
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,399
cyber security is it's about National

831
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,799
Security it's about bad threat actors

832
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,720
doing bad things to good people or

833
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,820
networks right it's it's very much in

834
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,740
that tone when you come to Europe and

835
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,360
I'm generalizing of course because it's

836
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,760
a generalizing kind of question then the

837
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,440
the conversation switches to

838
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,260
standardization privacy concerns more of

839
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,260
that type of of you know regulation and

840
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,519
and

841
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,179
um

842
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,919
I think they're two sides of the same

843
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,700
coin we need both but I just wanted as

844
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,679
you know an incident response company

845
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,960
and threat intelligence company we

846
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,700
respond to breaches that so-called

847
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,000
compliant companies almost every day

848
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,220
so you can't have

849
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,159
um a one without the other is what I'm

850
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,360
trying to say

851
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,559
okay

852
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,240
it's it's an interesting thing because I

853
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,419
read in the news that um I think the the

854
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,399
Cyber Commander for for the Navy said

855
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,720
well it's great that we have all these

856
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,399
compliance standards and we can do a

857
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,620
check check mark there but in the

858
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,380
reality life looks very different but um

859
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,480
I briefly want to say go back to Robert

860
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
about capabilities and capacity because

861
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,039
obviously you know there are certain

862
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,960
products and processes and so on but of

863
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,700
course as we all heard earlier today

864
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,380
it's also with the people right and

865
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,418
um I think yesterday or this morning I

866
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,820
read something that the German Armed

867
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,320
Forces also have a challenge like

868
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,480
everyone else to find the people Sheena

869
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,418
said it everyone always tells to him I

870
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,280
don't have the peoples and of course we

871
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,679
all know that in cyber it's a ginormous

872
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,820
skills Gap so how how are you trying to

873
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,280
to win over talent in this super

874
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,260
contested field especially for the Armed

875
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,599
Forces I mean people at least they

876
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,679
probably don't have to go to the front

877
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,719
lines that's a and it's warm so that's a

878
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,719
cool thing but I don't know

879
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,580
um well I think the challenges are

880
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,159
everywhere the same and from my point of

881
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,940
view

882
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,040
um the forces don't have bigger

883
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,960
challenges than than other

884
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,339
um areas

885
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,800
um we have the very good opportunity

886
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,619
that we have a very good ecosystem at

887
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,480
for example at the University of the

888
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,220
federal Armed Forces we build up our

889
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,980
research uh send their code and we have

890
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,859
a 13 professorships only dealing with

891
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,020
different aspects of cyber so that's a

892
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,060
unique thing right we invested a lot of

893
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,339
money over the years and we have a lot

894
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,680
of additional opportunities in the

895
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,579
forces to do our own education to bring

896
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:20,160
the people to the right level and also

897
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,160
by the right industrial courses for from

898
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,040
science and other important things so um

899
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,260
I think we are really doing uh the best

900
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,260
we can we can be better in the

901
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,900
communication of what we are doing

902
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,480
that's my point of view too often

903
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,780
um there there's the talking about their

904
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,880
money and things like that if you do the

905
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,820
whole calculation it's not so much more

906
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,040
what you can earn in the industry and

907
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,300
you have a very interesting work

908
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,280
environment it's not uh perfect

909
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,380
definitely not we have a lot of

910
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,859
challenges with having if we want to

911
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,900
promote people to set them to different

912
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,720
fields to build up expertise in

913
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,420
different areas we are improving on that

914
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,640
changed the way the system is working

915
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,560
for the Specialists so they don't have

916
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,040
to go out of the field in case and can

917
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,880
stay in the same area so I think these

918
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,099
things are very good and the missing

919
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,520
part is a realistic communication to the

920
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,800
outside what's really going on on the

921
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,980
forces because we had some interesting

922
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,420
advertisements a couple of years ago

923
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,760
where yeah someone is standing at the

924
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,099
laptop and yet you're building a

925
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,020
firewall around the ship and these

926
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,839
things so um yeah you can communicate

927
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,359
that that way but at least if I finally

928
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,280
we are still soldiers and everybody even

929
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,500
the Cyber expert must be able to do the

930
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,099
March and if it's necessary go to the

931
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,400
mission so giving a more broader

932
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,980
realistic picture is all we can do and I

933
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,619
think the rest is is quite fine and we

934
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,720
need just a better outside communication

935
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,060
okay Mickey do you want to say something

936
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,579
otherwise Sandra told me and we have

937
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,460
four four minutes and 13 seconds left we

938
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,040
haven't done it so far if somebody in

939
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,079
the room or in the other room has a

940
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,460
question I would say we could at least

941
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,800
take one or two questions if we have a

942
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,520
beanie short super answer but Sandra

943
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,140
well

944
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,060
um so for the workforce shortage I just

945
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,680
want to say something that I don't think

946
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,560
is often remarked on which is

947
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,440
um if you have looked at any point on

948
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,359
the workflow of a security operations

949
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,820
center you know employee where I really

950
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,920
looked at the Investments or lack of

951
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,200
investments in people that do the

952
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,359
security work on the Cyber front lines

953
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,579
they're still doing very Antiquated

954
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,700
clunky things like copy pasting into

955
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,099
Excel spreadsheets they are you know we

956
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,440
put in a lot of money into you know

957
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,680
email endpoint Network defenses but when

958
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,560
it comes to actually

959
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,300
streamlining the work that our Security

960
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,820
Professionals do we've left them in the

961
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,700
Lurch so a lot of times they say we love

962
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,040
the mission and we hate our jobs because

963
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,220
it's so clunky the workforce shortage if

964
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,020
we could make their job more efficient

965
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,240
if we could invest in their workflows

966
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,820
maybe the workforce shortage would be

967
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,460
less about hiring 20 people to work in

968
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,640
Excel spreadsheets and two people but

969
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,800
with clean systems that work very

970
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,900
efficiently

971
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,820
really interesting um I'm just curious

972
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,579
how many people here have experience in

973
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,140
your armed forces or are recruiting

974
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,760
people out of the Armed Forces into

975
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,359
cyber security

976
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,560
this is one of the things where when we

977
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,180
think about Workforce shortages I think

978
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,560
about this a lot from the perspective of

979
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,839
the Department of Defense because we

980
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,359
have a very hard time every day keeping

981
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,660
our people against the very generous job

982
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,720
offers that companies here are making to

983
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,060
them

984
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,560
and so but I think that we have to

985
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,320
accept that as a fact of life that the

986
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,200
military training of cyber Security

987
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,980
Professionals is a pipeline into this

988
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,200
industry and so as we think about and

989
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,700
we're going through a process right now

990
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,859
of rethinking how we taking a look at

991
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,720
and thinking about how we do our fourth

992
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,700
generation model we have to think about

993
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,000
how is it that our people flow out into

994
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,880
this private sector industry but also is

995
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,040
there a way perhaps by using our Reserve

996
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,740
component model of sharing Talent

997
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,900
between the private sector and the

998
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,760
government because I think we are all

999
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,260
struggling from with this challenge of

1000
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,680
like Workforce but if we can push more

1001
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,960
people through our system we can help

1002
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,940
provide more trained Personnel who are

1003
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,200
good at looking at threat intelligence

1004
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,520
who are good at understanding and

1005
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,320
Building Systems back into the private

1006
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,980
sector

1007
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,359
I think this is why we're also very

1008
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,520
curious about the initiative of the

1009
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,619
European commission when it comes to you

1010
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,780
know creating that Workforce any

1011
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,540
question here okay

1012
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,380
sir please

1013
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,540
uh any criminals cyber criminals being

1014
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,300
caught and Justified of puts Justice is

1015
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,380
it not being done to

1016
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,460
yeah it's a it's a really important

1017
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,839
question I appreciate that because I

1018
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,060
think two pieces to that one is I think

1019
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,140
when we think about systems being

1020
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,760
compromised there's a distinction

1021
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,680
between I think intelligence collection

1022
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,500
and disruption and luckily we see fewer

1023
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,480
stories about disruption of systems than

1024
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,700
we do see about information compromise

1025
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,020
of systems

1026
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,780
um but I would say one of the things

1027
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,160
that we have started doing in the

1028
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,720
Department of Defense is trying to help

1029
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,880
our law enforcement colleagues who are

1030
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,579
doing more and so I just came here from

1031
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,400
Paris and Munich it was very cruel of

1032
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,480
you to break paris's heart on

1033
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,079
Valentine's Day

1034
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,520
um but uh

1035
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,099
the

1036
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:58,079
there they were talking about a combined

1037
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,180
operation between the United States and

1038
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,980
Europe poll to to do some disruption

1039
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,200
Against The Hive ransomware group so I

1040
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,280
think there are these disruptions

1041
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,020
happening but because it's very

1042
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,880
complicated it crosses multiple

1043
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,040
jurisdictions I think collectively we

1044
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,020
have to get better at being able to

1045
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,420
share the intelligence that we need

1046
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,619
prosecutors across the world and I think

1047
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,720
we have a panel uh coming up later on

1048
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,619
this

1049
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,540
um I need to get better on this but I

1050
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,520
think that we do need to impose

1051
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,480
consequences on that because it's my

1052
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,240
belief that the malicious actors like

1053
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,220
the rest of us have a Workforce problem

1054
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,200
there are only so many people who can do

1055
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,000
this work so if we can impose

1056
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,740
consequences on the people who do this

1057
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,619
work it significantly degrades the

1058
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,660
amount of malicious activity that we

1059
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,900
will see and be victimized by

1060
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,420
like this was an on point great closing

1061
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,820
statement I think we can applaud to that

1062
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,610
um because

1063
00:41:51,610 --> 00:42:00,800
[Applause]
