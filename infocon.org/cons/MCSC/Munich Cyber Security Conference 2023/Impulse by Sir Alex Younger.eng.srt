[Music]

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,680
thank you very much and it is uh it is

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,039
great to be here normally when I'm at

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,500
the MSC I'm laid and down with

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,840
responsibility and now I'm free to tell

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,359
you exactly what I think

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,420
up to a point

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,719
um I don't pretend to the wisdom that

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,540
many of you have here but I I can lay

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,379
claim I think to a distinct experience

12
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:42,840
which is while during the last 30 years

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,420
you all thought that history had ended

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,059
and we were in the post-modern phase and

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,640
that uh geopolitical rivalry was a thing

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,399
of the past I was in the bit where that

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,280
just wasn't true and history hadn't

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,160
ended and the type of stuff you're

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,680
experiencing now was our everyday so I

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,019
thought I would just try and share a bit

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,420
of that experience because that's the

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,240
background to the problem we're here to

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,100
discuss

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,840
um we haven't known each other for long

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,860
but I I want to share one of the biggest

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,820
disappointments of my life

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,799
and that is that it turns out contrary

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,619
to our expectations that the internet is

29
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,920
not necessarily on our side we thought

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,460
it was we invented it uh we thought

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,920
dictators would have big trouble with

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,860
the democratization of information

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,619
it turns out tragically on the contrary

34
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,200
that this technology can be bent to the

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,220
purposes of self of um of societal

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,479
control

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
and might even net out to the benefit of

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
authoritarians at the expense of

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,860
democracy and when I think about the

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,720
choices my children will have in the

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
future to my mind they're dictated by

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,180
two things one whether we get our act

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,420
together on the climate and the other is

44
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,639
which value system is the default

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,700
setting for our digital world

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,819
and it doesn't come any bigger than that

47
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,459
and these value whilst we uh seek to do

48
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,720
it in different ways we must understand

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,360
that this is systemic there's a top-down

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
version of the internet and a bottom-up

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
version and they uh if you're an

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,540
autocracy you can only have the top down

53
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,620
version

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,599
and then for a democracy you can only

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,400
have the bottom up and you need to tell

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,620
me I don't know how these things can be

57
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,900
reconciled but it's the context of what

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,540
we're talking about to do and it means

59
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,920
that the challenge we face is much

60
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,760
larger than cyber security it's about

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,739
who owns the default digital Commons

62
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,959
it's about our relative capacity to

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,160
innovate as compared to our potential

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,360
opponents it's about who writes the

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,620
rules the boring issue of standards

66
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,060
but of course

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,980
given that the future of great power

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,980
rivalry or value system competition is

69
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,239
going to be around technology

70
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,959
comes in cyber as um as the field of the

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,459
front line and that is what it felt like

72
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,500
when I was in office

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,300
cyber is a big problem if you Define

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,140
Cyber as exploitation of faults in the

75
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,840
digital ecosystem which is what it is if

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,920
you look at the way the digital

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,040
ecosystem is growing clearly cyber is

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
going to grow as an issue

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,459
proportionately

80
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,580
but just to put it into perspective for

81
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,140
a moment

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,879
first of all I don't think we should be

83
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,400
catastrophizing this

84
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,060
um

85
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,360
we focus a lot on Cyber itot making

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,540
things go bang that is indeed a problem

87
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,700
ask me what the biggest damage calls to

88
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,760
our society is so far is the drip drip

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,459
loss of our IP and our strategic

90
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,580
advantage over time because we don't

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,200
even understand the value of the

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,220
information

93
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,019
that we possess

94
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,780
and also we can see some of the edges of

95
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,840
the usefulness of cyber turns out if

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,700
you're Putin and you want to close down

97
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,159
the Ukrainian electric grid a classic

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,100
network attack problem it seems to be

99
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,459
easier if not cheaper to drop an Iranian

100
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,460
drone onto a transmission station

101
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,199
so something about this being a creature

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,540
of of the hybrid more than the kinetic

103
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,139
war that I think is interesting

104
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,180
so when it comes to talking about what

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,740
it's like to operate in this space from

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,479
our national security perspective I I'm

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,520
not going to talk about what we do

108
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
particularly but I would certainly very

109
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,960
much like to talk about how we do it

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,020
and the first aspect which is what

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,000
you're talking about today is of course

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,940
teamwork and for a bureaucrat like me

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,400
it's just a horror cyber because it cuts

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,380
across all of the boundaries all of the

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,060
organizing principles the difference

116
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,340
between peace and War are the difference

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,620
between domestic and international all

118
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
goes and what the Russians taught us

119
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,639
really early with the godassimov

120
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,740
doctrine and the hybrid war was that if

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,240
you can get over that

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,460
and use that connectivity to affect

123
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,800
you'll be stronger and the challenge for

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,139
us is to organize for effect

125
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,720
I need to be honest with you as we

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,580
sought to concert our capabilities

127
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,880
across government and internationally

128
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,820
this was the last thing we asked as soon

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,340
as you asked who was in charge it froze

130
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,280
the whole conversation

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,020
it was a nightmare now you need to ask

132
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,479
it it's a good question to ask but for

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,460
me I made sure it was a thing we asked

134
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,560
at the end not at the beginning

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,780
fundamentally this was a cultural issue

136
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,759
an understanding on everyone's part that

137
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,440
they were responsible and that they

138
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,460
needed to subordinate their

139
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,120
institutional or personal egos to the

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,220
task of making our society more

141
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,400
resilient and that's a leadership job

142
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,320
and if you've got a leader who doesn't

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,060
understand that then that question won't

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,979
get you very far I would um contend

145
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:05,759
um

146
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,000
and then there's Innovation and if I if

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,039
I was for a thing when I was the chief

148
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,660
of MI6

149
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,120
it was that technology would be more of

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,600
an asset to us than to our opponents we

151
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,840
invented it why not

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,819
um and uh for that that required us

153
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,360
fundamentally to innovate faster

154
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
and for that to happen there was bad

155
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
news for someone like me in charge of a

156
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,220
government Department

157
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,080
um hierarchies don't innovate lots of

158
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,940
you will be in charge of hierarchies and

159
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,259
you've just got to flatten them as

160
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,120
quickly as you possibly can because what

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,860
does a hierarchy do

162
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
essentially it separates

163
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,060
Knowledge from Power

164
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,500
and you get a whole load of people like

165
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,280
me in charge with the power

166
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,020
but you get a load of people on the

167
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,340
front line

168
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,139
who've got the knowledge but can't

169
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,720
operationalize it unless you let them

170
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,720
free and I'll come on in a minute to why

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,400
the West is going to win these various

172
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,220
conflicts and spoiler alert that is the

173
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,919
answer is you locate the knowledge and

174
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,500
the power at the edge and not in the

175
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,620
middle

176
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,840
now what what to do in the face of this

177
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
threat from a government perspective

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,919
I'll just tell you um a story when when

179
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,840
you're in the National Security Council

180
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,180
or whether wherever it is and you get

181
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,699
attacked in cyberspace as a country you

182
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,080
know what the politicians are going to

183
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,539
say they're going to say where is the

184
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,780
big red button that I can press to shoot

185
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,360
back right that's what they always ask

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,460
understandably I mean it's really

187
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,759
irritating when it happens and I always

188
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,560
had to explain that that isn't really a

189
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,419
red button but let's just quickly go

190
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,759
there the subject of offensive cyber

191
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,520
offense and defense as military people

192
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,280
will tell you are intrinsically bound up

193
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,740
with one another

194
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,419
uh most Western countries now have a

195
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,280
declared offensive cyber capability mine

196
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,020
included

197
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,520
but I have always been rather skeptical

198
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
about the concept of cyber deterrence

199
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,340
because it's not like nuclear war there

200
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,680
aren't binary actors there are multiple

201
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,860
actors an attribution of course is a

202
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,819
nightmare

203
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,220
so I've always tried to put people away

204
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,780
from that idea

205
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,199
but equally it has its place I know that

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,900
the ransomware attack problem has got

207
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,199
less since the American colleagues still

208
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,539
some of the ransom back from our evil I

209
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,219
thought that was great

210
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,740
and um I think Putin is in some way

211
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,659
deterred from widening out the Cyber

212
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,880
conflict as well

213
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,459
for the west and for our response I'm a

214
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,020
Believer in US doubling down on our

215
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,480
strengths uh we need to beat the

216
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,160
Russians not to be the Russians and

217
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
what's our ultimate strength it's

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
teamwork it's our capacity to Ally and

219
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,339
if government has a role it is to

220
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,620
concert teamwork

221
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,060
that's what we have to do there's some

222
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,800
quite prosec things we need to get

223
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
better at we need at least to agree the

224
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,779
rules amongst ourselves even if they're

225
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,940
not going to be agreed globally and we

226
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,040
need common attribution tradecraft we

227
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,420
need to agree when we're going to call

228
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,540
States out as Bad actors

229
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,240
but the most important thing is for us

230
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
to use our greatest strength

231
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,880
to be a distributed system

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,540
to bring to life the power of the public

233
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,820
and private working together

234
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,279
I think there's a real risk for

235
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,500
government in introducing moral hazard

236
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,200
pretending that they can sort it out

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,779
that actually immediately undermines the

238
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,720
solution to the whole problem I asked a

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
Chinese colleague who was going to win

240
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,399
this competition and surprisingly enough

241
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,260
he gave me a very Frank answer he said

242
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,880
we'll win anything that's centralized

243
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,580
and you'll win anything that's

244
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,279
decentralized so let's do that this is

245
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,320
all about us calling on the whole

246
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,899
panoply of capabilities that already

247
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,800
exist primarily in the private sector

248
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
um I I should reveal a loyalty I am a

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,820
board of on the board of recorded future

250
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,740
a digital intelligence organization

251
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,500
which absolutely knows where it stands

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
on this issue and possesses capabilities

253
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
that would have been The Preserve of

254
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,800
government only five years ago there are

255
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,380
many companies of that type and I think

256
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,080
the primary task for us is to concert

257
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,440
the genius that sits in this room to

258
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
affect so my suggestion

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,380
is that uh it's not really a question of

260
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,540
asking who's in charge it's a question

261
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,540
of asking who is responsible and the

262
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,420
answer to that is all of you

263
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,199
thank you

264
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,899
thank you
