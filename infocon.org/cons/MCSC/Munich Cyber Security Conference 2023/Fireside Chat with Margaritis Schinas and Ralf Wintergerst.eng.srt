1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,900
foreign

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:14,000
[Music]

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
mic test

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,600
so I think the Fireside is missing right

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,439
but the sun is outside and maybe to the

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,660
to the regime room we take the four

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,180
minutes from the previous panel

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,439
so almost to the day one year back we

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,239
were both opening the conference

10
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,280
I was doing the opening and you were

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,260
doing the first Keynote

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,260
and we took a picture afterwards we were

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,300
both smiling

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,120
eventually a week later the smile of our

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,399
faces disappeared right because then the

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,680
Russian invasion started into Ukraine

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,860
and I just wonder as we speak now again

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,140
whether your hopes and plans have been

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,239
nevertheless realized and I think that's

20
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,059
what we talked most about in our short

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,760
fireside chat but but maybe let's start

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,559
with a very simple question

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,840
it's the motto of the conference who is

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,060
in charge we have 27 member states

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,740
you're responsible for cyber security

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,020
actually who is in charge in the

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,700
European Commission

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,140
thank you Ralph good afternoon everybody

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,320
uh since we stole four minutes from the

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,939
previous funnel let me start on a more

31
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,640
personal note uh on the date

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,360
today 16th of February

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,740
it's the date that I joined the

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,960
commission

35
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,060
33 years ago as a junior official

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,420
so it's by professional uh birthday if

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,259
you like

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,900
and I'm very proud and I'm sharing with

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,939
you this Pride that the history of this

40
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,939
institution I'm the only one who had

41
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,619
joined the commission at the start of

42
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,540
the food chain

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,420
and reached the College of Commissioners

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,680
it's a different Europe

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,320
back then in 90 different Europe but

46
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,000
what is common

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,939
is our belief that we can only cope if

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,860
we cope together as Europeans

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,979
the second anniversary thing I wanted to

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,680
to start with is that not only a few

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,679
days later since we met last year

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,760
the war The Invasion took place

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,099
but let me remind you that our meeting

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,099
was in the midst of a pandemic

55
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,980
we spoke to a camera there were no

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,300
people

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,660
and let me say that the facts that

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,040
across Europe

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
we managed to cope against the pandemic

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,300
is a big European success story

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,780
that has not been told enough

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,000
but we managed to took our lives back

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,459
and we still see what happened in China

64
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,580
recently so now putting aside the

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,400
personal uh starting points who is in

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,599
charge

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
I think in cyber security when we

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,760
discuss the European perspective there

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,819
is not one single player there is no

70
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,200
Cristiano Ronaldo

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,379
this is not the issue of a single

72
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,140
individual it's not a one-person job

73
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,580
uh

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,260
it's a man shaft

75
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,840
it's a team Europe let's call it team

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,980
Europe

77
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,500
and team Europe brings together

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,220
institutions or member states our Angels

79
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,099
our agencies and Industry

80
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,340
but there is also another team which is

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,840
team West

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
and there we also work with NATO with

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,599
like-minded allies with everybody who

84
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,580
shares our model of society and our

85
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,340
values of Freedom so we are working as a

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,120
team

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,739
and we're building

88
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,280
a planetary alignment we're not

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,620
constructing a New World by ourselves

90
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,080
but we make sure that all the elements

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,620
of this alignment are in place

92
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
I like the symbol or the picture of the

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,720
team because everybody has to play a

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,180
role even Ronaldo needs other players to

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,640
score goals right and so everybody needs

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,959
to contribute that's probably what we

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,860
want to say so testing to one year back

98
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,700
and now how has Europe proven its

99
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,380
resilience and this bustness it

100
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,418
preparedness for cyber

101
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,019
well first of all I think looking back

102
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,360
we have managed to produce a new

103
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,540
regulatory uh environment which was

104
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,419
missing or to be fair it was not

105
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,520
actually missing it was

106
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,160
insufficient to cope with the magnitude

107
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,080
and the intensity of the of the threats

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,840
we're facing so we

109
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,639
manage in record time for European

110
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,979
standards to propose and to have adopted

111
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,139
this package of networks information

112
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,840
system that needs to directive and we

113
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,479
put it aside on another directive with

114
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,180
the protection of our critical entities

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,699
resilience the infrastructure the

116
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,080
protection of our critical entities

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,120
because we saw what happened in America

118
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,060
with uh with a pipeline the type of of

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,580
threats normally go together so that's

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,840
done now

121
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,660
this new regulatory environment is there

122
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,720
and is not how should I put it it's not

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,240
a heavy one it's not something that

124
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
creates a new obligations but it creates

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,620
regulatory Clarity for everyone to play

126
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,199
so that's that's good and that's big

127
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,240
the second thing we're doing is that we

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
have now crisis mechanism with C clone

129
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,520
and member states and others that when

130
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
the red button needs to be pushed

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
we know whom to call and what to do and

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,039
we've done that many times

133
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,500
the third time that worked the third

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,539
issue that worked in a year is that

135
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,860
during the war

136
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,300
we saw

137
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,320
that contrary to the predictions of

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,419
total cyber war and

139
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,180
an all-out attack of by the Russians to

140
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,180
Ukraine and to the West

141
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,199
this did not materialize

142
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,600
and this did not materialize

143
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,880
because we were ready

144
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,340
because from day one

145
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,300
we dispatched many good people to to

146
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,300
give not only us not only one shaft

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,759
Europe but also team West

148
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,039
and there were

149
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,880
very robust resilience systems put in

150
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,139
place

151
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,199
that creative you like

152
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,160
the reluctance of the attacker to go all

153
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,900
guns blazing

154
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,539
this is another European success story

155
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,720
it has not been discussed sufficiently

156
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,300
but when the war will be over I guess

157
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,539
there will be many pilgrimages to give

158
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,900
to see how this was organized

159
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,060
but we hope that it's over soon but I

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,580
think geopolitical tensions don't relax

161
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,860
I think on the contrary I think we are

162
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,539
in a situation where there's a lot of

163
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,060
tension we still feel that something

164
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,520
happens in the East right in China in

165
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,000
Taiwan so from your Viewpoint from the

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,699
learnings last year to now you say we

167
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,919
have been very robust and resilient and

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,199
we should talk about that but are there

169
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,720
any learnings and any further things to

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,419
be prepared for the future as it did not

171
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,759
relax over time

172
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,979
this commission the underlying

173
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,819
commission we started our mandate on the

174
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,740
2nd of December

175
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,199
2019.

176
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,680
so from that time until now

177
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,639
we only had four months of geopolitical

178
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,680
calmness

179
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,699
until March 2020. since then

180
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,000
what happened was unprecedented historic

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,400
it was a great acceleration of

182
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,740
geopolitical Crisis uncertainties the

183
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,680
first pandemic since 1918

184
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,720
than the instrumentalization of

185
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Migration by authoritarian leaders from

186
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,780
Turkey Belarus who wanted to weaponize

187
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,000
people to attack Europe through

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,300
migration

189
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
the invasion of Ukraine so we had four

190
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,620
months

191
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,479
of calm Waters

192
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,940
and almost four years

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,240
of Perma crisis I think this is the word

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,419
that we it's appropriate by the way it

195
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,580
has been included in the Harper's

196
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,640
dictionary in in Britain as the new

197
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,059
world of 2022 a Perma crisis situation

198
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,839
so the fact that we coped

199
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,320
is something that makes us stronger

200
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,440
than we ourselves believe of ourselves

201
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,540
but also some of our enemies think of us

202
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,060
and I'm not

203
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,220
increasing expectations I'm very

204
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,860
pragmatic on that so cyber

205
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,380
is a perfect example

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,660
where our Collective will to build

207
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,500
resilience awareness preparedness and

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,180
response

209
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,480
will be measured

210
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,660
and you are asking me what is yet to be

211
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,600
done I would say two things

212
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,279
first move from our regulatory approach

213
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,040
and services approach so far to a new

214
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,300
territory

215
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,240
which is the territory of products

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,540
and that we did with the proposal that

217
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,019
we presented for a cyber resilience Act

218
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,500
people buy products they put them in

219
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,880
their homes

220
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
and we have a duty

221
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,140
and with the internet of things and the

222
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,820
interconnection of society we have a

223
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,880
duty to society to tell them look guys

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,740
it's safe

225
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,019
at least this is a European Duty so

226
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,300
that's an opportunity The Proposal is on

227
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,220
the table I want also to assure industry

228
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,680
that is an intelligent proposal it's

229
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
it's it's it's good for business if you

230
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,640
like because regulatory certainty

231
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,519
creates also a consumer's interest so

232
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,320
that's one new thing where I see

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
progress and another one which is

234
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,240
probably to be discussed not in this

235
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,680
building but in the buyers of its cyber

236
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
defense

237
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
I think uh and then I we are on camera

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
so I I would not go into much detail but

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,420
I think on Cyber defense also drawing

240
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,240
from the experience of the war in

241
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,380
Ukraine we should organize

242
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,820
appropriate teams

243
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,440
of people

244
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,519
not State also trusted people from the

245
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,760
industry that when we meet them they can

246
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,480
be mobilized effectively and act in a

247
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,640
solidarity platform that would help us

248
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,860
these are the two things that are yet to

249
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,600
be done well that's an interesting part

250
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,579
because I run a company I have a

251
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,180
security area our csczo is also here and

252
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,740
if you take those people away I can't

253
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,459
protect my company so I think I think

254
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,000
that building up resources and skills is

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
probably needed but I see your point of

256
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,620
that it when it comes to the point that

257
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,019
we have to act together as a team but

258
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,560
building up resources teaching and go to

259
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,540
the universities and have enough courses

260
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,220
probably is instrumental that we have

261
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,220
both enough resources overall but coming

262
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,959
back to the products you mentioned who

263
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,700
is doing who's creating the products

264
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
under what circumstances is it the

265
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,440
industry or is it a combination of

266
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
Institutions and Industry is there

267
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
enough investment already from your

268
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,240
perspective

269
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,000
uh before going to the products got back

270
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,519
to the people

271
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,399
this idea of trusted individuals acting

272
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
solidarity is not something that we have

273
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,339
in mind by massively depriving your

274
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,100
people and mobilizing them for for the

275
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,220
war no I I we have an idea of these

276
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,440
people being reigned good Rangers you

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,560
know fighting for the good cause and the

278
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,540
skills element my head of cabinet

279
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,459
discussed it extensively I'm not

280
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,160
mentioning the skills is like

281
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,140
stating the obvious we need more people

282
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,420
but not only a cyber Everywhere I Go

283
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,920
Everywhere I travel in the European

284
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,880
Union I get always the same complaint we

285
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,920
need more people

286
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,140
and the people we have are not skilled

287
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,940
enough for the challenges of the labor

288
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,680
market that's probably the core of the

289
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,920
problem I guess because I think as

290
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,600
running a company of course I would

291
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,459
support that endeavor if we are attacked

292
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,079
that we have to protect ourselves right

293
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
territorial but also the company but

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,339
also our institutions but building up

295
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,440
the people and the resources that's

296
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,480
probably our joint issue which we have

297
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,519
to work upon sorry back to the products

298
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,760
the it's not Brussels that builds the

299
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,660
products we're very bad at it

300
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,160
we've never built a product this is not

301
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,260
in our line it's not our Core Business

302
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,680
our Core Business is to make sure that

303
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,800
standards services

304
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,700
can be developed by industry in the

305
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,000
biggest single Market of the world

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,120
we this is our real strength

307
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,060
we are the biggest and the better

308
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,200
regulated single Market of the world

309
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,660
so

310
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,899
the miracle of of the Four Freedoms

311
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,740
now needs to be kept sustained in the

312
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,260
new challenges we face at the time when

313
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,760
I joined the commission was the freedom

314
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,540
of capitals people services and products

315
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,100
now

316
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,380
is how standards

317
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,600
would be developed in a way that would

318
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,700
allow industry to Market produce

319
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,579
innovate but at the same time

320
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,339
given Assurance to Consumers and we also

321
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,820
have many we have 450 million consumers

322
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,660
that in this new era where their lives

323
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,940
their daily lives from their fridge to

324
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,800
their clothes to their cameras to their

325
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,899
iPhones will all be interconnected

326
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,279
being European

327
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,860
means being safe

328
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,440
and this is the Cyber resilience act it

329
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
is not something that we will decide we

330
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
decide democratically by the European

331
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,920
Parliament and the member states the

332
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,740
proposal we presented a few months ago I

333
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,540
would strongly advise that we start

334
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,000
discussing on how best to do this

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,940
yeah I like the approach but Europe as a

336
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,139
single biggest Market is a little

337
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,760
complicated sometimes for a company

338
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,139
dealing with all the different

339
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,880
legislations but but here are some

340
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,779
numbers

341
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,420
the United States spends on Innovation

342
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,480
and Technology every single year it's a

343
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,300
new record hide in 2022 like

344
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,440
approximately 680 billion dollars

345
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,240
if you take China

346
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Japan Korea and Southeast Asia over a

347
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,139
thousand billion dollars Europe comes to

348
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,339
530. so that means Europe is doing 20 of

349
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,660
the global spending Technology

350
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,360
Innovation that means we have money

351
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,699
but from my perspective

352
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,440
we don't spend enough money on

353
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,220
technology and cyber Technologies so

354
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,839
from your perspective

355
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,079
from the EU commission what can we do to

356
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,480
make it more attractive that companies

357
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,699
spend more money on this because the

358
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,100
money is not the core issue but how do

359
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,380
we make this Market attractive

360
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,560
well one of the sorry for the question

361
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,779
that's a mega question as they say in

362
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,820
California

363
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,220
the the first of all I think you're

364
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,839
right we have money for innovation in

365
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
Europe for research

366
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,980
it is not within my remit of

367
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,279
responsibilities this is my colleague

368
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,199
vice president uh stagger and Maria

369
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,600
Gabriel the commissioner for research

370
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
who are managing this budget

371
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,459
you are right that this is big money

372
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,500
but

373
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,660
it is a cake

374
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,660
that many people chase

375
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,660
it's it's it's I mean if we're

376
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,160
discussing cyber now if if we were on on

377
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,579
a Pharma or in a food context then

378
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,180
people will tell you the future is

379
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,399
innovation in agriculture and in the

380
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,260
food sector everywhere on a health

381
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,199
context people would tell you the future

382
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,160
for this money is only genomics life

383
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,660
science so there is a need to balance

384
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,199
um

385
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,120
um

386
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,959
in cyber I think we cannot match with

387
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,139
Brussels money or EU money the needs of

388
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,500
industry but we can act as a catalyst we

389
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,759
can act as as a spark if you like

390
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,320
and then we need something between

391
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,220
Brussels and the business Community

392
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,319
which is innovators

393
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,740
not all innovators are with the industry

394
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,040
some are trying to work with startups

395
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,900
many are in Academia so we need also to

396
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,319
find this missing link that would help

397
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,780
mobilize

398
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,380
startuppers deep Tech innovators

399
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,600
academics who are very comfortable with

400
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,880
the learning processes but not

401
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,740
necessarily with industrial components

402
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,440
all this is to be done I agree

403
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,059
now um

404
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,919
looking at the watch because we still

405
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,780
have to be there's red cards here right

406
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,520
because if you get the red card music is

407
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,880
playing but but if you if you have let's

408
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,940
say A Wish free for the next 12 months

409
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,760
what are your specific objectives for

410
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,980
the next 12 months to be achieved or if

411
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,200
you sit here again what would you say

412
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,799
what was really good within this year

413
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,100
well I'm hoping and this is half joke

414
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,280
half true for 12 boring months

415
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,140
after everything we went through I think

416
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,260
we we all married some calmness I'm not

417
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,240
sure we'll get it but still

418
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,320
for me

419
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,260
the one of my key priorities in my

420
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,240
portfolio responsibilities is to build

421
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
this we call it the EU security Union

422
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
it's a house with a single roof

423
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,720
underneath

424
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,900
of which we are building the individuals

425
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,320
the individual chambers of security

426
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,679
fight against terrorism organized crime

427
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,900
corruption child abuse

428
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,760
cyber security critical infrastructure

429
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,539
we need to do this under one single roof

430
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,020
because what Europeans expect from us is

431
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,700
not policy responses that are driven

432
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,520
merely by segmented interests they want

433
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,880
security macron gave this famous speech

434
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,860
in sorbonne in 2017 and he said I want

435
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,600
to be very short

436
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,660
the only thing I expect from Europe it's

437
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,660
a Europe that protects people need to

438
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,940
see Europe as a shield

439
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,460
and this is what I want to achieve to

440
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,160
build this security Union house as a

441
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
shield in a way that all Chambers

442
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,020
communicate and of course one of the big

443
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Chambers if not the living room would be

444
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,000
cyber security

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
dear best friend thank you very much our

446
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
time somehow is over but if I would

447
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,260
summarize the key points from our talk

448
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,980
here is that we are a team in Europe

449
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,140
and if I combine it with the numbers I

450
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,120
mentioned then there is the only way to

451
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,160
act as a team because otherwise we lose

452
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,400
a lot of resources and power if you not

453
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,860
utilize that skill everyone individually

454
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,900
maybe is far too small

455
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
and I think that's something we should

456
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,480
inhale as being Europeans here the

457
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,059
second thing I take is well the industry

458
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,620
should move

459
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,240
because it's a very big market and I

460
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,559
agree it's it's a big market right

461
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,720
sometimes it's a little complicated and

462
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,880
team play is not always easy but team

463
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,280
play is practically speaking our only

464
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,380
option therefore give the vice president

465
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,780
please a big hand thank you

466
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,320
foreign
