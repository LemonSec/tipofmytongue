1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,900
foreign

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:14,059
[Music]

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,100
good morning everybody uh

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
it's uh not quite as nice of a day today

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,140
I didn't believe there was Blue Sky in

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,660
Bavaria in February but I saw it

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,279
yesterday

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,340
um today we're going to talk about cyber

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,080
crime lines of action which is but we're

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,120
really going to focus on cyber crime

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
ransomware and we're very fortunate to

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
have Decades of combined experience here

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
in the National Security Public Safety

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,719
and cyber security realm their bios are

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,219
all on the papers that you have so I

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,960
won't repeat them and we have short

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,480
times so we're going to do Dive Right In

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,000
and I'm going to ask the panelists all

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
to spend about a minute answering the

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
question of what are the current

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,120
shortfalls

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,620
in effectively fighting cyber crime

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,780
right now and how would you fix them if

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,019
you could

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
now for from where I sit and uh I've

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,680
been in the private sector on the vendor

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,560
side for over 20 years so spending

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,900
um literally decades with both public

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,479
and private sector organizations and

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,680
companies

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,960
really I think from my perspective it

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
comes down to two things one there's a

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,700
massive technology Gap that's uh still

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,680
sadly very prevalent in organizations

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,140
both from a software as well as Hardware

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,960
perspective and some of the biggest and

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,880
largest and most critical Enterprises in

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,979
the world today still rely on Antiquated

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,880
hardware and software and that presents

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,280
a you know a major opportunity for cyber

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,799
criminals nation state actors to exploit

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,380
those vulnerabilities inherent in Legacy

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,420
systems and in absence of a massive

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,640
forklift of Technology upgrades really

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
what what we see is a need to fill that

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,560
Gap with effective cyber security tools

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,640
the other important element is I think

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,240
um

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,580
certainly in the Western World there is

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,120
a real lag in terms of collaboration and

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
effective cyber security policies and

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,420
legislation in place and where we see

53
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,660
the biggest impact around that is um uh

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,080
a lack of carrot in the stick in terms

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,500
of enforcing proper cyber security

56
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,540
hygiene uh really encouraging

57
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,260
collaboration between

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,900
nation state and private Enterprises as

59
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,300
well so those two large elements are are

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
what I see

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,660
thank you Nick nixwood an advisor was

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,940
Sentinel one out of Boston Valerie

63
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,560
following up same question to you but

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,420
let's um in addition what are the

65
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,819
current shortfalls uh Nick mentioned a

66
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:51,900
stick why don't you talk a little bit

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,500
about what the scissor stick is

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,379
um hi good morning so sisa isn't a law

69
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,239
enforcement agency but we're an agency

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,900
that focuses in on how do we understand

71
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,459
manage and mitigate risks for the

72
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,900
nation's critical infrastructure and

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,160
especially when it comes to cyber

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,319
security and as mentioned by Catherine

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,360
earlier this morning we have a real

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,459
concern about small and medium-sized

77
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,560
businesses as well as state and local

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,599
governments that are as our director

79
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,120
likes to say Target rich but resource

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,879
poor every week in the US we've seen

81
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,159
ransomware attacks sadly ongoing against

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,099
our school systems against hospitals and

83
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,540
really so from our perspective what

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,120
we're trying to do is focus in on some

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,180
of those sectors that do need help they

86
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,980
don't have a lot of resources and

87
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,159
unfortunately they are targets for cyber

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,920
criminals and so we've in at cisa we've

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
launched an initiative to really focus

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,659
in and help on K-12 education as well as

91
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,940
the health sector and and the water

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,120
sector and we recently released a K-12

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,640
resource guide for educators to help

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,739
them to give them a tool kit on things

95
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,440
to look for to help Shore up their cyber

96
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,599
security we also have a grant program

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,400
that we were recently given where we're

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,040
trying to help our states better protect

99
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
themselves by having cyber security

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,420
plans for their states in order to raise

101
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,760
the bar really I think we've we've

102
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,900
talked about earlier today there's

103
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,579
probably no way to totally eliminate

104
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,260
cyber crime but it's really our

105
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,180
responsibility to make it harder to make

106
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,220
it more expensive for criminals to be

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,560
able to act

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,199
thank you and um Valerie spent years at

109
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,199
the FBI before she went to cisa as one

110
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,699
of their senior Executives the next

111
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,000
panelist John Carlin also was at FBI as

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,820
the chief of staff before moving back to

113
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,580
doj where a couple times so John why

114
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,919
don't you follow up on that

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,460
sure I I recently was at the Department

116
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,699
of Justice as we did the switch of

117
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,259
administration to the Biden

118
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,520
Administration and one of the first

119
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,740
things I started at the justice

120
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,020
department was a task force focused on

121
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,139
ransomware as many of you know I think

122
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,320
our statistics will show that 2021 was

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,180
the worst year in history in terms of

124
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,160
the damages caused by ransomware actors

125
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,800
criminal and nation state

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
I think we'll see a decrease in

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,900
ransomware this year partly because of

128
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,639
the distraction of the criminal groups

129
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,400
by the Russian aggression in Ukraine but

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,919
we'll see an increase of other types of

131
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,780
cyber-enabled fraud business email

132
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,139
compromise schemes in particular so

133
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,479
bottom line I think the threat picture

134
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,240
from Bad actors criminal groups and

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,380
nation states is bad and getting worse

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,220
0.2 would be on the back end as that

137
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,020
problem is getting worse we continue to

138
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,560
see the acceleration of a move now where

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,300
we've taken everything we value from

140
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,340
books and papers from analog moved it to

141
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,139
digital space to bits and bytes

142
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,180
connected it through a protocol the

143
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,460
Internet Protocol the tcpip protocol

144
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,000
that was fundamentally designed not to

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
be secure and interviewed the the those

146
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,460
who designed it uh book I wrote on this

147
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,900
and they said explicitly they thought

148
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,699
about designing it for security and

149
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,800
since that wasn't the purpose they

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
designed it so that it would be insecure

151
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,460
which will be a permanent jobs program

152
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,979
from my friend from uh from Sentinel

153
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,440
when I'm back in private practice now to

154
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,560
to Mark's Pro question and helping

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,840
private sector companies then where are

156
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,880
the gaps and what can we do to impact

157
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
them one I know we'll hear more about

158
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,340
this here is we need to be on offense

159
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,620
and make it for the criminal groups as

160
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,180
painful as possible for them to

161
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,880
effectuate their trade that means doing

162
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,680
things like the the justice department

163
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,840
just did in cooperation with many

164
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,759
countries throughout Europe and private

165
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,139
sector companies throughout the world

166
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,440
which is hack the hacker do things like

167
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,960
if they steal the

168
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,020
um uh if they steal data disable the

169
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,699
data so they can't use it and post it

170
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,880
for profit if they encrypt your systems

171
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,000
do cyber-enabled operations so that you

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,039
steal the keys back from the hacker when

173
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,860
they try to demand Ransom the uh they

174
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,419
don't understand why victims aren't

175
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,220
paying this is the hive case that Brian

176
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,740
will talk about more but secretly that's

177
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,780
because the government is providing all

178
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,180
the victims the keys and so the hacker

179
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,860
is out using a tool that doesn't work

180
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,680
and doesn't realize it if they steal if

181
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,539
they get a payment or extortion payment

182
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,300
steal it back like in colonial pipeline

183
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,099
where they're able to recover the

184
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,080
digital currency that was taken through

185
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,360
wallets the great thing about blockchain

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,660
for bad guys is you can uh anonymously

187
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,360
get the initial receipt the bad thing

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
for bad guys is that blockchain you can

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,199
follow the chain and see where the money

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,180
went and it is very hard to get it from

191
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,580
digital currency into fiat currency and

192
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,319
into the pocket of the bad guy so that

193
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,199
creates vulnerabilities for them if you

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,300
can't get the money back disable the

195
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,000
wallet so they can't uh enjoy the

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
proceeds of their theft if you see where

197
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,699
the servers are launching the attacks

198
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,419
seize and disable the servers this

199
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,660
cannot be a unilateral approach no

200
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,759
country can do this it raises important

201
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,979
questions of sovereignty for it to be

202
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,840
effective at the speed and scale of

203
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,639
cyber it's going to take groups like

204
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,259
this and the people who are here today

205
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,960
working across borders to effectuate

206
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,699
these tools at speed so that's one go

207
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,099
after the bad guy increase the cost and

208
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,840
the second really is on the victim side

209
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,819
of the house of both have addressed

210
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,279
which is when I work now uh even with

211
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,779
the largest companies in the world

212
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,599
because this technology is fundamentally

213
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,899
insecure it means not just focusing on

214
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,580
trying to prevent the attack from

215
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,979
occurring but this shift of mindset that

216
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,500
we're slowly seeing uh develop towards

217
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,019
resilience and resilience sometimes

218
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,720
means being able to use systems

219
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
particularly with critical

220
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,140
infrastructure in a way that is not

221
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,720
digitally enabled I think we've seen

222
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,420
actually some success in Ukraine and the

223
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,040
resilience of Ukraine against Russian

224
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,339
cyber attacks because they are able to

225
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,920
operate plants and others facilities

226
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,680
manually in the US that's an important

227
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,360
lesson I think in Germany as well and

228
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,760
across the country that you sometimes

229
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
the old-fashioned way works best this

230
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,060
was true with our election and to have

231
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,040
things like in the election context

232
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,120
paper ballots with physical Machinery to

233
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
maintain the skills and capabilities of

234
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
operating a plant manually are going to

235
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,700
be important to be secure at least over

236
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,680
the next five to ten years until we

237
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
innovate our ways out of this

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,540
thank you John that is a lot of good

239
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,640
info there the next person keeping in

240
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,220
the FBI theme was sent over specifically

241
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,440
to speak to this group because of his

242
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,180
recent leadership on the hive

243
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,060
investigation and takedown he's the uh

244
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,420
the FBI cyber criminal operations lead

245
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,640
I thank you very much Mark um and

246
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,100
pleasure to be here I always uh I'm

247
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,660
curious you know when people get out of

248
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,640
the government and they're more free to

249
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,019
talk about some of these things is how

250
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,279
they happen I just want to make it clear

251
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,140
that everything that we John said we did

252
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,240
is all with lawful authorities

253
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
um when we hacked the hacker and we

254
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,080
steal credentials and things like that

255
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
that's based off court orders and the

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,740
jurisdictions that supervise them so I

257
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,060
just want to make it clear that we're

258
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,980
not going rogue on any of you

259
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,300
um but if you need a lawyer I'm here for

260
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,560
you

261
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,620
the uh um as far as you know what do I

262
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,940
see out there and I was trying to keep

263
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,440
because I used to do Consulting so I was

264
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
trying to keep with the rule of three

265
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,019
and I just can't get there so I'm gonna

266
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,940
go with the rule of four so um if that

267
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,500
sticks then I'm going to trademark that

268
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,320
thing so the areas where I think we

269
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,899
really need help is on the victim's side

270
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,060
so John talked about that

271
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,160
um we are only getting about 20

272
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,940
reporting on victims and we can't do our

273
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
job and our partners law enforcement

274
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,660
can't do our job if we don't have all

275
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,700
the information coming into us they are

276
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,680
just like us they make mistakes the more

277
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,540
they do things they leave breadcrumbs

278
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,940
their VPN drops on things that provides

279
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,980
us opportunities to take advantage of so

280
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,779
the more reporting that we get the

281
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,839
better that we are

282
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,079
the second is the private sector we

283
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,940
can't do this we have great coalitions

284
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,620
and great Partnerships across the globe

285
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,260
that are working these problems but most

286
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,779
of the data most of the information and

287
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,160
a lot of the capabilities actually

288
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,380
resides in the private sector and so

289
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,880
we're having to partner more and more

290
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,160
with the private sector it's not an easy

291
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,779
thing and it's been alluded to up here

292
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,000
of based off privacy rules and things

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
that we have in the United States and I

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,839
know other places we have got to get

295
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,820
beyond that if we want to make a real

296
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
impact on this environment and see a day

297
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,440
where we see private sector and law

298
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
enforcement working hand in hand in the

299
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,420
midst of the trenches of these types of

300
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,100
things

301
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,399
um the uh the other part is that from a

302
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,040
victim side is looking at this it's not

303
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,839
a technical problem

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
um I was so encouraged earlier when we

305
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
heard about the thing about you know you

306
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,220
need process and people and technology

307
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,500
and I think that is so true these are

308
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,300
business systems and we need to start

309
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,160
thinking of this as a business problem

310
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,620
it's not an I.T problem that you

311
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,300
squirrel away to the guys down in the

312
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,480
basement who manage your servers

313
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,980
these systems are there to support our

314
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,980
business needs and so we need to get the

315
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,200
business Community to get more engaged

316
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,060
that this is their problem to help solve

317
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,560
and it's not something that they can

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,959
just uh push off to other people and I'm

319
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,399
going to save the fourth one for another

320
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
part of my conversation thanks actually

321
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,120
uh I'm going to go right back to you

322
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,160
with this next one about if you could

323
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,540
just tease out a little bit the

324
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,480
importance of international alliances in

325
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,339
the cyber crime ransomware fight I'm

326
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,420
going to go to you but then I'm going to

327
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,339
ask Sissa to follow up and then if our

328
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,620
other uh panelists want to jump into and

329
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,260
before we go to the next question so

330
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,060
maybe use some examples of your most

331
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,700
recent if that's uh appropriate yeah

332
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,899
happy too

333
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,760
um so certainly within the hive

334
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,639
investigation that we just had uh the

335
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,860
first announcement on um so I want to

336
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,480
make it clear that that investigation is

337
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,040
not over

338
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,579
um but that if you look at the uh press

339
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:06,899
release that we put out there I think

340
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,120
there's 11 different countries that were

341
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,360
involved in it as well as europol as an

342
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,339
entity

343
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,920
and that is pretty common that is almost

344
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,660
every single one I can't think actually

345
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,940
I cannot think of one of our major cases

346
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,279
that we have at the FBI that we do not

347
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,800
have international partners with and

348
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,560
particularly European Partners we were

349
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
talking last night about those are

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,540
really some of our closest relationships

351
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,800
and that comes from

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
uh you know where the servers are

353
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,880
located but it also comes from the

354
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,480
capability and so we have to make sure

355
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,980
that we're partnered up with entities

356
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,500
who have the requisite skill sets to

357
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,120
address this and I'm pleased to report

358
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,339
to people in this room that in Europe

359
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,579
you have very capable law enforcement

360
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,639
um things where as we talk about you

361
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,920
know when we talk about the hive uh

362
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,839
investigation

363
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,180
it's an example of what we call joint

364
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,820
and sequenced operations and that means

365
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,920
that if you look historically at how we

366
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,839
did things it would be you big a big big

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,940
take down at the end and you try and get

368
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,160
as much as you can within it and we're

369
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,959
recognizing that that model doesn't work

370
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,820
anymore we need to put pressure on the

371
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,980
adversary which means that we need to be

372
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,860
doing this an ongoing basis over a

373
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
length of time and put pressure on them

374
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,899
every day of the week because that's

375
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,000
what they're doing to us and so high was

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,940
an example of us and our partners taking

377
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,040
those sequenced operations and you will

378
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,880
see

379
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,620
things like

380
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,320
one country making an announcement on

381
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
something and there may not be other

382
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,320
countries on there but that actually may

383
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,699
be part of a joint and sequenced

384
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,740
operation because we are going to be

385
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,959
timing this over time and let the right

386
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,300
place at the right time with the right

387
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
capabilities address what those issues

388
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,920
are thanks and um so FBI has had

389
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,339
attaches around the world for decades

390
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,079
sisa is a relatively new agency in that

391
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,820
context so can you speak a little bit

392
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,380
about what you're doing to plus up the

393
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,440
international coordination for ciso yeah

394
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
no for sure so one thing that said if

395
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,180
you you are all aware of or not is that

396
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,760
sis a host U.S cert team so the computer

397
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,040
emergency Readiness teams and we

398
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,320
interface with over 150 different sir

399
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,940
teams around the country I mean sorry

400
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,399
around the world and that's really the

401
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,339
way that we engage internationally we

402
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,940
share information regularly on threats

403
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,440
you know with each other so that we can

404
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
see if there's a trend going on

405
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,560
somewhere else in the world that can be

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
shared back and we can share it through

407
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,699
that that certain Network I want to say

408
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,980
too that we team up a lot with the FBI

409
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,500
since they have a physical presence the

410
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
last time I was at the FBI I think in

411
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,940
over 76 locations around the world and

412
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,519
so even recently in the case where the

413
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,899
government of Costa Rica and the

414
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,459
governments of Montenegro experience

415
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,399
ransomware attacks

416
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,959
FBI was able to have people boots on the

417
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,820
ground to help those those countries but

418
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,680
we were able to remotely provide

419
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,440
assistance in cases like that

420
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,940
and if I could jump in Mark I think

421
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,380
that's a great example because we had

422
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,240
other instances like Montenegro and then

423
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,639
we're partnering with the Germans and

424
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,260
the Dutch and bringing their expertise

425
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,120
in where we may have one person on the

426
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,160
ground but we've got a whole Coalition

427
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,600
of international Partners who are

428
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,920
helping out

429
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,920
all right thanks next time John I I want

430
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,000
to go to you and then I want to go back

431
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
to Nick on this next one about hacking

432
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,720
back since you brought it up

433
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,639
um I know Brian clarified it but what

434
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,860
are you saying Wild West just you know

435
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,440
if you see something do it

436
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,920
yeah no it's I get this question a lot

437
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,500
and understandably because if you're in

438
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,800
a circumstance using the wild west

439
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,779
analogy where you don't feel like the

440
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,820
government is helping you and that

441
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,860
criminal groups where you know the name

442
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,600
of the criminal group you know the

443
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,639
location from the IP address of where

444
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,079
the attack is coming from you think you

445
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,540
do you think you do is attacking your

446
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,300
company can I go hack them back myself

447
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,120
and do can I go get my data back can I

448
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,160
go disable the data that they have taken

449
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,359
I think for the private sector uh as

450
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,939
you're outside uh Council or general

451
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,220
counsel will advise the answer is going

452
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,500
to be no that's not probably a good idea

453
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,319
and I know uh publicly traded company

454
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,359
should be doing that because of the risk

455
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,959
under U.S law uh there's the Computer

456
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,799
Fraud and Abuse Abuse Act and it could

457
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,419
be a criminal act that you are

458
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,220
undertaking when you go to do the attack

459
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,140
back I think there's two reasons why

460
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,380
that's probably sound policy as well one

461
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,020
that Mark was alluding to is it sure is

462
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,880
hard to get all the attribution right

463
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,799
and the way the criminal groups work is

464
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,720
they're often hacking someone to get to

465
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,700
you which means you may be going back

466
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,520
against a Vic another victim and

467
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,740
intruding upon their system and the

468
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,720
secondly as this group knows and we've

469
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
been discussing are the sovereignty

470
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,039
issues where that can cause escalation

471
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,320
between nation states and that

472
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,660
determination as to when the tools of

473
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,179
the state should be used in a situation

474
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,860
that can cause conflict to use one

475
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,500
example of colonial pipeline you had a

476
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,260
criminal group attack a private company

477
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,280
in the U.S for-profit and for criminal

478
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,020
gain and that caused a oil lines to back

479
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,000
up and essentially a national security

480
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,860
crisis

481
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,320
that group was located in Russia and the

482
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,780
solution of of the state involved

483
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,460
statecraft where the president of the

484
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,620
United States raised the issue with his

485
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,200
uh publicly raised the issue with his

486
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,260
his counterpart that said

487
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,419
you can do what's called active defense

488
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:43,679
it doesn't mean there's nothing that you

489
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,600
can do on your system and so the line I

490
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
would think about is the perimeter of

491
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,220
the your system or Network

492
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,160
you can do creative things like if you

493
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,539
know that there's no system that's

494
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,280
secure as we've discussed and that a bad

495
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,580
guy can enter the system maybe it's a

496
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,500
bad idea to put your crown jewels in a

497
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,660
folder called crown jewels don't advise

498
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,240
that but keep a keep a folder that says

499
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,539
essentially crown jewels and put

500
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,120
information in there that is fake use a

501
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,280
virtual uh environment so you can

502
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,559
monitor the activity of the bad guy on

503
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,660
your system you can also put information

504
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,520
in there that they can steal or

505
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,559
exfiltrate that will not work when they

506
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
try to try to develop it they'll waste

507
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,539
time and resources and you can study

508
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,160
them and gives your Defenders time to

509
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,860
response and I'm sure uh Chris could

510
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,500
follow up on some some of these ideas

511
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,760
finally and this is in I think a gray

512
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,799
space and one that warrants further

513
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,660
exploration or things like beaconing

514
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,580
back so if you apply that same principle

515
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,280
bad guy goes into the system takes

516
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,020
something from your system that they

517
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,880
believe to be yours and it happens to

518
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,940
Beacon back so that you can find uh the

519
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,000
location I think that's a gray area and

520
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,559
if that doesn't cause damage maybe

521
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,720
lawful don't recommend you rush it out

522
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,220
and do that but that's one to further

523
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,860
explore and then finally just to pause

524
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,919
what does that mean though going back to

525
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,559
to earlier comments if if companies

526
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,360
can't go and defend themselves by doing

527
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,340
the attack it puts even more pressure I

528
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,340
think on governments and policy regimes

529
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,679
to allow effective response by

530
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,120
government because what can't be

531
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,160
sustainable is that you know there's

532
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,260
this criminal group attacking you

533
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,539
constantly sometimes with the resource

534
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,240
of a nation-state and you on your own as

535
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,980
a company are left with nothing to do

536
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,500
about it it means you need to have those

537
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,299
Partnerships with FBI you're a pole

538
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,220
Interpol others to take action thanks

539
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,840
Sean now can you follow up on the

540
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,799
industry standpoint on that you know

541
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,780
echoing a few things that that uh Johnny

542
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,460
mentioned

543
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,919
the vast majority of of customers in the

544
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,240
private sector

545
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,640
um as well as the public sector

546
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
emotionally they would love to be able

547
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
to hack back

548
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,140
um that's not practical it's not

549
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,179
feasible in most cases it's not

550
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,740
technologically possible you're either

551
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,140
gonna end up attacking an uh a service

552
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,799
provider an intermediary

553
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,480
and I think what it really underscores

554
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,799
is Need for collaboration between

555
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,080
government law enforcement and the

556
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,400
private sector

557
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,059
um and to leave that element of uh

558
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,140
responding to the experts but you know I

559
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,600
think it's best summed up from some of

560
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,580
the things I heard yesterday which for

561
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,440
the vast vast majority of organizations

562
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,260
defense is the best form of offense so

563
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,419
building a resiliency as John had

564
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,640
mentioned building in even deception

565
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,400
Technologies within uh your own uh

566
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,280
corporate Network cloaking critical uh

567
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,200
data and building in a modern defense

568
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,700
against attacks because attacks are

569
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,799
going to happen as Valerie had mentioned

570
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,960
we're seeing it across I think a common

571
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,580
misperception from folks outside the

572
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,980
industry is that only the most critical

573
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,320
and largest companies are hacked and

574
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,960
what we've seen is in a just an

575
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,020
incredible Rise of opportunistic

576
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,580
ransomware and other types of hacking

577
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,580
attacks against libraries Community

578
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,400
Hospitals small organizations tax

579
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,039
offices with 30 40 50 people because

580
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
sadly they they're going for the week of

581
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
the herd and so uh you know I think it's

582
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
just incredibly important for these

583
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,520
organizations to drive best practice in

584
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,159
terms of having a really robust defense

585
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,640
but then also really um game play this

586
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,860
out understand how to respond to attacks

587
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,559
how to collaborate both within their

588
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,900
industry and partners and I think some

589
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,299
of the some of the encouraging things

590
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,940
I've heard uh both today and yesterday

591
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,580
is really and there is very much a need

592
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,440
for increased collaboration and

593
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,799
legislation around this because I think

594
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,200
a couple Folks up here have mentioned to

595
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,240
date there's a lot of like legislation

596
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,700
that actually discourages information

597
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,620
sharing in the name of privacy

598
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,659
protection Etc and that really

599
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,720
hamstrings responding in the proper way

600
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,700
to these type of attacks

601
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,919
thank you thank you Nick let's um let's

602
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,100
move more into the geopolitical realm

603
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,740
um the the founder of the Silverado

604
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,380
policy accelerator of which I'm a part

605
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,720
of has coined the phrase that we don't

606
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,780
have a cyber problem we have a Russia

607
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,960
China Iran and North Korea problem so

608
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,380
John I want you to put your hat on from

609
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,460
your second to last government

610
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,780
assignment when you're an assistant

611
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,760
attorney general for National Security

612
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,520
Prosecuting State

613
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,740
Affiliated hackers

614
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,360
what do we do with criminals supported

615
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,620
or tolerated by state actors

616
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,980
look and I I agree but fundamentally

617
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,580
with uh with his assessment these are

618
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,280
for a long time I think we thought of uh

619
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,140
hackers and if you ever look at news

620
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,659
reports about hacking it's often the

621
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,280
same uh old b-clip old video clip of a

622
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,980
pair of fingers typing on a keyboard

623
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,740
masked in Shadow but the fact is you can

624
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,980
put uh thanks to incredible work by FBI

625
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,620
Homeland Security by private sectors you

626
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,620
can put faces and names behind those

627
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,740
keyboards and so in that sense I think

628
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,900
the ransomware criminal problem is is

629
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,059
part of the broader problem of how do we

630
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,880
sustain a rules-based order that's under

631
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,059
threat as it never has been before in

632
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,559
the post-world War II uh or uh regime

633
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,080
and in cyber as in other areas actions

634
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,820
speak louder than words I think we've

635
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,679
tried for uh for years to do this

636
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,380
through policy negotiations but the

637
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,919
quest question I think is can we work

638
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,200
multilaterally in order to impose pain

639
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,140
impose consequences that can be through

640
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,539
the form just because it's a cyber

641
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,400
enabled attack doesn't mean the response

642
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,799
is through cyber uh I'll give you an

643
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,280
example a member responding to something

644
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,200
we wargamed out for a year what would it

645
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,059
look like if a rogue nuclear armed

646
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,260
Nation attacked the United States

647
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,480
through cyber-enabled means we always

648
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,760
thought it would be on the energy sector

649
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,260
or some critical structure we were

650
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,940
surprised when it was about a movie

651
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,059
about a bunch of pot smoking journalists

652
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,340
this is the North Korean attack on Sony

653
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,679
Motion Pictures so that was not the

654
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,080
scenario that we had War Games war games

655
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,320
for but if we had tried to respond by

656
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,720
disabling North Korea's access to the

657
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,120
internet I think they're probably the

658
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,640
combined IP addresses and connectivity

659
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,260
of the people in this room is greater

660
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,299
than the nation state of North Korea it

661
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,039
would not be an effective deterrent

662
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,260
that's why I think you're seeing the use

663
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,380
of of other tools lawful tools that

664
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,080
could be used multilaterally the use of

665
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
sanctions both against the criminal

666
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,799
groups involved but also the

667
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,080
nation-states that Harbor them to try to

668
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,900
deny them the access to the next Cutting

669
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,140
Edge phase of Technology through export

670
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,120
controls I'm going to interview her

671
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,400
later at this conference but the deputy

672
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,140
Attorney General of the United States

673
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,600
announced yesterday a new task force

674
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,120
with the Commerce Department in the U.S

675
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,919
working with Partners across the streets

676
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,960
going after those critical Technologies

677
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,620
you heard earlier today from Paul Rosen

678
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,900
overseeing the foreign investment inside

679
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,360
the United States denying the

680
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,220
opportunity through foreign investment

681
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,799
from those Rogue from countries that are

682
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,380
harboring Road Rogue actors to next

683
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,600
phase technology a discussion that's

684
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,900
quite live today is outbound

685
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,419
investment should there be rules that

686
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,539
limit outbound investment from

687
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,179
rules-based country trees two countries

688
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,460
that are not following the rules to

689
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,720
prevent them from developing

690
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,159
technologies that can be used for

691
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,279
offensive cyber attacks that approach is

692
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,220
sometimes called the all tools approach

693
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,559
meaning all tools all legally available

694
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,220
tools as Brian uh pointed out working

695
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,000
multilaterally and just before I ask

696
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,679
another panelists just follow up on that

697
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,600
one of the things about the outbound

698
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,460
investment is it's not just dollars

699
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,620
going to an entity it can be expertise

700
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,600
that goes with that from the Venture

701
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,860
Capital on how to make your business

702
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,840
better and I think the point is we don't

703
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,179
want to

704
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,000
create any more benefits for adversarial

705
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,299
or challenging Nations than are already

706
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,240
there yeah it's and I think it's these

707
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,520
are important and difficult issues that

708
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,080
we need to work through to give because

709
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,059
there's a flip side right you you want

710
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,679
to enable those who want to protect

711
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,600
themselves from autocratic regimes from

712
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,340
getting technology that for instance can

713
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,179
protect

714
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,220
Communications so it's going to take

715
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,940
conversations I think with particularly

716
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,559
transatlantic Partners but really

717
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,360
countries throughout the world and share

718
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,059
the the rules based order on what are

719
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,700
the most effective series of sticks that

720
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,860
we can use that will ultimately change

721
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,419
the behavior of states that are

722
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,460
harboring the these criminal ordination

723
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,320
states that are themselves attacking

724
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,080
private companies for the benefit of

725
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,299
their competitors overseas

726
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,279
okay anybody else want to speak on the

727
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,740
uh how to deal with the tolerated State

728
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,779
actors are we ready to go on

729
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,360
so that was the fourth prong um that I

730
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,220
was had mentioned earlier and it's a

731
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,200
real difficulty for us um when you have

732
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,820
people in countries that we can't get

733
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,640
access to uh you know we're all getting

734
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,380
attacked every day and there's certain

735
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,000
places where this is emanating from and

736
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,380
you know that's not law enforcement

737
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,659
problem but that is how do we put

738
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,059
pressure on those entities to make it

739
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,100
harder for them to do that and that's an

740
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,419
ongoing issue that we need to be

741
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,760
addressing okay so

742
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,919
um I'd like to go to you with reporting

743
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,900
victim reporting

744
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,299
um do we have any good estimates on

745
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,880
victim reporting whether Trends why

746
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,440
don't people report and what are we

747
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
doing what can we do to facilitate more

748
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
reporting I know there's the regulatory

749
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,159
side for certain critical infrastructure

750
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,600
that's going to kick in over a number of

751
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,700
years but can you just kind of run us

752
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,960
through where we are with that and then

753
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,539
I'd ask Nick to jump in on what he's

754
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,159
seeing and then if the other panelists

755
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,600
have anything they can add

756
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
well I think Brian mentioned earlier

757
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,679
we have a real dearth right in reporting

758
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,380
because it's all voluntary right now we

759
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,320
we were fortunate that in March of 2022

760
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,380
we were able to pass the cersea law so

761
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,940
the Cyber incident reporting for

762
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,559
critical infrastructure and we are going

763
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,179
through the rulemaking process as Mark

764
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,220
mentioned so it'll take a few years

765
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,679
before we see the fruits of that but we

766
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,620
are really excited to be able to when

767
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,440
that law does get enacted to be able to

768
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,360
better understand sort of the trends

769
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,919
that are going on when we think even

770
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,720
about the ransomware issue that we've

771
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,880
been discussing here it's hard for us to

772
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
all we know is that the reporting that

773
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,140
we have is underreported so what's going

774
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,779
on is probably just scratching the

775
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,480
surface of the about volume and amount

776
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,580
of activity there that's going on the

777
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,440
losses even that have been mentioned in

778
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
earlier panels are probably even sadly

779
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,299
more than than have been reported and so

780
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,100
we're we're really excited about being

781
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,840
able to have this data when it comes

782
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,460
online and being able to rapidly share

783
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,860
it with our

784
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,000
interagency partners to make sure sure

785
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,700
that we can get the intelligence that we

786
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,159
glean from the data out and be able to

787
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,620
really help protect us as we've talked

788
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,380
about already that really hardening our

789
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,299
defenses is really an important part of

790
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,159
being able to decide to fight cyber

791
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,679
crime Nick can you follow up

792
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,980
yeah I mean I think from my perspective

793
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,799
it is massively underreported one in 20

794
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,100
one in 30 or or greater and there's

795
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,980
several good reasons for that these are

796
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,720
solvable problems and they need to be

797
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,360
solved the first is

798
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,220
most organizations don't know how to go

799
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,080
about reporting they literally don't

800
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,260
know what to do next and what a lot of

801
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,419
them are doing is relying on their cyber

802
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,520
insurer which then brings in a breach

803
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,399
coach who by the way usually are

804
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,080
attorneys and attorneys are like don't

805
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,520
talk to anyone you know the typical

806
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,980
legalese

807
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,940
and related to that I think companies

808
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,500
are really concerned about reputational

809
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,240
damage business damage customer damage

810
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,340
and I think that these things need to be

811
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,380
addressed and mitigated with legislation

812
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,899
and processes where folks and companies

813
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,299
can confidentially and easily report

814
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,700
because I think as Valerie had mentioned

815
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,440
there's really good reasons for having

816
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,960
that data just to understand the scope

817
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,659
size and nature of the problem problem

818
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:33,240
but to date it's it's really a

819
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,779
combination of not understanding how to

820
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,360
do it getting advice from folks who are

821
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,200
you only report if you have to and

822
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,179
um I think that's all against the

823
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,120
backdrop of the chaos that's usually

824
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,340
unfolding during a breach situation a

825
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,659
company is just trying to get back in

826
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,000
their feet and go through business

827
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,059
resiliency and so that ends up taking a

828
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,620
back seat

829
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,659
um you know the reporting and

830
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,240
information sharing aspect so these are

831
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,679
these are things I think we're chipping

832
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,080
away at it's encouraging that we're

833
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,460
addressing it finally for critical

834
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,200
infrastructure but there's a real need

835
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,899
for that to be applied broadly across

836
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,059
all Industries I just want to Echo what

837
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,340
Chris said in terms of of the challenges

838
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,559
that private sector companies face and

839
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,240
that some of those challenges are placed

840
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,200
there by law and Regulation and

841
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,940
highlight a couple parts of that because

842
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,860
I think they're very relevant for policy

843
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,299
in the EU as they are in in the U.S so

844
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,940
one is right now our our laws are skew

845
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,640
around privacy how many of you uh by

846
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,460
show of hands have received a notice at

847
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,919
some time that your data was compromised

848
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,140
in an incident

849
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,820
so it's pretty much the entire room I'll

850
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,559
tell you my daughter was a first piece

851
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,539
of mail and she was very excited to see

852
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,360
her uh name was a notice that her

853
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,880
identity had been stolen in the in a

854
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,860
well-known breach of the U.S

855
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,799
government's Federal data databases so

856
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,480
look I don't think that's a very

857
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,179
effective approach we're all being told

858
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,220
I've got you get multiple notices what

859
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,600
are you supposed to do with the notice

860
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,700
uh at this point you just you know that

861
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,740
you're

862
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,480
information has been stolen multiple

863
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,940
times what's more important in a lot of

864
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,799
these incidents is that there's a

865
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,240
mechanism to get it to the right

866
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,640
government officials to act on it and go

867
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,980
after the bad guys who took the

868
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,620
information but quite to the contrary

869
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,220
because we have this

870
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,299
schizophrenic two-sided approach where

871
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,220
the FBI and some of the other agencies

872
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,960
saying and sister saying come in as

873
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,880
victims we're here to help you have

874
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,919
other agencies who are set up to punish

875
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,440
the company who is the victim of the

876
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,659
attack if we don't get that carrots and

877
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,779
sticks right when we have the internal

878
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,100
counsel they're making rational

879
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,500
decisions as private companies why they

880
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,000
don't want to go forward we have to

881
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,720
change that second and uh I'll say this

882
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,779
uh bluntly in this credit it is

883
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,399
Kafkaesque and absurd that for a period

884
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,200
of time there were harsher restrictions

885
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,800
on sharing data from Europe to the

886
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
United States than there were from

887
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,179
Europe to for instance Russia

888
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,699
how can that be the case but that is the

889
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,859
Privacy regime that has been set up on

890
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,159
data transfer

891
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,260
on data transfer between countries so

892
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,940
that means it's quite complicated if

893
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,560
you're bringing Chris or other or trying

894
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,719
to work with FBI and you're looking at a

895
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,540
breach that is a multinational breach to

896
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,099
get the information you need to

897
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,260
effectively respond to the attack so we

898
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,659
need to change that incentive as well

899
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,599
and third you're seeing the move and

900
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,339
just to lift up what value describing in

901
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,080
the U.S for the first time to have

902
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,859
mandatory confidential reporting to to

903
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,440
the government I know private sector is

904
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,940
quite worried about that that is going

905
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,560
to end up being used against them

906
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,900
instead of against the bad guy there's a

907
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,540
similar move happening in the EU and as

908
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,760
you uh you know leave and work on the

909
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,800
policy on this I think we all need to

910
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,839
work together to try to incentivize that

911
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,000
that information is shared for use

912
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,920
against the criminals and the bad

913
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,839
nation-states and not against the

914
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,339
victims who are trying to protect the

915
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,140
information in the first place thank you

916
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,060
John we have five minutes left

917
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,859
um and I do want to get the audience

918
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,540
questions because I do not want to get a

919
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,160
yellow or red card in our football that

920
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,660
means we have to go back five or ten

921
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,240
yards and that wouldn't end well so why

922
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,740
don't we go to some audience questions

923
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,320
and then we'll if we have time we'll go

924
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,599
to our last question here

925
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,540
um I if you get a microphone over to one

926
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,339
of those Gentlemen please

927
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,640
and a question please not a uh a speech

928
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,500
thank you very much do we have any

929
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,839
expectations from the cyber crime

930
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,000
convention which is negotiated in the

931
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
United Nations under the top committee

932
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,300
thank you

933
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,000
uh any particular anyone in particular

934
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,839
one

935
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:59,040
no not our stuff you know I mean I that

936
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,079
would be more of a question for State

937
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,060
um so I'm not sure we have a former

938
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,619
State Department cyber person in this

939
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,599
room that will hook you up with um right

940
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,119
after Harry's third row on this side I

941
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,380
don't want to put him on the spot though

942
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,800
I'll do it a two-second one which is

943
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,579
um it will have uh respond later it's

944
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,140
been as you know under development for a

945
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,060
long period of time and the interim I

946
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,920
think we need to continue to take action

947
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,440
and some of that action maybe through

948
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,960
bilateral Partnerships through law

949
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,820
enforcement to law enforcement or cert

950
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,480
assert Partnerships because it this is a

951
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,520
law of customary uh law and so you if we

952
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,980
don't take action to show that we find

953
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,320
unacceptable some of these incursions by

954
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,420
nation states through cyber enabled

955
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,640
space we're creating the norm in an

956
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,740
international law that says that that's

957
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,859
an okay use of your intelligence

958
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,260
apparatus that's why what the uh f FBI

959
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,300
worked with europol and others do is so

960
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,460
important to show even when you can't

961
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,200
arrest the individual because it's in a

962
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,200
state that will not uh extradite that by

963
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,420
publicly naming and laying out the facts

964
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,920
taking it out of the shadows in the

965
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,260
intelligence world and saying No this is

966
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,540
unacceptable just like also customary

967
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,640
law and easement if you let someone walk

968
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,040
across your lawn long enough they earn

969
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,960
the legal right to walk across your lawn

970
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,700
it's important collectively that we put

971
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,040
up a giant no trespass sign and say

972
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,720
that's not acceptable that's not a norm

973
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,579
that we want to live under thanks John

974
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,200
do you want you have anything to add or

975
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,280
should we go to the next audience

976
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,780
question all right we had another

977
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,640
audience question over here

978
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,180
gentleman with the blue name tag

979
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,780
thank you I'm uh customer from NTT so

980
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,140
you talked about the um

981
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,540
um this incentive or almost companies

982
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,880
not wanting to report issues right and I

983
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,079
think one problem is that law

984
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,660
enforcement is interested in collecting

985
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,640
evidence and the company is interested

986
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,160
in getting the systems back up so law

987
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,540
enforcement will probably keep the

988
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,760
systems for a while would it be an idea

989
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,220
to just as a as a government for example

990
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,339
offer an infrastructure to affected

991
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,200
companies trucks with satellite

992
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,119
connection whatever where you say you

993
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,619
can use that infrastructure immediately

994
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,680
to be back up and running within base

995
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,839
right and then we have time to do law

996
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,420
enforcement rather than kind of

997
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,940
collecting searching and holding up

998
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,400
getting back into operation so I'm sorry

999
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,619
what was the question who is it to did

1000
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,240
you get that right yeah I can jump into

1001
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,339
this um so as far as with the government

1002
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,200
I'll actually defer on that one but what

1003
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,119
I will tell you is that as far as a

1004
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,280
company reporting and I can only speak

1005
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,160
for how we respond in at the FBI is and

1006
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,960
we've had a significant change over this

1007
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,060
last year is we need to provide value

1008
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,119
back to the so I came to the FBI because

1009
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,920
I wanted to do good

1010
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,940
um and I think you should do the right

1011
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,400
thing for the right reasons and but I

1012
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,900
also recognize there's also other

1013
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,940
competing interests in this and there's

1014
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,160
risk for the entities with regulators

1015
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,780
and things like that so how do we

1016
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,599
incentivize people so we've shifted so

1017
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,099
that we're going to have value in that

1018
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,359
first interaction when you call us what

1019
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,500
I will tell you is that we're not taking

1020
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,140
your servers we're not taking your your

1021
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,300
information we don't want your data what

1022
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,859
we want is we want the indicators to

1023
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,500
compromise we want to know the we want

1024
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,180
to get the logs we want to understand

1025
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,099
the nature of the data because then that

1026
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,480
helps us understand well what are they

1027
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,160
going to do with it we don't actually

1028
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,660
need the data so we shouldn't be

1029
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,680
shutting you down in any capacity

1030
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,660
the other thing is that we know because

1031
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,800
how how we're structured is that when

1032
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,320
you tell us hey it's it's Hive or it's

1033
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,020
lockbit we've got information on those

1034
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,700
groups and that agent who shows up on

1035
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,960
the door either you call on the phone

1036
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,300
they can give you right there to teach

1037
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,599
the most latest ttps the iocs whether or

1038
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,460
not the FBI has the capability of

1039
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,579
decryption on it any intel products that

1040
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,200
we've produced that is immediately

1041
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,180
available to you so that should help you

1042
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,119
get back up and running so that then we

1043
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,680
will get the evidence later on on that

1044
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,660
but that's the interaction so we need to

1045
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,300
speed that up and Hive taught us that 20

1046
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,700
and some people and I agree that may be

1047
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,760
high is what reported to the FBI Ryan

1048
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,859
thank you so much for that answer we

1049
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:13,200
have we have no more time left so I am

1050
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,359
going to ask and then answer the final

1051
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,359
question what preventative measures are

1052
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,700
needed to stop cyber crime happening in

1053
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,980
the first place and the answer is none

1054
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,260
you can't stop it so focus on resiliency

1055
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,550
all right thank you thank you

1056
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:33,219
[Applause]
