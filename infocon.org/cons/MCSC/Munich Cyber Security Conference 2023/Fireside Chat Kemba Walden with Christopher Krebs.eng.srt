complicated

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,040

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,979
so first of all thank you so much for

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,900
the invitation thank you for allowing

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,640
this to be my first public appearance as

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,979
the acting National cyber director I see

46
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,380
a lot of new and old friends in the room

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,920
and so this is fantastic uh

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,479
so the office that I lead uh we are the

49
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,280
primary advisor to the president on

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,899
cyber security one of the primary

51
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,440
advisors our North Star at the end of

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,200
the day is to make sure that all

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,700
communities are able to thrive and

54
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,200
prosper full stop

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,340
and that has been true in my career

56
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,840
since its Inception so I'm a National

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
Security lawyer by training a cyber

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,540
security lawyer specifically

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,340
immediately before here I was at

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,900
Microsoft I stood up the counter

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,239
ransomware program in Microsoft digital

62
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,400
crimes unit I was the primary lawyer for

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,360
what was then called defending democracy

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,980
at Microsoft but before that I was at

65
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,760
DHS for 10 years in a number of roles

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,920
the most notable was that Iran team with

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,720
something called team Telecom on behalf

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,620
of DHS I was the primary lawyer on for

69
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,420
the secretary at the time on the

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,560
committee on foreign investment in the

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,879
United States and then I found myself

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,420
becoming your lawyer Chris

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,480
um at the side Mr clients at times I

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,319
guess

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,900
you made me a better person

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,540
um but I you know there I focused quite

77
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,920
a bit on financial services and energy

78
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,780
and as you know I was your primary

79
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,580
lawyer in elections

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,819
um so I bring all of that experience to

81
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,280
this role it's all relevant it's all

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,900
relevant to making sure that communities

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,000
are able to thrive and prosper

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,340
so one thing that was left out uh in in

85
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,819
my background is I I also uh worked at

86
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,980
Microsoft and ran U.S cyber policy and

87
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
kind of one of the the the stories at

88
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,540
least the beginning of the the bite

89
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,159
Administration was that if you wanted a

90
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,860
senior uh position in cyber security in

91
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,360
the U.S federal government you had to at

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,340
some point had to have served at the

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,379
National Security Agency so I think

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,540
we've found another template for senior

95
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,099
cyber officials that's working at

96
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,900
Microsoft and it's sisa and you can find

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,659
yourself into these senior roles so uh

98
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,640
well done

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
um relatedly and it you know we're now

100
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,519
in the third year of the the Biden

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,500
Administration and in at least in the

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,060
U.S

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,959
um every Administration is fixated on

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,420
strategies and National strategies uh

105
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,920
the the Trump administration had their

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,500
National cyber security strategy and uh

107
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,418
you know the rumor is that there is a

108
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,820
Biden National cyber strategy which was

109
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,280
one of Chris english's priorities uh

110
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,340
kind of in the offing if not you know do

111
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,880
for release any any day any moment now

112
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,400
so if if those rumors are in fact true

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
and let's assume they are what would a

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,500
strategy uh what would that look like

115
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,120
what are the priorities and you know

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,639
what's the framing and mentality behind

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
a Biden Administration National cyber

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,300
strategy

119
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
yeah so if the rumors were true

120
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,400
um this this National cyber security

121
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,080
strategy the president's National cyber

122
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,699
security strategy is quite

123
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,759
forward-leaning and quite bold it has it

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,620
represents two fundamental shifts and I

125
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,940
know we're suppressed for time I can

126
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,860
talk about this for 20 minutes but I'll

127
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,540
try to capture it in just a couple two

128
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,380
fundamental shifts uh the first is that

129
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,900
we have to shift responsibility for

130
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,060
cyber security risk right we have to

131
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,060
lift it off of end users and put it onto

132
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,360
producers to to right so lifted off of

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,759
consumers put it onto producers lifted

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,620
off of state and locals put it onto the

135
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,180
to the federal government so we have to

136
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,919
lift and shift that cyber responsibility

137
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,620
make it defensible make the systems that

138
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,320
we have defensible and then what do we

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,820
do with that residual risk we have to

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,639
incentivize

141
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,800
long-term Strategic investment ensuring

142
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,320
that the the

143
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,600
technology the people in the processes

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,020
that compose cyberspace remain resilient

145
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,500
remain reliable remain safe so we have

146
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,600
to invest in those ways so there's some

147
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,180
some opportunities for for incentivizing

148
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,460
investment that you'll see in the

149
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,840
strategy and some opportunities for

150
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
lifting and shifting one of those

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,720
opportunities is to

152
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,520
harmonize regulations on the part of

153
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,580
Industry uh regulate parts of Industry

154
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,340
that are not regulated and doing that in

155
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,100
full consultation with industry so that

156
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,000
we are properly incentivizing the buying

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,699
down of risk in All Phases of production

158
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,160
right so we move it off of the end user

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
the end user put it onto the producer

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,180
and and

161
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,340
cause those strategic Investments to

162
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,620
have a Level Playing Field in that space

163
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,120
so that's one opportunity that you'll

164
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,400
see in the strategy it is a positive

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,740
strategy we've been playing whack-a-mole

166
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,660
for a long time and we've been allowing

167
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,780
the adversary in a lot of ways to set

168
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,400
our agenda and this is our opportunity

169
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,580
now to get in front of the adversary

170
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,080
thinking strategically

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
so I you know over the last couple years

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,220
one of the shifts that I have seen at

173
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,860
least in practice is that regulatory

174
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,979
shift and taking more stride in action

175
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,199
to ensure that companies are doing the

176
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,080
right thing with a a bit of a sense that

177
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,880
perhaps the market has failed and and

178
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
that we need to take more direct action

179
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
against organizations I think after

180
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
Colonial pipeline that was probably the

181
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
first indication when the Transportation

182
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,660
Security Administration used some of

183
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,460
their regulatory authorities and we saw

184
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,500
a Cascade there I think it's going to be

185
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,180
a challenge these things don't happen

186
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,759
overnight I do think that regulation is

187
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,199
inevitable but I also think it's

188
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,660
inevitable that the first try or two

189
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,419
won't work there will be mistakes so

190
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,220
that partnership piece and the working

191
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
with industry but not in a way that's

192
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,180
deferential to Industry it takes the the

193
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,340
input that's going to be critical

194
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,720
um and so as we you know I mentioned

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,819
Colonial

196
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,300
that's a that's a example of how the

197
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,580
threat landscape has has dramatically

198
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,020
accelerated over the last couple years

199
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,479
but of course we have to think about

200
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,419
where we are we're at the Munich cyber

201
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,819
security conference uh in advance the

202
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,099
Munich security conference and this time

203
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,120
last year the big debate was is Russia

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,220
going to invade Ukraine and we saw that

205
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,139
a you know a week or so after the

206
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,180
conference last year Russia did in fact

207
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,919
and now we hear reports of potential

208
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,840
massing at the border of additional

209
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,300
troops and and uh fixed and rotary Wing

210
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,539
aircraft so perhaps there'll be a

211
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:27,240
escalation but let's talk about what's

212
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,979
happened in the geopolitical space in

213
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,560
the last year how have how has that

214
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,500
Russian invasion of Ukraine uh shifted

215
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,140
at least in the Cyber landscape and what

216
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,000
are some of the key Lessons Learned From

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,219
A government perspective as well as from

218
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,979
a private sector perspective

219
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,660
you know it might sound like I talk in

220
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,540
threes but I have I have three thoughts

221
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,519
uh that come to mind well

222
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,800
let me give you the Prelude February

223
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
24th is when you as when Russia invaded

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,839
Ukraine February 25th is when Chris

225
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,339
English asked me to be his principal

226
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,600
Deputy

227
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,060
um and so this has been on my mind quite

228
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,160
a bit uh

229
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,600
three fundamental lessons that I've

230
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,700
learned in this space

231
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,240
the first is that uh

232
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,200
Ukraine the people of Ukraine have have

233
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,260
demonstrated how important people are to

234
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,019
defense right

235
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,060
they have demonstrated that defense is

236
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,260
in fact the new offense that there is an

237
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,880
opportunity for

238
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,600
um

239
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,279
capacity building for training for work

240
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,019
leading up to something catastrophic

241
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,880
like this Russian aggression and they've

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
been steadfast and we've been steadfast

243
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,420
with them in defending their networks

244
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,920
the second thing I've learned which is

245
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,300
sort of on the other side of the coin

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,820
which is cyber offense is actually

247
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,839
really difficult right it is it is

248
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:55,860
um

249
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,920
part of an entire campaign for kinetic

250
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,160
War right we've we've over assumed that

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,860
because of Russia's activity in Ukraine

252
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,899
and in other parts of that part of the

253
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,440
world we've we've over assumed

254
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,519
um cyber's place in cyber War we've over

255
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,240
assumed Russia's ability to maintain a

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,839
cyber offensive turns out not only have

257
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,040
we over assumed it but it's really

258
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,820
difficult to do right so cyber offense

259
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,519
isn't necessarily something that we need

260
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,920
to think through separate and apart from

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,220
regular kinetic war and then the last

262
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,820
piece that I think that you'll see in

263
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,600
our strategy is that narratives matter

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,899
president zielinski really got in front

265
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,300
of the narrative

266
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,000
um and that's that is important for a

267
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,060
couple of reasons one uh we were able we

268
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,680
the United States was able to share

269
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,220
intelligence uh in in unique ways not

270
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,500
only to help our operators of critical

271
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
infrastructure defend against what we

272
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,220
would assume would be retaliatory

273
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,579
activity but also to help disabuse any

274
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,820
notion of misinformation related to the

275
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,160
war and president zlinski was masterful

276
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,440
and and his and his team were masterful

277
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,060
at that narrative and so between the the

278
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,640
defense the people that were that are

279
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,019
there on the front lines defending

280
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,360
Networks

281
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
it sort of demonstrates in my mind

282
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
what's meant by this subtitle

283
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,860
dealing with blurred lines of

284
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,660
responsibility responsibility and

285
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,700
accountability and the people in

286
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,339
cyberspace are at times more important

287
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,660
than the technology that they're

288
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,300
defending at times

289
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,459
I think uh this is something we talked

290
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,519
about over uh last year in April here at

291
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,220
the at the Cyber conference a number of

292
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,100
us were surprised that the networks

293
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,180
particularly the Telecommunications

294
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,160
Network withstood the initial Onslaught

295
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,440
and attacked by Russia which allowed

296
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,420
president zielinski the platform by

297
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,820
which he could you know command the

298
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,100
information space which was which was a

299
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
surprise on a couple different levels

300
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,399
one is the the prowess you you've

301
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,140
mentioned about that we kind of put

302
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,720
around Russian cyber operations but also

303
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,480
the the adeptness with which the

304
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
Russians historically use information

305
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,820
operations and it was quite a quite a a

306
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,700
tables were turned moment so with all

307
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,160
that in mind uh with the Russian

308
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,019
invasion Ukraine the Lessons Learned you

309
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,720
know how the ukrainians uh defended

310
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,920
themselves

311
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,019
I think we we all recognize this is not

312
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,940
the last geopolitical conflict there are

313
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,680
other geographies there are other spaces

314
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,139
around the globe where there could be an

315
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,019
escalation point what are you know you

316
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,360
like the rule of Threes so do I what are

317
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,040
some some recommendations or advice

318
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,019
would you give to you know just

319
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,839
notionally Taiwan to prepare for a

320
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,399
potential Invasion are there any lessons

321
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,920
learned that you have there

322
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,079
so a few things

323
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,820
um

324
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,279
one capacity building and training are

325
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,860
key and it's a it's an all of us

326
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,700
proposition uh so it's not just the

327
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,279
responsibility of the government to help

328
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,920
with training and capacity capacity

329
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,740
building and making sure that our

330
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,920
people defending the networks are able

331
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,519
and skilled and have appropriate

332
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,740
accountability and Leadership but that's

333
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,279
one the the other piece is that

334
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,220
this is an all of us proposition so one

335
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,600
of the things I didn't mention in

336
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,399
Ukraine was that a lot of the US

337
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,320
government

338
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,519
capacity building and training and I

339
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,480
know that that was the case for other

340
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,339
countries responsible countries but the

341
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,260
private sector supported that

342
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,019
proposition right with

343
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,420
um you know the starlink satellites and

344
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,600
moving Ukraine's infrastructure into the

345
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,399
cloud and there were there were there

346
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,440
were opportunities for not only the

347
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,180
public sector governments but the

348
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,820
private sector to be able to lean in and

349
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,920
defend and the other thing I would

350
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,139
mention is that again I can't I can't

351
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,540
triple underscore this I can't foot

352
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,360
stomp this enough but the defense is a

353
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,980
new offense I don't know if Chris Krebs

354
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,959
or Jenny easterly coined that first but

355
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,760
it's true

356
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,420
it's you have to have a proper defense

357
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,420
integrated with a proper offense you

358
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,639
can't have an offense without the

359
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,339
defense piece and I think I think we

360
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,700
woefully underestimated the

361
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,360
um

362
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,180
the resilience the reliability of a

363
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,699
proper defense in in this space yeah I

364
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,740
think one of the lessons learned from

365
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,839
the initial invasion of Ukraine by

366
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,199
Russia in 2014 was that capacity

367
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
building piece but also partnering with

368
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
part with foreign governments you know

369
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,380
cyber U.S cyber command defending

370
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,779
forward deploying teams into Ukraine to

371
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,699
help understand what's happening across

372
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,440
the networks and we benefited from that

373
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
from an election perspective because we

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,519
saw activity that we could bring back to

375
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,760
election officials in the United States

376
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,620
and you know I think that's part of the

377
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,019
new model going forward and so with that

378
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,480
in mind International cooperation what's

379
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,600
the what's Leyland look we're in Europe

380
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
one of the things that as I mentioned I

381
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,860
really learned from and benefited from

382
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,959
particularly on Election security is how

383
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,399
vibrant the cyber security

384
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,779
Partnerships are in in the leadership

385
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,639
and you know I I developed you know

386
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,380
solid friendships Karen Martin who was

387
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,399
my counterpart with the ncsc is here

388
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,740
you know how does that play a role in

389
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,060
whether it's Ukraine or back home

390
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,339
defending the US what what's the state

391
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,639
of play in international cooperation

392
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,920
I'm going to start small and then talk

393
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,440
International so I've I've done a lot of

394
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,060
engagements at the state and local

395
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,600
Municipal level in the US also done

396
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,459
International engagements and forums

397
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,320
like this and in country to Country

398
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,579
engagements have an engagement with

399
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,420
Bavaria tomorrow I think or later today

400
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,040
um

401
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,040
our digital ecosystems are are dependent

402
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,139
upon each other so my the United States

403
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,540
our digital ecosystem is only as strong

404
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,139
as Germany's is as Benin as Mali as

405
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,839
Mexico's it's it's an entire ecosystem

406
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,180
and we are facing

407
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,600
um common problems right once we find

408
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,079
that common problem we can we can face

409
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,240
those challenges together and find

410
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,660
common Solutions that's not just with

411
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,279
state and local governments and federal

412
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,500
governments that's internationally

413
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,720
across with our allies and our partners

414
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,000
that's with industry

415
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,339
we have a common cyber security problem

416
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,920
they're not entirely unique problems

417
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,380
across Industries right

418
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,240
um and so

419
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,880
that professional intimacy that I talk

420
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920
about sometimes between the public

421
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,660
sector and the private sector between

422
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,439
State and locals and federal sector

423
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,919
between Academia and Civil Society

424
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,799
um between end users and Enterprises

425
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,619
that professional intimacy is key right

426
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,260
coming coming together to find the

427
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,199
problem and coming together to find

428
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,599
active effective solutions to those

429
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,059
problems I think that's the

430
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,520
that's my takeaway engaging

431
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,559
internationally that's what we need to

432
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,520
do as we partner in this space and

433
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,220
that's that's not just here in Europe

434
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,840
but that's also in the geopolitical

435
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,360
South right in the global South

436
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,340
so recognizing that we only have a

437
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,260
couple minutes left and I don't want to

438
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,120
get a red card and have to sit out the

439
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
conference next year

440
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,020
um so let's talk about next year so

441
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,840
you're back here next year uh you'll

442
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,080
have been in the role perhaps for a year

443
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,020
what do you hope you will have

444
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,940
accomplished as the acting National

445
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,980
cyber director you know assuming you've

446
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,600
got a strategy out what are what are

447
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,980
your hopes a year from now that you've

448
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,780
been able to accomplish and whether it's

449
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,640
you personally or the world has been

450
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,740
able to do uh in in terms of cyber

451
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,780
security

452
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,660
so like I said earlier my North Star my

453
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,220
office is North Star I think many of

454
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,460
your your goals are to make sure that

455
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,600
communities are able to thrive and

456
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,400
prosper in this interconnected world

457
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,440
full stop right our refrigerators are

458
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,000
connected at this point my mom does

459
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,640
online banking which scares me to Pieces

460
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,780
but I just want to make sure that

461
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,460
everybody's safe

462
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,620
um it does

463
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,880
uh so I view the stand-up of the

464
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,500
national cyber director's office it's

465
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,720
the newest on the Block it's a startup

466
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
within a sea of startups in the white

467
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,380
house

468
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,000
it's a symphony you stole my line that

469
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,700
was the siciline oh did I it was a

470
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,380
startup but it's fine it's fine I'm

471
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
proud of you I'm proud hey I was there

472
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,460
at a startup I'm you know I'm I'm going

473
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,200
two for two now

474
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,860
um

475
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,900
three for three the ransomware counter

476
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,960
ransomware at Microsoft so I like to

477
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,720
view us as a symphony you have

478
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,179
you know the horn section over here the

479
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,460
strings section the percussions and and

480
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,500
individually they they may sound a

481
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,660
little bit cough like cacophony

482
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,460
but at the end of the day you have an

483
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,559
orchestra if you if you practice it

484
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,360
enough if you start if you stand it up

485
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
properly so we've had three movements so

486
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
far in the stand-up of the national

487
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,780
cyber director we've had the

488
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,460
establishment of it you know having it

489
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,320
established a statute and with

490
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,200
Appropriations we've hired fantastic a

491
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,600
fantastic team

492
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,860
we are hopefully producing a national

493
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,299
cyber strategy on behalf of the

494
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,220
president soon then there are a couple

495
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,980
more there's the implementation plan the

496
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,179
strategy is only as good as

497
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,240
implementation plan and then there is

498
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,919
our Workforce and awareness and

499
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,360
education strategy which I would love to

500
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,160
talk about at some point

501
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,400
um but I in the in the short term that's

502
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,679
my plan but I would like to measure my

503
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,720
success in three ways one is that we

504
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
improve the lives of communities of

505
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,120
individuals in all the communities that

506
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,580
we clarify roles and responsibilities in

507
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,799
this space so that you know like we're a

508
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
rowboat while driving in the same

509
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,100
direction

510
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,059
um and that we make sure that we have

511
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,160
collaborative coalitions and my parents

512
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,980
here at Munich is is in pursuit of that

513
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,080
end but that's what success would look

514
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,059
like for me that we've improved lives

515
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,120
that we have clear responsibilities and

516
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,880
that we are developed strong durable

517
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,799
coalitions

518
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,299
thank you Kemba thank you for your time

519
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,620
this afternoon I think we can all feel

520
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,240
that the office of the national cyber

521
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,799
director is in good hands with you at

522
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,240
the helm so thank you very much thank

523
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,420
you

524
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,479
