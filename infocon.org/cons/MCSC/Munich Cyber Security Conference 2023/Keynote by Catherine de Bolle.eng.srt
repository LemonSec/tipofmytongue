[Music]

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,079
good morning distinguished audience dear

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,420
colleagues I'm very honored to be here

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,279
today and I'm very it's a pleasure for

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,400
me to see you all in person here at the

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,260
Munich security conference

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,019
and I was asked to talk about cyber

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,500
crime and I can talk to you about it for

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,780
hours but I will limit my time

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,860
the threat for cyber crime it evolves

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,579
and it evolves rapidly rapidly in uh

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,440
increase in damage

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,960
in scope and in scale

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,739
and the widespread abuse of privacy

16
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,340
enhancing tools has really lowered the

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,440
risk for detection

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,059
we say cybercrime is also used as crime

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,819
as a service model and this means that

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,640
criminal organizations higher cyber

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,119
crime Specialists to do their business

22
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,240
it's a prominent feature of the Cyber

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
criminal underground community and it is

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,460
a cross-cutting facilitator throughout

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,280
the cyber crime sub areas

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,700
the availability of exploit kits of

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,280
malware services not only serves

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,000
criminals with low technical skills but

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,220
it also makes it difficult for the law

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,400
enforcement and the Justice Community to

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,100
be more efficient in the fight against

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,579
cyber crime and the abuse of cyber crime

33
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,460
and it creates a lot of challenges

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,340
that's why we always have to reinvent

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,640
ourselves and we have to try to find

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,340
creative manage manage how to deal with

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,619
it

38
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,420
multi-layered extortion schemes have

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,200
become a basic Supply in ransomware

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,619
operations information is sold on

41
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,318
criminal markets and forums and this

42
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,860
enables social engineering and intrusion

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,800
to victim systems that's why you can

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,140
have the impression that the meal you

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,000
are receiving the fishing meal you are

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,340
receiving that it's from somebody who

47
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,640
knows because they bought information on

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
the social media forums

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,580
the threat from cyber dependent crimes

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,220
such as malware attacks hacking and

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,620
denial of service attacks has been

52
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,160
increasing in number and also in the

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,980
sophistication of a tax causing

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,980
significant financial losses to

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,879
businesses to private citizens and to

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,260
the public sector

57
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,280
and the non-cash payment roads and cyber

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,640
scams are well established criminal

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,220
activities targeting the EU already for

60
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,300
decades

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,060
fishing and social engineering they

62
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,420
Remain the main vectors of payment roads

63
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,019
and they increase both in volume and in

64
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,640
sophistication

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,140
about online sexual exploitation we see

66
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,599
that there is an increase of online

67
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,780
sexual exploitation over the recent

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,860
years

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,459
in addition the crime remains

70
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,480
underreported and many victims remain

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,120
unidentified and the abusers remain

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,720
undetected because the level of

73
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,580
reporting is still very low

74
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,099
ransomware also remains underreported

75
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,220
despite the facts that the attacks are

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,400
growing in number in scope and in

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,840
severity

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,140
and why do we have so many ransomware

79
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,900
attacks there are three key features

80
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,659
that are coming together and that

81
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,299
provide the opportunity and also the

82
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,480
motive for the cyber crime criminals

83
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,099
first of all we have the digital

84
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,700
environment this makes it easier for

85
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,339
cyber crime criminals to make use of

86
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,279
because they can stay more or less

87
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,100
Anonymous and they can go for anonymous

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,160
payments that's the second feature and

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,919
the third feature data is the new gold

90
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,800
and when you have the data you have the

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,740
ability to ask money so the digital

92
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,680
environment together with the anonymous

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,620
payments together with the data which

94
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,800
goes to financial gains or very

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,740
important features and create the

96
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,560
opportunity and the motive for cyber

97
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,919
criminals and it's not easy to work on

98
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,560
one of the three or to get rid of one of

99
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,740
these three key elements in cyber crime

100
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,620
because it's part of our lives what we

101
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,680
also see nowadays it's that cyber

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,440
criminals they organize their business

103
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,479
in an economic way

104
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,139
so they are more calculated about their

105
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,780
target selection and you might think

106
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,800
that they want to to go for the high

107
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,620
value economic sectors this is not the

108
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,280
case what we see now is that most

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,160
targeted or small and middle firms

110
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,000
because they do not have the big experts

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,759
in cyber security and they have

112
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,820
vulnerabilities in the systems and cyber

113
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,560
criminals they focus on the

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,080
vulnerabilities in the systems and on

115
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,419
businesses that are not so well

116
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,600
protected so we see at this moment that

117
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,080
these small and middle businesses are at

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,360
risk more than before and it's not

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,740
anymore about the high value attacks on

120
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,940
a high on a very big firms because they

121
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,820
have in place a good normally a good

122
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,180
cyber security system so you can be sure

123
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,060
that also cyber criminals they make a

124
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,340
tough assessment about who will be or

125
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,460
not our next Target

126
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,259
and many of the threats in the cyber

127
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,660
crime landscape are of course aggravated

128
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,080
by growing crime as a service Market on

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,199
the dark web and nowadays to go on the

130
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
dark web you do not have to be

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,639
specialized in it anymore because if you

132
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,800
go on Twitter or on telegram you can

133
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
find a link that gives you access to the

134
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,020
dark web and to everything you can buy

135
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,060
and you need on the dark web as a

136
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,100
criminal for instance the kilnet group

137
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,740
they use the telegram channels and the

138
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,380
anonymous groups they use most of the

139
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,620
time Twitter to find their access to the

140
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,060
dark net

141
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,580
uh on the dark net of course you find

142
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,580
the illegal products and services like

143
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,460
drugs weapons child pornography stolen

144
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,699
data and identities which you need as

145
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,100
well as services for committing cyber

146
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,699
crime on the dark web the dark web is

147
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,100
also very important for sharing of

148
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,680
knowledge and expertise for criminals so

149
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,259
you have really training schedules on

150
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,720
the dark web for criminals in cyber

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,900
crime and the dark web users they

152
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,180
continue to improve their operational

153
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,000
security by abusing the end-to-end

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,560
encrypted communication services and the

155
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,139
cryptocurrencies for instance dog web

156
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,560
users are increasingly making use of a

157
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,900
telegram and wicker as their

158
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,940
communication channels because this is

159
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,280
about encrypted communication and it's

160
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,300
not accessible for the authorities

161
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,699
ladies and gentlemen how do we have to

162
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,060
combat these forms of cyber crime it is

163
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,840
a cross-border team effort at europol we

164
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,759
are

165
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,039
convinced that cooperation and sharing

166
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,620
of innovative information is key in this

167
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,160
area nobody can tackle this crime alone

168
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,919
you have to work together not only in

169
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,660
the law enforcement and the Justice

170
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,340
Authority but also with the private

171
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,639
sector also with Academia and certainly

172
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,259
with the cyber security community

173
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,120
and cross-border cooperation I can tell

174
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,780
you is the result of europol we are a

175
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,320
network organization we have to interact

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,539
with civil society with political

177
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,700
authorities with the law enforcement

178
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,520
community of course but also with the

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,140
sets the certs in the different

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,360
countries

181
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,240
with other agencies like Interpol and

182
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,760
other law enforcement agencies in the EU

183
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,779
and Beyond and we believe that no single

184
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,080
actor no single community no single

185
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,500
nation can face the threat of cyber

186
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,320
criminals alone each of us has a

187
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,300
complementary role and we have to Define

188
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,360
this complementary role who has to do

189
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,140
what in the cycle we launched 10 years

190
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,399
ago the cyber crime Center at europol

191
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,140
and we strive to have a close

192
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,959
cooperation with the community with the

193
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,839
industry with academics and we did set

194
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,480
up the cyber security incident response

195
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,260
team

196
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,839
formally this is reflected in three

197
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,019
advisory groups we have seniors we work

198
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,540
together with senior experts from the

199
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
Telecom sector from the Internet

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,580
Security sector and from the financial

201
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,399
sector because the financial sector to

202
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,980
us is very important we can learn a lot

203
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,980
from them for instance the approach know

204
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,519
your customer also in the cyber world we

205
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,160
should know our customers so we have to

206
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,380
reflect how can we Implement good

207
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,320
practices from the financial sector also

208
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,660
in the digital world and in the cyber

209
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,399
security sector

210
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,420
we also see now with the war in Ukraine

211
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,779
the Russian aggression that blurring of

212
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,839
the lines uh as you mentioned it in in

213
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,080
the title here between defense between

214
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
law enforcement and the Civil cyber

215
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,060
security

216
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,320
competencies is there

217
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,620
it's a big reminder to all of us to

218
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,500
reflect on what is our role what have

219
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
what do we have to do as sector to

220
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,959
protect the digital environment because

221
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,540
it's what we want we want a physical

222
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,779
safe and secure world because we we also

223
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,540
want a digital a digital secure

224
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,180
environment for legitimate businesses

225
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,180
and for Citizens everybody needs to feel

226
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,440
also a safe and secure when you go on

227
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
the internet and when you go into the

228
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,839
digital environment with our cyber crime

229
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,019
Center you mentioned already or big

230
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,339
corporations like emotec limit and throw

231
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,279
in Shield also related to cyber crime we

232
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
have big corporations we had the amate

233
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,160
takedown in 2021 and the most recent

234
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,640
operation was a takedown of the hive

235
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,579
ransomware last month's 16 agencies and

236
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,920
13 countries were involved so you can

237
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
imagine that we need a lot of

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
coordination between all these law

239
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
enforcement agencies Security Services

240
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,779
and Justice authorities and we do this

241
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,420
through the gcat the so-called gcat it's

242
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,839
a joint community of experts linked to

243
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,120
the cyber security from all over the

244
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,880
world who are in one office at europol

245
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,519
and who monitor in fact what is going on

246
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,339
from a cyber security level when you see

247
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,019
in Australia that there is a new

248
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,720
ransomware immediately you can be clear

249
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,279
to the whole of the cyber security

250
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,000
community at the cyber crime Community

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,459
to spread infect the world so that in

252
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,560
each country they can have a look at do

253
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,660
we have also this problem and how will

254
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,540
we tackle the this problem we cooperate

255
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,420
it's a cooperation platform it's 24 7.

256
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,459
it's monitoring of the cyber security

257
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,800
incidents but it's also about taking

258
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,620
action and setting up big operations

259
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,200
related to cyber crime together with

260
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,680
member states so high profile cases are

261
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,459
always supported by europol

262
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,740
against ransomware actors and the

263
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,240
development of the international

264
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,660
ransomware response model to enhance the

265
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,120
impact of the law enforcement approach

266
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,320
on the overall ransomware ecosystem

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
what we also see is prevention and

268
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,800
support to victims of ransomware that

269
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
remains essential

270
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,040
in the operation against the heavy

271
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,500
ransomware we identified the decryption

272
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,620
keys and we share them with the victims

273
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,399
of this group and helping them to regain

274
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
to access their data without payments to

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,579
the Cyber criminals that is the big aim

276
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,779
of the operations we manage we invest in

277
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,660
pan-european a prevention in awareness

278
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,779
and in victim mitigation efforts and for

279
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,000
that working with industry in an

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,820
Academia is key and that is why we have

281
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,000
this advisory groups we also have the no

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,459
more ransomware campaign I don't know if

283
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,380
you are aware of that we did set it up

284
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,440
with the Dutch authorities the no

285
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,260
ransomware campaign is translated in 38

286
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,839
languages we sometimes in the tackle

287
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,480
against trans somewhere it's about basic

288
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,519
stuff do you speak the language most of

289
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,920
the time it's in English you also need

290
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,459
to spread the the message in different

291
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,880
languages it's a public tool

292
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,500
um you can download it and it has a

293
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,019
140 decryption tools you can use for

294
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,079
free when you are a victim to see if you

295
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959
can decrypt the data that they took away

296
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,260
from you and we estimated to have saved

297
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,800
1 billion euros in ransomware demanded

298
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,720
by hackers

299
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,420
I focused on ransomware but what about

300
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,760
the future

301
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,820
we need to keep up pace with everything

302
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,300
so we invest a lot in new tools

303
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,800
um tools for the law enforcement

304
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,300
Community tools for the Justice

305
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,820
authorities that's why we work closely

306
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,639
together with the private sector and

307
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,459
with academics and academics to make

308
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,579
sure that Innovation is in the heart of

309
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,040
the organization and that we are up to

310
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,500
date with the tools that we have to use

311
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,399
we invest in skilled people in expertise

312
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,740
and we also try to retain them with us

313
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,620
because when they have been working on a

314
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,600
high level in a law enforcement agency

315
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,760
for instance they are very attractive

316
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,100
for private business so we lose our

317
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,959
people but on the other hand we consider

318
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,600
them also a bit as ambassadors for the

319
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,779
security aspects in the different

320
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:18,600
private sector and we have created our

321
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,300
agency as a hub of innovation for the

322
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,120
law inform enforcement Community because

323
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,760
we bring law enforcement European

324
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,940
agencies Academia and private sector

325
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,820
together we also did set up this year a

326
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,000
digital forensic lab we have a big

327
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,779
decryption capacity built in ispra every

328
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,880
law enforcement agency in the European

329
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,639
Union can make use of that and we have a

330
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
lot of other possibilities with the

331
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,959
Innovation that we are developing a lot

332
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,620
so this was in short what we can do what

333
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,680
we do how we see the threat from cyber

334
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
crime and I would like to thank you

335
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,519
again for the excellent opportunity for

336
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,639
us to be here and to talk about the

337
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,100
existing threats and ransomware cyber
