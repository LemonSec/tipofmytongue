absolutely incredible day rich with

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,119
content rich with expertise and we'll do

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,119
our best to live up to that

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,060
um to begin I just want to say thank you

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,559
and I appreciate it

11
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,020
so to begin again my name is Jeff Brown

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,320
I work at recorded future and I was a

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,440
previous ciso for a small City

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,360
over the other side of the Atlantic

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,039
called New York

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,100
um and I'm joined today uh with some one

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,739
wonderful experts in their field

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,719
um first I'd like to introduce Jessica

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,300
Kaiser vice president for the Cyber

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,640
defense center at Bayer AG

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,099
second I'd like to introduce Thomas

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,260
rostek division president of the

connected secure systems at Infineon

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,140
third I'd like to introduce Eric a

25

Lego who's director of the EU cybernet

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,540
at the Estonian information system

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,939
Authority and lastly I'd like to

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,580
introduce Thomas bull

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,100
who is at BSA the software Alliance out

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,280
of Washington DC I may have tripped over

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,900
some of the names but did my very best

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,820
to pronounce them correctly

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,420
um and I I welcome everybody so to open

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,659
up very simply there are some words that

35
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,520
we hear in our industry quite often

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,460
information sharing public private

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,340
partnership secure by Design operational

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,040
collaboration and now sometimes we hear

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
this word integration and

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,100
interoperability

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,079
and I think sometimes when we think

42
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,820
about team play I have to ask a question

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,979
are these just words

44
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,860
are they just concepts are they real are

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,079
they effective are we actually doing

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,560
these things in a meaningful way are we

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,679
executing or are they an aspiration

48
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,560
something we still need to achieve

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,959
um and our conference theme is who's in

50
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,300
charge and this panel again is about

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,080
team play Team often implies Sport and I

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,080
can read a quote from the former U.S

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,180
national cyber director Chris Inglis my

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,739
guess is many of you have as committed

55
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,660
to memory but for those of you that

56
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,420
haven't committed it here is the quote

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,940
the only reasonable solution is to get

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,800
serious about defense to make defense

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
the new offense such that if you're an

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,239
adversary in the space you've got to

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,060
beat us all to beat one of us that

62
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,620
requires an investment upfront on

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,080
resilience robustness not just in data

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,640
and systems but in roles and

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,739
responsibilities that's how you defend

66
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,959
collaboration

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,720
and confidence too so that you need to

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
make sure that everyone in the system

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
understands what role they play in the

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,379
defense of that system said everyone can

71
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,959
participate in their own defense so when

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,160
we think about team play we think about

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,560
sport that quote comes to mind I'm a

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,819
little bit surprised we haven't heard it

75
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,379
quite yet today so I'm glad that I was

76
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,720
the first one to use it and we'll open

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,519
up with a simple question because we

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,260
have an example of team play at work

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,900
right now so

80
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,840
to urke can you provide an example of

81
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,319
how you see team play working

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,540
thank you Joe

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,140
I have two examples for kind of a

84
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,319
outside organization gameplay

85
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,739
and as I'm a director of U cybernet

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,959
which is European Commission

87
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
cyber capacity building Initiative for

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,780
certain countries and it's a center of

89
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,140
this use cybernet we have a 300 cyber

90
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,239
experts from 38 competence areas from 77

91
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,760
European Union member states

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,459
for cyber capacity building actions in

93
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,879
certain countries like some Dominican

94
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,519
Republic Kenya and so on so it's

95
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,739
this is a bunch of cyber experts from

96
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,780
very different areas and how you make

97
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,340
this team work

98
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,900
and

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,380
one important part being a

100
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,620
all over the Europe is to get these

101
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,160
people talk to each other so one way to

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,440
make this missions work and they go to

103
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,300
missions in different countries having

104
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,000
this kind of a International Teams from

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,620
different areas from public and private

106
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,520
sector

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,840
we have this uh setting of

108
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,419
monthly EOS hibernate club which is

109
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,080
Chapman house Community Based we have

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,840
every time good speakers from our own

111
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,419
network and this is a place where we

112
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,040
build this kind of awareness from

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,340
different areas attribution

114
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,199
5G and so on whatever is relevant at

115
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,900
fruit moment and then say house is open

116
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,120
talk and this is a little bit the

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,040
awareness side but it's very important

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,100
that they have this kind of a

119
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,259
doing things together so the community

120
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,660
side of that as this is something we can

121
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,400
relate to all these International

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,259
activities

123
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,560
and second example I have from Estonia

124
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,460
and we are building cyber Reserve

125
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,259
which is a kind of a voluntary based

126
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,259
cyber resilience group and it's a three

127
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,479
level

128
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,600
meant to help critical infrastructure

129
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,639
organizations in

130
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,940
time of incidents so there will be first

131
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,419
level response from National

132
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:49,680
anthesis NCC where this uh first

133
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,259
sponsors go to help this critical

134
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,479
structure organization

135
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,180
when say the incident will prolong

136
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,780
longer or there will be another

137
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,639
competence needed since there will be

138
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,360
second level of cyber volunteers coming

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,500
from National cyber houses we call it

140
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,780
from national government I.T houses and

141
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,560
they come together and help

142
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,539
mitigates this crisis and third level of

143
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,940
answer is not enough hands on the tech

144
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,419
core we don't the

145
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,340
crisis will prolong longer then we have

146
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,800
this National cyber Defense League

147
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,560
available for State volunteers from say

148
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,699
cyber Court

149
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,620
and this three level from different

150
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,240
cyber Security Experts from different

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,520
levels so you have this uh also very

152
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,380
loose connections which is other a very

153
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
important part of sat Community is that

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,220
we have joint exercises we have joint uh

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,340
trainings and especially important is to

156
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,720
share context with this

157
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,819
volunteer group of cyber experts and

158
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,699
both of these communities have common

159
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,460
that you need to rehearse together so

160
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,100
you have this community feeling around

161
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,979
this bunch of different cyber Security

162
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,919
Experts so this is a two places where we

163
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,340
can see that we can have cross-borders

164
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,500
from public and private kind of

165
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,620
cross-borders from different regions and

166
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,780
they actually work together to mitigate

167
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,060
cyber crisis so in a previous panel Phil

168
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,400
Venable said he is a if I get this right

169
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,620
a short-term pessimist and a long-term

170
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,080
Optimist I think that gives me a lot of

171
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
long-term optimism

172
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,699
sometimes I remain though as like Phil a

173
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,039
short-term pessimist and that leads me

174
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,080
to sort of my second question but my

175
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,639
second question is a bit of a reflection

176
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,639
on my own time as ciso in New York City

177
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,580
we were an incredible participant in the

178
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,800
great Community many partners

179
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,620
fielded into the mission but oftentimes

180
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,720
when I woke up in the morning and I went

181
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
bet at night I felt like it was my team

182
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,900
in a trench in the fight and it was a

183
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,699
solo sport that's just the feeling

184
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,639
that's the feeling of a Defender so I

185
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,580
turned to a Defender today and I want to

186
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,560
ask a question

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,780
it's a tough question

188
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,639
can we discuss where maybe team play

189
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,680
isn't working

190
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,599
I'm also going to start first with a

191
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,259
positive example that's good so

192
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,840
um where I see the teamwork is working

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,620
is you see them here on the screen here

194
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,740
cssa so my company is also part of cssa

195
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,479
and it's basically a sharing online

196
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,179
alliance between different

197
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,760
um big german-based companies

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,640
and there over the years there's really

199
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,580
they build up a good relationship and

200
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,680
basically we're sharing very practically

201
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,720
we're sharing information about

202
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,779
incidents we're sharing iocs so it's

203
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,000
very Hands-On

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,860
um and for me this is a perfect example

205
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,140
of how I can scale up my team because

206
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
basically I just have the amount of team

207
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,160
members in my team but by working

208
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,339
together with other companies we're kind

209
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,220
of we're a team and we share each

210
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,019
other's knowledge on what is happening

211
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,420
really happening in our system really

212
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,540
happening um yeah day to day so that's I

213
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,399
would say a positive example

214
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,740
then going back to your question like

215
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,160
the times where we are by ourselves

216
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,019
that's basically when

217
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,000
um I'm and I don't want to make it too

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,360
pessimistic pessimistic but still

219
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,279
um that's basically when I have contact

220
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,740
with government agencies

221
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,600
so

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,940
yeah are you brave enough to say that

223
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,040
again

224
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,660
I'm going to say that we also have

225
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,899
positive experiences but as already

226
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,940
mentioned in one of the previous panels

227
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,720
there's just a broad group of government

228
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,940
agencies so that's also very difficult

229
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,100
for us if because then we get a phone

230
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,380
call from somebody at a certain

231
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,959
government agency that we don't know

232
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,720
that also doesn't trust us but then says

233
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,140
your company is going to be attacked

234
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,140
yeah thank you it's being attacked every

235
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,600
day so um

236
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,700
and then unfortunately that information

237
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,820
first goes to the CEO or the CFO or

238
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,220
whoever so then that has high visibility

239
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,959
which means

240
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean we always react on on that but

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,860
now we definitely need to react on that

242
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
and go and find the needle plus we need

243
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,899
to do communication about it so this

244
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,200
kind of of I would say exchanges don't

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,940
really help because then if we go and

246
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,560
ask for more details they're telling us

247
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,959
no we can't give more details

248
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,839
yeah okay after a while we don't figure

249
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,640
out that it's basically our own system

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,519
that is attacking us because we're also

251
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,620
I mean we're also testing ourselves the

252
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,060
whole time and that's basically what

253
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,820
they are noticing so uh until now it was

254
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,600
always

255
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
good for us that it was never serious

256
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,519
but the problem is that it brings an

257
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,000
enormous internal effort to the teams in

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,640
such a way that internally there's a bad

259
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,079
mood about

260
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,940
um yeah

261
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,420
public government agencies however going

262
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,480
back to also positive we think that it

263
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,980
is really important to build up a

264
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,620
relationship so what we do is that we do

265
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,740
proactively also contact them try to get

266
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,200
into sessions with them but there are

267
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
also there are boundaries because they

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
can't show favoritism towards

269
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,940
um yeah com one or two companies so that

270
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,579
has limits um but I do see that there's

271
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,339
willingness also from them to um to

272
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,060
improve and learn

273
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,200
so I think we've drawn a little bit of a

274
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,140
sketch around the operational picture

275
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,880
and that's important and there is

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,339
positive and negative hands-ons you can

277
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,880
scale up the broad group I heard earlier

278
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
interconnected rehearsed communities

279
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,140
there is possibility they're in but in

280
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,640
order to achieve that possibility there

281
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,399
has to be the appropriate Frameworks I

282
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,040
think that's another level of the

283
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,459
conversation of the team play so to make

284
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,260
change to facilitate that actual

285
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,540
operational collaboration and perhaps

286
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,940
even an integrated defense we need the

287
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,680
right policies

288
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,660
we've highlighted team play that works

289
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,579
and where there is tension

290
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,380
how is this operational reality

291
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,040
reflected perhaps in the policy domain

292
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,339
and first let's turn to Thomas rostek

293
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,279
yeah thank you Jeff um so you know just

294
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,399
a quick word there's two Thomases I

295
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,899
would say go ahead you've got the mic

296
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,339
all right I got confused you've got the

297
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,300
mic man I'm supposed to be Victoria

298
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,399
tonight I've got about this sorry yeah

299
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,019
no worries because I heard policy you

300
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,139
know it was just once we like enthusiasm

301
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,579
because you know unlike you know my

302
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,380
distance panelists were really on the on

303
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,639
the trenches during the cyber security

304
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,440
idea I'm a lawyer and I deal with like

305
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,480
legislations and governments as they

306
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,459
enact policies around the world around

307
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,260
cyber security and we're seeing a slew

308
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,480
of that happening and I think one of the

309
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,579
things that that is uh that we're seeing

310
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,760
is the team play actually is there for a

311
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,279
variety of reasons because one is that

312
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,620
governments need the expertise that that

313
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,779
people like us will bring because our

314
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,459
representative enterprise software

315
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,500
companies companies whose software

316
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,480
actually make everything that we do run

317
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,399
you know from the cloud from artificial

318
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,139
intelligence from everything that we do

319
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,200
you know this is really about them you

320
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,760
know being uh you know being on the

321
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,899
trenches every day and doing the right

322
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,240
thing so bringing the expert is on this

323
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,980
on the type of policies that that is

324
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,620
helpful but also there they are there

325
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,779
from from the perspective of suppliers

326
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,399
to governments the governments are

327
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,899
actually also customers of our own

328
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,540
services and actually relying on the

329
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,060
ability of our companies to to to

330
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,339
protect them uh you know to protect

331
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,620
their their data now you know sometimes

332
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,420
you know you feel the tensions when it

333
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,980
comes to policy and one of the examples

334
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,019
that that we've seen is we're seeing a

335
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,360
lot of of talks around sovereignty

336
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,339
digital sovereignty digital sovereignty

337
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,860
when it comes to cyber security as a way

338
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,959
to achieve you know more robustness more

339
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,519
Independence you know one of the things

340
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,019
that that we saw for instance you know

341
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,760
in in Ukraine and what happened in the

342
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,620
war that started about a year ago they

343
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,000
had some policies of data sovereignty

344
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,279
with localization mandates you know that

345
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,600
is a reality and we're seeing that

346
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,120
happening I'll go into later in details

347
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
we're seeing that happening at the

348
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,180
European level at the moment this is a

349
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,440
terrible thing for cyber security first

350
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,240
of all but second of all it doesn't help

351
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,519
in the operational side of things so the

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,019
Ukraine government had to actually lift

353
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,880
that up so that companies could have

354
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,579
move the data from Ukraine that was

355
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,620
being under attack to other secure

356
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,899
locations in order to to be able to to

357
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,000
continue their operations in that in

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,339
that manner so so we we know what what

359
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,079
what what matters what's important from

360
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,360
our perspective in team play is that we

361
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,300
need to have a real collaboration and

362
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,339
both industry and government need to

363
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,079
understand that we understand we're on

364
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,639
the same team you know we have similar

365
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,199
objectives let's try to learn off of

366
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,720
each other let's not be uh you know uh

367
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,639
you know thinking that we know better

368
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,860
because I either we do this thing on the

369
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,779
trance is oh we do the laws so I think

370
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,880
this team plays extremely important and

371
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,160
we need to Foster that uh even further

372
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,500
moving forward it's really that

373
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,540
communication Nexus and your first point

374
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,760
between those individuals that are

375
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,220
developing and the Frameworks that they

376
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,160
need in order to carry that work forward

377
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,959
and secure by Design Manner and the

378
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,620
second piece on policies

379
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,620
sometimes perhaps not fitting the

380
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,800
operational needs of the users

381
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,139
um but now I'd like to turn to Thomas

382
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,620
okay and you're up

383
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,899
uh actually I would like to to to to see

384
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,699
the the policy topic a little broader so

385
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,139
first there's one thing you need to know

386
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,899
about me which I'm an optimist and what

387
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,940
the tests to this is I'm 20 years now in

388
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,519
security right and I have a lot of uh

389
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,160
contacts with with Also let's say

390
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,860
government agencies but and and what I

391
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,199
would like to to to basically broaden is

392
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,300
policies is about let's say Obviously

393
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,380
first strategies it's about regulations

394
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,120
but it's also and now I come more to the

395
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,500
industry field it's also about

396
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,940
standardization

397
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,980
and I think that's an that's a super

398
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,620
important important thing as I said I'm

399
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,079
I'm an optimist and I see I see on both

400
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,060
sides so on the

401
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,519
on the government side as well as on the

402
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,639
industry side I see

403
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,680
to say it friendly

404
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,720
um possibilities to improve

405
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,060
on the industry side we Face a challenge

406
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,759
that building secure products today is

407
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,500
not incentivized

408
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,079
it is difficult to sell a security

409
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,060
product to a user and I'm not talking

410
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,680
about now critical infrastructure

411
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,959
structure stuff I'm talking about

412
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,940
for example I was brave enough to

413
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,640
install a smart home at home and I hope

414
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,260
it's going to be secure enough

415
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,459
so the incentivation for the provider of

416
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,040
my smart home to do something secure

417
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,559
is limited because if for me it's

418
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,359
difficult to figure out how secure the

419
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,579
thing is right

420
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,799
so in this especially in security that's

421
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,220
why I think there has to be some kind of

422
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,280
a standard the standard could be either

423
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,059
if the industry is clever could be a

424
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,860
standardization

425
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,840
the standardization including security

426
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,179
with a possibility to kind of figure out

427
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,100
what kind of secure how much how much

428
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,100
meter of security I do get and one good

429
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
example talking about Smart Homes is the

430
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,299
meta initiative that's that's currently

431
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,120
started and security is a working group

432
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,340
by itself in there from the beginning I

433
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,260
think that's a good thing if it doesn't

434
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,559
work then also I'm from industry and I

435
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,419
don't like regulations too much but if

436
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,419
it doesn't work we need regulations and

437
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,799
here

438
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,500
um I think the the critical piece is how

439
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,880
do we get

440
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
a competence Exchange in the private

441
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,799
public partnership

442
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,520
because

443
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,480
many government

444
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,400
let's say Regulators are not necessarily

445
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,860
cyber experts right so how do we get

446
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,660
this done and that's not a complaint

447
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,039
because they have to deal with a whole

448
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,900
lot of different things right so how do

449
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,400
we get this done and how we work there

450
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
and they are there are initiatives which

451
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,020
perhaps we can come to later

452
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,520
for example in the U that that kind of

453
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,559
show how that could work how that can

454
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,419
work

455
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,640
Fair would it be fair for me to

456
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,700
paraphrase that something you're saying

457
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,480
is incentivized secure by Design as

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,780
opposed to secure by Design or else is

459
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,080
that a fair paraphrase I would say so so

460
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,780
the incentive can be either

461
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,840
I can't tell if I fail if I don't do it

462
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,160
or I can show How I

463
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,520
um how I compete how I basically get it

464
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,120
in in into a value system of the of the

465
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,260
end user

466
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,320
so I think we've gone a Gambit on this

467
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,140
optimism versus pessimism because now

468
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,380
we're leaning towards optimism and I

469
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,900
think the optimism to have optimism you

470
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,179
have to design you have to plan what you

471
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,700
need to execute upon I'd like to broaden

472
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,260
the conversation we talked a little bit

473
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,419
about

474
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,500
aspects of policy aspects of you know

475
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,679
of the ecosystem of product aspects then

476
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,419
of the operational

477
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,660
uh reality of the Defenders so I'm going

478
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,120
to open it up to

479
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,480
panelists let's talk a little bit about

480
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,700
if we've seen all of the ways where

481
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,520
things can fail what are the things that

482
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,700
we can pinpoint we need to do more of to

483
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,900
succeed

484
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,840
maybe I'll start again as I started the

485
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,880
whole panel off with Erica

486
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,360
okay

487
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,380
I think it's a starting point for

488
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,240
making this team

489
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,380
play happening is motivation to do team

490
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,700
play

491
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,020
so you need to have these motivation

492
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,120
that we actually have to cross borders

493
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,419
you actually have to

494
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,820
we actually have a need to find

495
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,179
different

496
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,220
parties and actors around

497
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,580
cyber security to work together and I

498
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,100
bring one example again from this cyber

499
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,440
capacity building in certain countries

500
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,980
and we have used here in western part of

501
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,360
Europe that

502
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,280
our politicians are already

503
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,900
pretty well understanding cyber security

504
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,620
lasting point but still so it's uh it's

505
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,720
very common when we go there the first

506
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,179
thing we do in during this different

507
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,539
governments and uh new nations we do to

508
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,400
table top exercise

509
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,980
then actually the government officials

510
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,840
and politicians and communication

511
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,660
experts and actors around the different

512
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,640
agencies government agencies

513
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,320
actually feel

514
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,380
that they do not have collaboration so

515
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,080
you actually do not have team play in

516
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,860
place

517
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,260
and then when they actually feel that

518
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,419
when they escalate different incidents

519
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,659
and have this new Crisis coming up and

520
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,140
the escalation goes up and uh how blood

521
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,000
pressure goes up since they understand

522
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,980
that they are missing something and

523
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,220
sends a team play need comes in and say

524
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,880
say anger hunger Wars is kind of a

525
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,000
different awareness and trainings and

526
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,460
and the activities to do that so it

527
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,580
starts with motivation and when you

528
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,000
teach this team sports example it also

529
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,919
starts this motivation we need to beat

530
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,380
this opponent or we need to achieve

531
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,120
something so the motivation is very

532
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,620
important and I think it is a start

533
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,380
where most of the team play starts with

534
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,900
uh better awareness that we are missing

535
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,460
something or we need to do something

536
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,080
better I think that's incredibly

537
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
important point we talk a lot about

538
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,000
exercising but exercising means defining

539
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,740
roles and responsibilities leaning into

540
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,039
those uncomfortable positions where you

541
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,780
may not have a solution and then

542
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,039
identifying you need to work towards

543
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,500
that solution together and I'm reminded

544
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,440
again of uh waterson's comments cyber

545
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,440
security by all cyber security for all I

546
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
think that's an important comment in the

547
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,620
context of exercising we need to

548
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,960
exercise like that so I turned into

549
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,820
Thomas what do you think where are some

550
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,200
ways that we can improve give us some

551
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,460
optimism

552
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,159
I think you know first of all I think to

553
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,780
to the point that you just made I think

554
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,100
we if we order I'm going to say

555
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,360
something that everybody knows in this

556
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,000
room which is cyber security is a

557
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,919
never-ending issue all right it's not

558
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,720
something that is ever finite if we

559
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,580
think we're done and we've got there I

560
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,020
think we're going to fail and I think

561
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,100
that's what that's what we need to do

562
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,020
and and sometimes you know my job is to

563
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,640
talk to governments and around the world

564
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,840
on these things and sometimes they think

565
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,580
well we have the best law we have the

566
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,200
law that asking instead the standard

567
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,659
we're done this is it we can go home and

568
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,520
be happy and we said no no this is

569
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,020
exactly where you guys are wrong this is

570
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,580
where you actually need to focus even

571
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,620
more because you know by the time you

572
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,200
know this this actually comes to be

573
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,419
implemented then you know an industry is

574
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,679
already like halfway there already

575
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,480
because you're not waiting for that then

576
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,740
you know you need to continue with the

577
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,059
next thing and I think so that that is

578
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,020
the thing I think the change in

579
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,179
mentality is extremely important and it

580
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,220
needs to happen you know an industry has

581
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,679
a huge role to play I think we at BSA

582
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,299
you know five years ago we recognized

583
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,460
there was a gap in software Security in

584
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,380
the understanding that lawmakers around

585
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,880
the world including the United States

586
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,220
had about that and we came up with this

587
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,080
software security framework that that

588
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,820
you know we used and developed in order

589
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,200
to ensure to make people understand

590
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,020
about how software is thought as a life

591
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,820
cycle and how you need to address cyber

592
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,380
security every step of the way and

593
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,240
things that goes on and on and on and we

594
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,400
actually work very closely with nist in

595
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,260
the United States within Nissa in Europe

596
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,960
with Mary in Japan to talk about this as

597
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,299
in this is not the ideal solution and

598
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,220
this is not the final thing but this is

599
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,380
our contribution to it we want comment

600
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,780
we want criticism we want but guys take

601
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,120
this use it and actually develop it

602
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,039
further I think collaboratively working

603
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,080
together is is what we need to be doing

604
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,860
so what we need to do is really see that

605
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,000
governments and Industry need to think

606
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,159
on substantive outcomes what are the

607
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
outcomes they're trying to achieve and

608
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,059
this is when the public private Partners

609
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,919
actually works at their best not when

610
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
there's a specific or different you know

611
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,460
ways to to arrive at at the at the end

612
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,980
game that that is thought

613
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,440
yeah and I I would like to piggyback on

614
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,780
on the examples you just made um and to

615
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,059
emphasize one thing which is I think

616
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,919
very important

617
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,380
um what we have to make sure somehow and

618
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,820
I don't have a good solution but that's

619
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,980
why we are here is we have to make

620
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,200
somehow that we are not fragmenting the

621
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,860
world right every every government has

622
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,799
his own ideas about even sometimes about

623
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,080
crypto algorithms right going that deep

624
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,860
have its own ideas about what's um what

625
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,559
uh what needs to be done and let's say

626
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,320
we let's say as a Semiconductor Company

627
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
I will not be able to do sorry to say a

628
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,700
chip for Belgium right so that means

629
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,179
that means we have to come to to

630
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,460
um common Solutions that's why I like to

631
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,260
see us EU working together at least ueu

632
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,940
coming up with one solution right one

633
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,919
one standard going with and that's why

634
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,080
also the industry standards which should

635
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,120
work around the world are super

636
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,400
important for that because otherwise we

637
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,380
can wish for a lot but it's not going to

638
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,500
happen

639
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,100
just very very quickly I'm sorry I

640
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,299
totally agree because if this is one

641
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,620
thing that we're seeing that there's a

642
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,059
lot of willingness around the world and

643
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,620
at least in Europe for the last 10 15

644
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,539
years to do more about cyber security

645
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,159
legislation and we're seeing that in a

646
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,419
variety of fields from Financial

647
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,000
Services sector to horizontal things

648
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,100
we're seeing that a lot the issue that

649
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,539
we're facing as an industry Global

650
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,340
Industries is that different governments

651
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,260
around the world do different ways and

652
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,059
wanted to have different standards this

653
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,620
is not right like-minded countries

654
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,419
like-minded Partners should actually

655
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,279
work hand in hand and this is not about

656
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,679
creating competition on it's about

657
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,720
making sure that we have a secure world

658
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,020
all our society runs on today on digital

659
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,779
on software on on infrastructure if we

660
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,340
cannot protect that then we all will

661
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,200
fail collectively so instead of trying

662
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,880
to like think oh you know we get a

663
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,260
competitive Advantage here or there

664
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,240
let's really try to ensure that industry

665
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,039
governments like-minded again you know

666
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,020
like the liberal democracies that that

667
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,880
we all live in actually work hand in

668
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,140
hand and do they try to compete with

669
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,240
each other on on on on on on on being

670
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,799
low we're going to bring the best

671
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,539
standard no this makes no sense the best

672
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,940
standard is the one that's used by the

673
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,620
entirety of the industry in order to

674
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,120
achieve one specific objective which is

675
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,679
protecting whatever we're trying to

676
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,679
protect on that particular matter

677
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,419
yeah to a certain extent and what I'm

678
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,299
hearing is when you're dealing with

679
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,799
technology

680
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,100
and it's safety security

681
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,460
leaning into aspects of uniformity

682
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,500
could lead us to aspects of

683
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,880
interoperability and safety

684
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,860
how would any of these efforts help the

685
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,740
team that you have each day who as we

686
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,940
said at the beginning is in the fight

687
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,230
[Laughter]

688
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,559
let's open it up a little bit broader

689
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,240
when you think about things like we've

690
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,679
been talking about a lot of different

691
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,120
concepts

692
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,620
for improvement

693
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,240
the key here though is that Improvement

694
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,340
needs to improve the lives of the people

695
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,900
that you work with each and every day

696
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,400
because they're in the fight they're The

697
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,460
Defenders what are ways that you think

698
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,799
we can improve in total

699
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,840
and to a certain extent if you were to

700
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
kind of assign ways

701
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,380
for there to be improvements what would

702
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,620
those be

703
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,120
um

704
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,760
her term is probably

705
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,140
more difficult

706
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,860
because what I see that is missing is

707
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,559
we're just the Cyber defense team and

708
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,940
it's us

709
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,159
in the only group in a company that

710
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,799
needs to protect the company it would be

711
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
great if we can extend that to the

712
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
complete company

713
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,159
but that requires a mindset a security

714
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,279
mindset and I'm also what Thomas said

715
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,919
about the incentive to to have security

716
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,500
and products so I'm actually looking

717
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,919
more at at our next Generation so I

718
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,159
think we should we should have digital

719
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,500
security as a competence that you learn

720
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,720
at school that you understand what it is

721
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,679
about

722
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,960
and in the same way as as we have now

723
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,779
with with the environment then the next

724
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,480
generation will push for that we'll then

725
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,520
have I mean I'm now maybe being very

726
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,400
naive but then we have a company with

727
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,320
security-minded people independent if

728
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
you're in marketing or sales but you

729
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,100
know it's important so you'll take care

730
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,400
that your brand website for instance is

731
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,860
is secure but then also we have policy

732
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,860
makers that will also take care of of

733
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,140
security because they grew up uh

734
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,419
understanding that security is something

735
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,820
that we now need to take care of in this

736
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,480
digital world so and that would then

737
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,320
help I would say my team in 20 years

738
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,200
that's good 20 years isn't that far away

739
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
if you think about it depends on what

740
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,440
mindset you're thinking

741
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,059
um it's really about building a

742
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,460
community of Defenders and I think in

743
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,260
contrast you know something said a

744
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,960
moment ago not fragmenting the world to

745
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,360
me and we talk about this often times in

746
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,279
cyber security also it's about trust

747
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,399
and I have a belief that trust can be

748
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:00,539
established not just between

749
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,399
relationships trust can be established

750
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,960
with institutions trust can be

751
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,580
established between private sector

752
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,620
partners with government partners with

753
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,799
multilateral partners that is how the

754
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,899
team wins

755
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,200
so we have time for a few questions and

756
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,820
I would invite some questions from the

757
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,279
audience I know we're standing a little

758
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,679
bit between here and the closing of the

759
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,200
evening but we very much would love for

760
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,360
you guys to pick the brains of our great

761
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,760
panel here so we'll open it up questions

762
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,799
this is the best so in NYC cyber command

763
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,260
we used to say you should always ask

764
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,140
yourself the first question it breaks

765
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,240
the silence go ahead no I just

766
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,520
make a point maybe it also start some

767
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,720
conversation

768
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,539
I very much like the in the morning uh

769
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,679
when Kemba was talking about this whole

770
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,340
Community effort in cyber security that

771
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,580
everyone should take responsibility of

772
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,039
their own cyber security

773
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,880
and as we think about our parents or

774
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,220
grandparents and when we think about our

775
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,279
neighbors there is a lot of uh not

776
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,980
understanding what the cyber security is

777
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,779
and uh maybe the important part of our

778
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,880
goals in the future should be having

779
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,419
this cyber security part of everyday

780
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,779
life more like uh like does that report

781
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,419
in the morning that part of another

782
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,460
report in the mornings there is also

783
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,880
cyber security cyber weather report that

784
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,399
today we have this kind of a threats

785
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,580
picture around and we have this kind of

786
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,000
possibilities and these actions around

787
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
[Music]

788
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,100
cyber so it's uh when we think about how

789
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,580
to utilize all this uh Community towards

790
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,700
being better aware better ready for

791
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,039
different kind of cyber then this is

792
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,179
something we should work on and cyber

793
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,760
weather will be very nice attachment

794
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,299
if I may I would perhaps propose an

795
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:19,559
alternative

796
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,299
why should

797
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,860
the

798
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,220
user the standard community care about

799
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,700
security how can they because they they

800
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,860
are not the experts they they have no

801
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,659
chance to do this right even if I

802
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,480
provide them with with things installing

803
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
a firewall for many people is already a

804
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,980
challenge right so I think we are

805
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,140
responsible as an as an industry and

806
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,539
also as a government

807
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:47,220
agencies to make that to make that

808
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,640
happen somehow and a good example is we

809
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
can complain about the EU quite a bit

810
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,260
but this cyber security act that was

811
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,299
installed

812
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,820
um is basically now trying to say okay

813
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,620
what do I have to do what kind of

814
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,720
standard I have to set set what kind of

815
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,700
certification I have to do to make iot

816
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,200
devices

817
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
secure why it's this important iot by

818
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,620
the way is the next step of

819
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,779
digitalization in my view when we talk

820
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,100
about digitalization we usually talk

821
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,039
about server Farms but actually all

822
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,299
devices will be even more powerful in

823
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,480
calculating so all of them are Tech have

824
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
attacked vectors that they can get there

825
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,100
so we need to make this secure

826
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,340
so the EU has set this up and I'm I'm in

827
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,380
the in The Advisory Board of unisa so

828
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,539
I'm close to this and also going to stay

829
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,140
exchange to between private um and

830
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,059
Public Partnerships here

831
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,640
um so I like the approach it could be a

832
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
little bit faster

833
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,080
so interestingly this you know is the

834
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,820
topic of the editorial that's in our

835
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,039
sort of conference book and I might

836
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,740
propose conceptually

837
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,200
there is a middle ground in some senses

838
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,419
and we see in other disciplines so a few

839
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,840
weeks ago I went to my son's uh

840
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,559
classroom and talk a little bit about

841
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,359
cyber security he's all of nine years

842
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,918
old

843
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,719
and the kids had tons of questions it

844
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,119
was wonderful they had no idea what I

845
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,800
was talking about

846
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,199
the next presenter wonderful wonderful

847
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,440
person she was a local firefighter a

848
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,940
volunteer

849
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,000
and they knew exactly

850
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,879
what she was talking about

851
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,099
interestingly it isn't that she was

852
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,260
going to make each one of them fight

853
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,020
fires it was that they were conversant

854
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,480
and they understood how important that

855
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,699
function is and they understood who was

856
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,500
responsible for it and I think that's an

857
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,760
interesting middle ground that we see in

858
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,980
other spaces I see some hands in the

859
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,940
back go ahead

860
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,918
foreign

861
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,599
it's more of a thought-provoking

862
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,859
question

863
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,480
um Mike Beaupre had a cyber security at

864
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,820
Hayes so if those of us remember when

865
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,320
the internet came out right the internet

866
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,599
didn't work so well it didn't

867
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,460
communicate so well didn't connect so

868
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,640
well then IEEE was formed then um OSI

869
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,320
model was formed and then all of a

870
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,480
sudden things work things connected and

871
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,040
we have the internet

872
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,380
from your minds what prevents us I mean

873
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,060
we did it for the internet why can't we

874
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,980
do in cyber security what prevents us

875
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,320
from achieving that same kind of

876
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,359
aspiration that we achieved there in the

877
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,619
cyber security space what's the blocker

878
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,300
there

879
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,579
it's the incentive

880
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,220
so for the internet to work for a

881
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,619
function to work for getting a benefit

882
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,960
out of a function

883
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,640
um that was from my perspective was

884
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,920
clear so the internet had some incentive

885
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,599
also some people wouldn't believe in it

886
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,700
in the beginning right but but anyway it

887
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,160
kind of kind of worked and add features

888
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,680
and I benefit from the features you add

889
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,839
security you don't even notice whether

890
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:58,079
you benefit from this feature right so

891
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,480
best case you are not attacked second

892
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,280
best case you attacked and the system is

893
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,500
protecting you right

894
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,579
um it's like alarm systems in houses are

895
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,200
usually built in after the first

896
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,680
burglary

897
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,339
and I think that's that's one of the

898
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,099
major major topic what what I what I

899
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,900
mean with incentive and the incentive I

900
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,339
think the industry to a certain degree

901
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,160
has understood that but that why nearly

902
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,900
all the standards that are worked on

903
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,680
right now take security into account

904
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,760
um but

905
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,000
um but in some cases it's not really

906
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,200
realized and here we have to think about

907
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,700
different means which could be a

908
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,200
regulation then

909
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,260
I think another challenge is Legacy

910
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,200
systems it's like with the house like

911
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,760
the house that's already there it

912
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,800
doesn't have an alarm system until you

913
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,339
can get then um yeah visitors visitors a

914
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,099
new house probably has the alarm system

915
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,380
so that's how I see it at least from my

916
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,839
point of view my company Legacy is

917
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,280
really much more difficult to secure

918
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,460
foreign

919
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,820
record but sometimes we also see at

920
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,220
least in the policy space the number of

921
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,020
all overlapping and inconsistent

922
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,760
requirements that fall upon companies

923
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,740
when it comes to cyber security and you

924
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,940
know what we're dealing you know in the

925
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,820
last term in the European Union in

926
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,900
Brussels with different legislations

927
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,839
that had similar views which is how do

928
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,400
you protect cyber security in you know

929
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,500
Financial Services sector and then you

930
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,660
don't involve the the Cyber Security

931
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,220
Experts you don't involve the cyber

932
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,780
security agencies you have different

933
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,040
during reporting lines you have

934
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,300
different Regulators you have different

935
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,980
structures you have different and at the

936
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,240
end of the day you know companies will

937
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,460
have to to to to to to provide security

938
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,440
for both for the financial service

939
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,000
sector and for others are like you know

940
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,800
what do we do here what is the thing and

941
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,200
then you add to this quite you know

942
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,119
strange in penalties and then you get

943
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,099
companies like like deer stuck in a

944
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:54,540
Handler in the headlights like what do

945
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,160
we do here what is the thing and so I

946
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
think you know again the the issue that

947
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,640
we're facing when it comes to like

948
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,320
developing policies policies take time

949
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,060
policies need to be thought thinking for

950
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,680
cleaning there needs to be a lot of

951
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,720
collaboration there needs to be a lot of

952
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,700
understanding and not just paying lip

953
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,900
service because we're seeing a lot of

954
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,700
lip service so yeah yeah we're we're

955
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,140
going to work with our Global Partners

956
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,820
but then you know when push comes to

957
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,900
shove things are actually being

958
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,339
different and as I was mentioning a

959
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,200
minute ago and and Thomas mentioned it

960
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,119
there's work being done in Europe for

961
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,400
certification for cloud computing cyber

962
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,020
security great

963
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,359
part of this we're imposing General

964
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,579
localization mandates you know for the

965
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,320
highest I mean first of all from an

966
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,000
operational perspective that makes no

967
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,400
sense seconds that would really limit

968
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,440
the pool of companies that can able to

969
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,839
provide services and and with them and

970
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,460
then we're seeing that this this push is

971
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,540
happening we're seeing a lot of

972
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,280
companies from a lot of sectors you have

973
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,079
you know the banking sector you have

974
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,760
some you know cross-sexual sections are

975
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,320
saying like if you do this you're going

976
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,760
to put us out of business you're going

977
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,740
to actually really put our business in

978
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,200
danger but then we sing we don't see a

979
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,960
lot of movement to push past this so we

980
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,540
need to be a lot more realistic and we

981
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,880
need to be a lot more uh uh you know

982
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,800
understanding that that we need to focus

983
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,960
on the outcomes regardless of what the

984
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,700
solution in the end is

985
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,619
so you're highlighting a disconnect

986
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,280
between the operational reality the

987
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,800
business risk adjustment adjustments and

988
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,900
the policies that are being proposed

989
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,800
very interesting

990
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,619
I'm going to give if there are some

991
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,720
questions all right I see some then

992
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,300
that's that's let's have some questions

993
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,020
we've got time

994
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,900
hey uh my name is Timo and I just want

995
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,119
to raise the questions or pick up a

996
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,300
topic between teamwork or liquid

997
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,140
Workforce and uh stuff sort of shortage

998
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,599
is it really like that or is it just

999
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,940
like I'm specialized into identity and

1000
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,099
access management so we have on

1001
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,400
stepstone 25 to 30 new jobs each week

1002
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,040
maybe each day so every company is

1003
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,560
trying to build up its own team its own

1004
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
specialization why do we not really care

1005
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,020
about liquid Workforce and really try to

1006
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,440
bring it in

1007
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,180
so two examples I provided in the start

1008
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,020
basically the

1009
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,140
short time missions to somewhere to this

1010
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,599
critical infrastructure company which is

1011
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,060
struggling with Cyber attack towards his

1012
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,099
third country which is struggling with

1013
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,820
cyber capacity so it's uh two models

1014
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,880
which actually work for this

1015
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,160
persons to have this permanent job in

1016
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,500
somewhere and they have this short time

1017
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
doing something somewhere and learning

1018
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,599
and experiencing different kind of

1019
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,119
activities so I think some models are

1020
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,579
possible it's not easy we have this

1021
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,099
cares of cyber Security Experts

1022
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,740
everywhere but I think it's you are in

1023
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,680
right direction we should utilize more

1024
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,560
cyber experts competencies outside of

1025
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,900
their daily work giving some more kind

1026
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,579
of also excitement and also more

1027
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,820
experiences outside of this setting so

1028
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,220
always is kind of a security clearances

1029
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,160
and information sharing challenges

1030
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,280
around it but still it's a good way to

1031
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,440
enrich a network life at the same time

1032
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,020
solve this kind of a scarce of cyber

1033
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,700
Security Experts

1034
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,940
the challenge that I see is that even if

1035
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,240
your cyber security expert every company

1036
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
is different and it takes a long time to

1037
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,099
understand the company

1038
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,800
so to really do the incident handling in

1039
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,880
the company

1040
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,940
so we're for instance now onboarding a

1041
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,040
lot of people and they're really good

1042
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,680
but we notice like oh it really takes

1043
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,020
time until they understand how that

1044
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,760
specific Network how that specific

1045
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,880
company who's who like the it's on

1046
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,000
different levels technology and and also

1047
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,480
Network like people is build up and

1048
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,760
that's just like you you get experience

1049
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,760
with each incident basically and that's

1050
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,579
why I would say it's not that easy to to

1051
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,680
move people around across different

1052
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,599
companies but it's of course something

1053
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,359
that if that will be possible from a

1054
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,700
label law point of view you could build

1055
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,020
up

1056
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,119
um but it takes time

1057
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,280
I would actually also look at it from a

1058
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,619
being an optimist from a different

1059
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,540
perspective

1060
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,520
I have a problem with cyber experts

1061
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,700
in an earlier panel it was said

1062
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,220
you need a mindset in an organization

1063
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,099
coming from the board down to to The

1064
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:44,040
Experts so there has to be a basis basic

1065
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,619
understanding about cyber security like

1066
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:50,640
everywhere right so I like the what our

1067
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,880
Armed Forces colleague told that the

1068
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,099
that the University of

1069
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,000
of the bundesphere has like 12

1070
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,819
professors on cyber security

1071
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,099
is I think something exceptional

1072
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,040
usually in a university if you find it

1073
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,980
at all it's a Sub sub topic under it

1074
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,800
right something something like that it

1075
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,839
should be embedded in it so it's an

1076
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,119
educational topic and from that

1077
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,420
perspective this doesn't solve it short

1078
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,579
term but it should solve it long term we

1079
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,079
we have to have a basic understanding

1080
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,060
that's also then the internal selling of

1081
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,819
what is needed is is just not necessary

1082
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,119
anymore

1083
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,579
so perhaps then a closing thought

1084
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,980
we began this panel thinking about team

1085
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,060
play

1086
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,579
and I brought up my one job but I do

1087
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,460
have two and they're both involved in

1088
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,819
sports solo Sports and team sports

1089
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,680
and I have to say caring a lot about

1090
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,800
Defenders I've never once heard a coach

1091
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,740
send them out to compete with something

1092
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,440
like you'll probably lose today and

1093
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,140
we'll pick up the pieces afterwards like

1094
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,480
I've never heard that rallying cry but

1095
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,880
in reality we've been saying that to our

1096
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,339
cyber Defenders for a very long time

1097
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,920
and I think if the consensus is that we

1098
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,260
must leverage team play if we're going

1099
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,400
to win

1100
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,260
then I think this panel might also say

1101
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,819
we deserve

1102
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,220
we owe our Defenders

1103
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,500
a little bit more of a rallying cry like

1104
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,060
the challenge is not all the ideas we

1105
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,420
maybe have it is the execution that will

1106
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,700
make their lives better and I think we

1107
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,800
can execute as a team and we can do that

1108
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,020
through legislation through policies

1109
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,780
through standards in our technology and

1110
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,460
what we're delivering is products and

1111
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,380
what we're using and of course in our

1112
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,760
processes

1113
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,119
between governments private sector

1114
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,980
multinationals ngos everyone needs to be

1115
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,319
involved academics included we do this

1116
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,619
right we do this right and we can win

1117
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,230
thank you

1118
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:06,599
[Applause]

1119
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,339
thank you very much to stress this
