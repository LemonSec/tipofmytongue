00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:13,700
[Music]

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,830
so I see the table is for paper

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,640
[Laughter]

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,220
I'm the minister for a digital Affairs

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,920
so I have my tablet with me Dear

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,859
Professor Claudia Eckert dear cyber

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,660
security community

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,520
launched just a couple of weeks ago

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,100
is already changing how we draft our

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,420
everyday communication like emails

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,600
essays or even political statements and

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
the AI arm arms race is just getting

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,920
started Microsoft Google Baidu among

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,160
others are competing to build the next

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,039
generation of chatbot technology

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,000
and who knows what else is out there

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
but while we celebrate the technological

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,760
progress we must realize that this new

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,580
technology also presents us with

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,100
completely new challenges

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,640
used by Bad actors Chachi PT is and its

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,880
successors could be hi-checking our

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,439
democracy

25
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,180
it could for example automatically

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,780
compose political comments and influence

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,340
regulations

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,979
it could write letters to the editor for

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,740
publication in newspapers it could

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,579
comment on news articles block entries

31
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,700
and social media posts millions of times

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,140
every day

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,020
chatbots could also launch a massive

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,900
fake news campaign similar to what the

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,479
Russian internet research agency did in

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,560
its attempt to influence the 2016 U.S

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,520
election but without a million dollar

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
budget

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,680
with the technology such as GPT in full

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,439
bloom and in the wrong hands it could

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,440
create fake news on steroids

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,379
has also added some spies to the modern

43
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,660
cyber threat landscape it could help

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,340
less skilled threat actors effortlessly

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,440
launched cyber attacks from creating a

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
convincing spear pushing email to

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,340
quickly developing malware

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,580
is just a tool after all like a hammer

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,340
you can build a house with with it or

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,140
smash a window

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,000
it's up to all of us in the cyber

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
security Community to tackle the cyber

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,420
security problems triggered by chatbots

54
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,300
in order to prevent damage to our

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
society and to our economy

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,580
for many years

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,360
Bavaria has defended its top position in

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
National Security we need to make sure

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,599
that we have the same level of safety in

60
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,160
the cyberspace

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,040
Peace and Freedom security and

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,459
prosperity in Bavaria do fundamentally

63
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,379
depend on it

64
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,080
therefore we need to ensure that our

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,099
defenses are in place and that in the

66
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,700
event of an incident it's clear who will

67
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,140
take the lead

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,140
we need to work effectively hand in hand

69
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,940
state business the Civil Society so that

70
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,940
we can quickly beat back the attackers

71
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,159
on our democracy

72
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,459
it's not news to anyone here today that

73
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,860
we need to be better positioned for

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,040
cyber emergencies it's Henry Kissinger's

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,860
old question of who do we call when we

76
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,560
want to speak to Europe on every level

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,280
in cyber security today we still don't

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,379
know who to call we don't even know

79
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,980
which line to call on sometimes there

80
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,019
are too many cyber authorities in place

81
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,080
and they are also separated on a federal

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,620
and on an international level in Germany

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,400
alone

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,220
we have over 200 different points of

85
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,220
contact for cyber security each

86
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,699
institution focuses on a different cyber

87
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,780
aspect

88
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
to get to the right information at the

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,300
right time is difficult to navigate for

90
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,840
people within the system and even worse

91
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,940
for Outsiders

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,300
on a geopolitical level we need to

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,000
navigate the fundamental geopolitical

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,259
shifts

95
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,380
Russia has invaded Ukraine in violation

96
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,479
of international law

97
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,660
we see a rise in tensions between the

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,699
U.S

99
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,699
and China who are lying with each other

100
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,460
for political power in addition to

101
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,380
fighting over the dominance in new

102
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,380
technologies such as AI

103
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,460
in recent years an international

104
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,020
imbalance has built up in Europe

105
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,380
vis-a-vis China and the USA in

106
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,560
digitization in robotics artificial

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
intelligence and in cyber security

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,580
we need to ensure that we have access to

109
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,340
key Technologies hand in hand with our

110
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,440
European and with our transatlantic

111
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,520
partners

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,940
a great European partnership is a

113
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,940
necessity for us all as former Federal

114
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,060
Chancellor Conrad Adenauer once famously

115
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,240
said and this sentence is not out of

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
date

117
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,039
We Stand firmly and truthfully alongside

118
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,539
Ukraine with our European and

119
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,600
transatlantic Partners we need to do the

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,539
same in the field of cyber security

121
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,419
at the same time I'm calling for a new

122
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,060
partnership between companies and the

123
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,180
government to enhance the exchange of

124
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,560
information

125
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,020
we need to speed things up

126
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,199
cyber attacks can spread worldwide

127
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,740
within minutes the current EU director

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,660
requiring serious cyber security

129
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,800
incidents to be reported within 24 hours

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,220
does not go far enough I think we must

131
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,280
be or we need we need to be much faster

132
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,699
here to secure our Networks

133
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,520
with our initiative zaiba up there Bayan

134
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,000
we have established an exchange platform

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that connects all relevant cyber

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,819
security authorities in Bavaria however

137
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,419
this can only be the first step so let's

138
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,940
discuss how we can improve our cyber

139
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,039
security ecosystem together

140
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,259
after all that's what we are here for

141
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,660
today at the Unix cyber security

142
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,300
conference we should work together to

143
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,539
ensure that we secure our infrastructure

144
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,440
against traditional criminals and modern

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,860
malicious actors who use

146
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,600
AI for their attacks

147
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,300
one of the most important things remains

148
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,360
that we secure access to key

149
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,000
Technologies the European chips act

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,819
which passed the European Parliament on

151
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,180
Monday is a really good start it's going

152
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,120
to support the technology capacity

153
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,300
building and Innovation across the EU

154
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,560
it's about to enable the development and

155
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,160
deployment of cutting-edge semiconductor

156
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,080
and Quantum Technologies

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,919
the ACT will strengthen the eu's

158
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,919
capabilities and competences in advanced

159
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,940
design in system integration component

160
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,199
production

161
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,800
there are semiconductors in nearly every

162
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,740
device from smartphones to cars

163
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,560
to robots and of course the applications

164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,500
of Industry 4.0

165
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,860
it's therefore essential that we double

166
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,500
our goal market

167
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,680
share for semiconductors from 10 to 20

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,039
percent by 2030.

169
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,740
we also need cutting-edge semiconductors

170
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,080
to build the next generation of space

171
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,960
companies in Europe

172
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,120
um countries around the world are

173
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,159
currently engaged in space in the Space

174
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,440
Race like the last one

175
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,279
decades ago Europe is in danger of

176
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,580
losing out in this race the Ukraine war

177
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,860
has shown that space is now even

178
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,640
becoming a battlefield and we need

179
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
independent access to space and we need

180
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,279
more in innovation in space

181
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,580
Space Tag may still seem

182
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,820
for for some people like a vision of the

183
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,000
future but we see how quickly the world

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,380
changes

185
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,899
nobody thought it would be possible that

186
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,440
a war would take place in Europe

187
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,000
nobody thought that Google's powerful

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,100
search engine would come under pressure

189
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,800
by Microsoft and Chachi PT

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
after all chechi PD is going to change

191
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,540
everything

192
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,459
and nothing

193
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,339
we as humans will continue to stay in

194
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,240
the loop

195
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
Chachi PT can only see the world as it

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,740
um presents itself through data

197
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,920
but it fails to see the world as it

198
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,240
could be

199
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,580
envisioning a better world and turning

200
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,760
in it into a reality that's what we are

201
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,500
here for today at the Munich cyber

202
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,920
security conference and um or to quote

203
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,860
my fellow speaker Campbell Walden

204
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,519
all of us have a role to play in cyber

205
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,339
so let's do this let's get started thank

206
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:02,980
you

207
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:15,070
[Applause]
