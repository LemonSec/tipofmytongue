3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,320
this panel requires no introduction I

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
think many of you recognize the faces

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,820
here but very quickly Dimitri El

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,100
perovich recently described in a

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,560
discussion in Washington as one of the

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,720
leading thinkers on great power conflict

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,240
and someone with a range of experience

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,800
not only in cyber security as the

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
co-founder of course of crowdstrike but

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,079
now leading Silverado a policy

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,940
accelerator think tank with Cutting Edge

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,040
advances in policy development not only

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
in cyber security but in great power

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
related responses we're going to hear a

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,460
lot about that today did Dimitri write

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,140
that introduction did you write that

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,879
introduction no but I paid it of course

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,700
Admiral Rogers our former director of

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,160
Our National Security Agency many of the

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,020
questions that we heard this morning and

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,340
a number of the comments that were made

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,100
by the panelists relate directly to his

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,239
former experience in his current

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,500
experience we're delighted to have him

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,360
join us on the panel today

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,460
and then lastly and perhaps most

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,320
importantly a current leader in the U.S

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,020
government Liesel she is the head of

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,299
cyber for the state department and the

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,439
questions that we received this morning

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,700
I think from some of the audience

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,140
members will get directly addressed by

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,820
Liesel as we go through the discussion

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,880
recently uh coming out of Davos and

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,700
coming into Munich a very well-known

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,460
journalist in the National Security area

39
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,380
Roger Cohen wrote In The New York Times

40
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,080
Davos confronts a new world order

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,360
Kant the Indian president of the G20

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,960
recently said coming out of Davos nobody

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,600
wants the current world order

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,280
pointing out that two billion people

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,140
don't have access to bank accounts

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,880
pointing out that security and

47
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,700
Cooperative security is in Decline Adam

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,460
poser another writer well known in our

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,140
space of National Security and cyber

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,180
security in foreign affairs where

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,939
Dimitri recently wrote an article

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,340
entitled his article the end of

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,780
globalization

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,299
O'Neill another writer in the same

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,119
Journal wrote and asked us a question do

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,979
Regional ties win the day his

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,840
globalization over

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
debates about great powers and great

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,300
power politics and its viability is

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,980
continuing and certainly here in Munich

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,200
this week many of the discussions at the

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,020
MSC and here at the mcsc have been

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,640
around that topic

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,500
the strategy of Western powers that

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,200
economic openings to China Russia and

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
similar nations would lead to political

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,980
opening is being called into question

68
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,200
John Carlin highlighted that during the

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,060
panel led by Mark harmandy just recently

70
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,700
a few minutes ago and many leaders

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,160
didn't attend Davos at all instead

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
coming here trying to reorder in light

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,260
of what Davos the conclusions coming on

74
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,879
Davos were where the headline was

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,040
davos's relevance is fading

76
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,440
I think most importantly for me and for

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,160
other commentators uh in this space

78
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,660
recently in The Economist magazine the

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,819
cover was Zero Sum

80
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,220
and this story The editorial read as

81
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,220
follows since 1945 the world economy is

82
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,080
run according to a system of rules and

83
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,959
Norms underwritten by America

84
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,640
this brought about unprecedented

85
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,340
economic integration that boosted growth

86
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,260
listed hundreds of millions of people

87
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,060
out of poverty and helped the West

88
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,640
Prevail over Soviet Russia during the

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
Cold War today the system is in Peril

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,340
they wrote Mutual benefit is out

91
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,360
National gain is in an era of zero-sum

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,519
thinking has begun

93
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,680
to answer the question let's start with

94
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,659
Ukraine and the question we've been

95
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,400
asked this morning by Peter and our and

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,260
our hosts thank you

97
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,940
who's in charge

98
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,920
uh is the economist right Dimitri what

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
are we seeing in Ukraine and what's the

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,700
answer to this question

101
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,739
well I think to the answer of who's in

102
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,060
charge my answer is always the people

103
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,560
with guns and the people with the

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
biggest guns the the best guns and the

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,640
ones and biggest quantities still in the

106
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
United States

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
um so I will I will stand on that front

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,799
and we're seeing that unfold in Ukraine

109
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,680
but in terms of cyber I think

110
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
this on

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,939
yes can you hear me okay yeah uh in

112
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,519
terms of cyber the biggest lesson I

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,380
think learned from Ukraine

114
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,298
is is actually not a cyber specific

115
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,639
lesson at all it is that when you have a

116
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,860
conflict between two relatively Advanced

117
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,000
powers

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
combined arms matters and it's not about

119
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,160
one weapon systems it's not about one

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,620
particular type of

121
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,180
um uh armored vehicles or uh planes and

122
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,220
so forth It's about the integration of

123
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,860
all those components and cyber is one

124
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,400
element of that integration and where

125
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,759
you have seen Russia underperform in

126
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,800
Ukraine across all fronts has been in

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
that integration of combined arms

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,240
operations and particularly on Cyber

129
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,979
it's not that they haven't done anything

130
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,259
they've done a lot against Ukraine on

131
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,540
Cyber but the only attack I think that

132
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,759
has been that we know has been

133
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,860
successful and actually strategically

134
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,960
very significant has been an attack

135
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,360
where on ViaSat

136
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,120
um that everyone probably knows about

137
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,259
taking out solid Communications in

138
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,060
Ukraine but that was a combined arms

139
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,220
operation it wasn't that they hit the

140
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,360
Assad and disabled satellite

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,699
Communications there was electronic

142
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,620
warfare being conducted against other

143
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,539
Communications methods that the ukraines

144
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,860
were using there were kinetic strikes

145
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,240
against the Telecommunications

146
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
infrastructure it was a combined effect

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,840
of making ukrainians go dark that had a

148
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,580
phenomenal effect in those initial days

149
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,000
of the war and you may now

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,940
um misremember but uh you know Russia

151
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,520
got to the gates of Kiev in the first 24

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
hours of that conflict and took over

153
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,440
about 30 percent of Ukraine in in the

154
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
first 48 hours

155
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,620
everything since then has been going

156
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,460
backwards for them but I think in large

157
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,320
part those successes have been achieved

158
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,900
because they somehow managed to achieve

159
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,280
the element of surprise ukrainians

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,360
really didn't think that the war was

161
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,039
coming despite all the warnings from the

162
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,139
United States and others but also

163
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,660
because they were able to affect their

164
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,520
Communications and their ability to

165
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,100
build up the initial resistance

166
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,080
that quickly changed and the ukrainians

167
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,479
quickly adopted in part because of

168
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,940
support from

169
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,860
U.S and NATO and European Union

170
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,080
countries uh but also private sector

171
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,639
were the old must coming in and

172
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,440
providing SpaceX terminals as one

173
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,660
example of that but

174
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,520
I think over the last decade or so we've

175
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,100
become too enamored with cyber as its

176
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,560
own thing and we need to understand that

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
it's just a piece of the puzzle and how

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,520
it's fits in into the overall picture

179
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,860
particularly in the military campaign is

180
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,800
what differentiates it from being

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,940
successful and achieving strategic

182
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,280
effects or not

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,860
Adam Rogers you know you've spoken in

184
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,199
the past quite a bit about ensuring that

185
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,120
we set the left and right rudder

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,560
and that when we're confronting

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,419
conflicts such as what we're seeing in

188
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,919
Ukraine

189
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,840
um we need leadership we need that

190
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,180
Rudder Set uh after the Malaysian

191
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,280
Airlines Downing after the Cyber events

192
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,600
that we heard about yesterday with

193
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,940
Sandra from Mandy and Google talking

194
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,560
about the wipers at the beginning of the

195
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,220
conflict have we set the rudder

196
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,620
well clearly at the moment I think most

197
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,660
of the parties involved have decided

198
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,340
that escalation Beyond a certain level

199
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,199
is not in their best interest so it's

200
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,660
been a little bit more tempered than it

201
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,220
might be I mean the thing that I think

202
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,080
is the most valuable lesson Ukraine

203
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,180
shows you you can achieve a level of

204
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,340
cyber resiliency if you're willing to

205
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,220
Pivot to a different model

206
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,139
and I one of the things I hope that

207
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,940
comes out of this very unfortunate

208
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,759
conflict is can we learn from this and

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,620
say to ourselves how do we create this

210
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,919
kind of resiliency within our structures

211
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,500
and let's not wait for an armed conflict

212
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,840
to force ourselves to think well maybe

213
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
we need to do things a little

214
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,680
differently I think what Ukraine shows

215
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,979
you from a cyber perspective is when you

216
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,479
integrate the commercial World

217
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,300
Government your citizens and you look at

218
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,340
this from our Global Perspective and you

219
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,139
get away from this idea of cyber

220
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,780
security is a methodology that's very

221
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,940
structured and formal hey we do patches

222
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,460
every Tuesday we don't patch except for

223
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,280
Tuesday that is just crazy to me and

224
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,419
Ukraine shows you you have to Pivot to a

225
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,340
very different model and security

226
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,860
requires continual change in investment

227
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,679
I also think it shows you is a guy who

228
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,539
spent a lot of time looking at the

229
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,458
Russians as a Target and also defending

230
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,779
against the Russians who are very

231
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,039
interested in

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
penetrating areas that I was responsible

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,320
from a defensive perspective as well

234
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,420
they seem to me to be very optimized for

235
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,399
Target sets that have low to moderate

236
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,680
levels of cyber security

237
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,260
that do not have high degrees of change

238
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,420
in their system architecture or their

239
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,060
approach to cyber security and they tend

240
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,620
to need time

241
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,120
to execute

242
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
and what you're seeing in Ukraine is the

243
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,779
target sets do not have low to average

244
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,700
level of preparedness there are a high

245
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,320
level of preparedness they got high

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,940
rates of change in their systems in

247
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,500
their architectures

248
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,660
and it's a very fluid and dynamic

249
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,700
environment so this idea that you're

250
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,680
going to get weeks and months

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
to do uh prepared Ops against a Target

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
set that's not going to change and that

253
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,740
really isn't paying much attention it's

254
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,720
just not what we're seeing thank you

255
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,360
Brad Smith said coming out of Davos and

256
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,060
coming in here that the last 12 months

257
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,980
have witnessed we've witnessed the most

258
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,680
vigorous aggressive and sustained and

259
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,660
destructive wave of cyber attacks and

260
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,660
history in Ukraine and the last one 12

261
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,519
months have also been the biggest

262
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,740
victory for defense in Cyber Technology

263
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,740
since the cyber security profession was

264
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,000
created

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,820
yesterday we heard from Sandra and the

266
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,140
Mandy and Google yeah hey but can I make

267
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,300
one quick do not fall in love with the

268
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
idea that technology is the end-all

269
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,120
be-all

270
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,220
that is not the differentiator in

271
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,680
Ukraine my argument would be you are not

272
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,180
saying in Dimitri and you guys might

273
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,040
have a different opinion you are not

274
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,959
seeing the application of some massive

275
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,880
new technology set that the world's

276
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,980
never seen before that's not how this is

277
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,720
playing out so I just I always get a

278
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
little leery when I hear people say well

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
it's all about the technical stuff yeah

280
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
precisely so Dimitri would you comment

281
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,300
on that a little bit I think you've been

282
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,360
a very uh clear spoken around that issue

283
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,220
and that it goes beyond the tech

284
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,959
you know I actually think one of the

285
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,640
biggest lessons at least for me from

286
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,560
this conflict has been

287
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,680
resiliency of humans and by the way that

288
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,060
goes for both sides of the conflict

289
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,100
there's a lot of assumptions being made

290
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,019
at the start of the war when the

291
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,339
sanctions and Export controls were

292
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,540
imposed in Russia that the Russian

293
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,339
economy would collapse it would be able

294
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,920
to procure semiconductors and all sorts

295
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,660
of things and that just proved to be

296
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,459
completely false because we actually

297
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,260
just put our report on that showing that

298
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,519
they've been able to compensate they've

299
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,779
been able to work around it they've been

300
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,220
able to try and ship through other

301
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,040
places get China to help Etc same thing

302
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,839
on the Ukrainian side right there were a

303
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,980
lot of people that assumed that

304
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,140
Ukrainian energy grid could not sustain

305
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,800
if we got cyber but a Relentless

306
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,380
non-stop attack with missiles and drones

307
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,260
against every substations in Ukraine

308
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,600
since October and yet power is still on

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,260
in Ukraine right humans are very

310
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,420
entrepreneurial in the face of great

311
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,019
adversity they find Solutions and that

312
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,880
is the lesson I think that applies both

313
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,220
in the Cyber domain and elsewhere yes

314
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,140
the you know Brad is right that the

315
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,820
Russians have launched tons of attacks

316
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,620
against ukrainians but you know what

317
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,140
when your kindergarten is getting bombed

318
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,120
you don't care that much that you may

319
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,940
not be able to use your ATM the list of

320
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,680
concerns and the priority of those

321
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,540
concerns changed dramatically when

322
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,480
you're in a conflict and you learn to

323
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,519
survive you want to survive I mean there

324
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,079
are ukrainians living right now without

325
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,620
water and electricity right so cyber is

326
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,380
like very low on the list of things that

327
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,940
they they tend to care about

328
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,860
um in in that part of the of the country

329
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,920
so it's all about resiliency and and I

330
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,480
think this is true by the way of any

331
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,740
country it's not specific to Ukraine

332
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,660
it's not specific to Russia any country

333
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,820
when faced with that type of adversity

334
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,100
finds a way to survive

335
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
that Hendrick shoe model that Dimitri's

336
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,000
outlined the sort of basic subsistence

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,620
rights which is where we are does that

338
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,300
suggest you Liesel that the the

339
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,459
rules-based liberal order is failing us

340
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,620
well absolutely not I would say and I

341
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,360
would the the comments that you made

342
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,720
earlier the quotes that you read about

343
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,540
um you know globalization is dead or

344
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,800
um I'm kind of glad I didn't read those

345
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
articles because I would be even more

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,240
depressed than I am about about the the

347
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,279
rhetoric that's out there but

348
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,420
um you know no one left Ukraine alone to

349
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,060
deal with this issue themselves

350
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,000
um so I would say that the the global

351
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,459
Community rallied behind them and I

352
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,980
think that was a very big surprise for

353
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,660
the Russians and that has pulled the

354
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,880
west and other

355
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,740
um what I'll call like-minded Partners

356
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,079
closer together than ever so I think it

357
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,000
totally debunks the idea that there's

358
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,100
not a global order or there's not a

359
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,360
global

360
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,100
um

361
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,620
Cadre of of countries and others willing

362
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,500
to stand up countries private sector who

363
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,579
have you know gone out of their normal

364
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:27,060
construct of contract uh capability to

365
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,260
help ukrainians so I would say that you

366
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,839
know absolutely the global World Order

367
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,600
is there I would also say that there are

368
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,899
rules in this space we have set up a

369
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,260
construct for what is acceptable and

370
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,600
what isn't and you know we made those

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,680
rules in the context of the what we call

372
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,000
the framework of responsible State

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,180
behavior in cyberspace and it set out

374
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,980
the things that you could not do and it

375
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,540
showed that the applicability of

376
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,600
existing international law applies to

377
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,880
cyberspace so while we may make the

378
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
distinction that that this is not

379
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,500
necessarily just cyber it's not

380
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,200
necessarily just

381
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,760
that there is an integrated approach to

382
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,100
this the part of the integration is the

383
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,620
fact that the existing law applies and

384
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,980
the second thing is we you know some

385
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,779
countries have broken the rules that

386
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,300
they signed up to do and so we have

387
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,220
called them out for break taking those

388
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,560
rules so I'd say the global World Order

389
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,139
is there some we and we need to double

390
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,060
down on it you know Dimitri's commented

391
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,260
in the past I think one of the things we

392
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,000
heard from um one of the panelists

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,880
yesterday was correlating the Cyber

394
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,220
related events to the kinetic events on

395
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,180
the ground and the troop movements

396
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,220
within Ukraine that's important for a

397
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,660
variety of reasons softening the

398
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,839
battlefield Etc but also from that Norm

399
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,160
standpoint that you're referencing

400
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,100
liaison we know that the ukrainians are

401
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,199
very interested in investigating and

402
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,240
potentially even Prosecuting war crimes

403
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,459
and we know that under the war crimes

404
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,260
International laws as opposed to the

405
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,380
laws of armed conflict that the pictures

406
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,300
and the photographs and the

407
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,680
documentation and the evidence

408
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,899
associated with troop movements and

409
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,360
targets if those are correlated that can

410
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,000
be a defense to the war crime charge but

411
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,860
if they're uncorrelated that can

412
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,420
actually bring the charge so if they hit

413
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,399
a water system that's decoupled from

414
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,720
kinetic movement you've been

415
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,519
commentating on these issues around the

416
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,320
relevance of cyber Dimitri maybe a

417
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,000
little bit more at and what we should

418
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,320
expect in the near term in the longer

419
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,120
term in Ukraine and then we'll turn to

420
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,160
the next topic

421
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,019
well

422
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,959
I do fear that we are

423
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,000
potentially reaching a Tipping Point

424
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,639
I think that the allies and there's been

425
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,800
a lot of criticism of the slow supply of

426
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,560
weapons to Ukraine and and certainly has

427
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,820
caused death and destruction in Ukraine

428
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,980
but I think that the slow bowling

429
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,500
boiling of the Frog by the Allies on the

430
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,560
provision of weapons has been very

431
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
strategic

432
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,860
some of it has been tactical because

433
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,260
there's only so much you can do at once

434
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,300
and training the ukrainians inside of

435
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,220
Apple logistics for all the systems

436
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,620
we're providing is also not an easy task

437
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,459
but Summit was designed specifically to

438
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,740
avoid escalation right imagine if all of

439
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,779
the things we have now provide to the

440
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,000
ukrainians starting with the high Mars

441
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,339
and the armored vehicles and the tanks

442
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,519
and the Patriot batteries and other

443
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,079
anti-aircraft

444
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,120
defenses has been provided on day one of

445
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,079
the war

446
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,180
that almost certainly would have caused

447
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,639
Russia to respond right politically they

448
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,040
you know Putin would not have uh been

449
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,500
able to just let that slide but the fact

450
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,820
that we spread it out over the course of

451
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,279
a year has prevented him from having

452
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,040
that one moment where you're gonna

453
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,160
decide to escalate vis-a-vis NATO and

454
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
you know are you really going to do it

455
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,639
over 10 Challenger tanks in the UK right

456
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,300
um that has been uh I think one of the

457
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,040
understated successes of the western

458
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
approach here but I do worry that

459
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
cumulatively we're starting to reach a

460
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,480
Tipping Point

461
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,400
where you know when you look at subtle

462
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
and some not so subtle signs coming out

463
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,419
of Moscow

464
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,919
um they're getting increasingly worried

465
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,540
and you know now with the taco fighter

466
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,400
jets Etc

467
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,599
um they're worried about losing a

468
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,579
strategic advantage and that may cause

469
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,959
them to

470
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,339
say

471
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,280
um or send a message rather that they've

472
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,020
had enough and and that they're not

473
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,480
going to take it anymore so we may see

474
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,299
that in in various forms we may see that

475
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,600
in a form of a kinetic covert most

476
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,220
likely attack on NATO

477
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,900
a small one you know perhaps in Ammo

478
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,000
Depot and in Poland or whatever to send

479
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,760
a message or we may see that in in terms

480
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,580
of a cyber retaliation as well or both

481
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,299
against uh NATO infrastructure so you

482
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,280
know I think a lot of people myself

483
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,380
included have thought that the Russians

484
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,480
would respond in cyber

485
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,160
um to the sanctions and the export

486
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
controls that have been put in place on

487
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,340
them there's been very little that

488
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,260
against the West uh but the risk I think

489
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,380
is is certainly not gone away and could

490
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,840
actually be getting higher based on uh

491
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,220
what we're seeing right now in the

492
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,059
conflict

493
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,340
so with that framing of that long-term

494
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,780
conflict and continued potential

495
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,320
escalation let's let's turn to China

496
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,559
um so while that's running in parallel

497
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,120
that same article Zero Sum from the

498
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,520
economists in speaking about China said

499
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,740
economic conflict with China looks

500
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,380
increasingly inevitable as China became

501
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,120
more deeply integrated in the global

502
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,760
economy at the turn of the century many

503
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,919
in the west predicted it would become

504
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,320
more democratic

505
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,480
economic engagement brings liberal

506
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,059
democracy the death of that hope

507
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,000
combined with the migration of a million

508
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
manufacturing jobs to Chinese factories

509
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,160
caused America to fall out of love with

510
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,840
globalization

511
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,520
Dimitri let's start again with you on

512
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,919
China maybe set the table where we are

513
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,720
where are we with Taiwan and certainly

514
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,100
the work you've been doing recently with

515
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,140
the chips Act and the issues attended to

516
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,220
that

517
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,960
well I think another lesson from last

518
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,559
year is that we need to start

519
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,780
expecting that Unthinkable things may

520
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,820
become thinkable and may actually occur

521
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,039
and

522
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,500
um I worry a great deal that

523
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,039
China would decide to move on Taiwan

524
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
uh this decade and

525
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,660
that would make the conflict over

526
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,820
Ukraine look like a nothing Burger

527
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,000
because you now have the President Biden

528
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
on four occasions explicitly say that

529
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,220
he's going to send American troops to

530
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,020
defend Taiwan

531
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,960
uh a war with China there appears to be

532
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,240
a lot of confusion about that yeah no I

533
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,679
mean it was very explicit on 60 Minutes

534
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,780
he was asked directly the question would

535
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,580
American troops fight for we'll fight

536
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,500
China for Taiwan he said yes

537
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
fourth time he said that on the record

538
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,340
so

539
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,240
um

540
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,419
and and clearly the in Congress you're

541
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,559
seeing

542
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,360
um focus on that you're seeing the

543
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,200
defense department preparing for that uh

544
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,299
eventuality and you have President XI

545
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,660
also making it very clear that Taiwan

546
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,179
will become part of China

547
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,880
um peacefully or not and there's no

548
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,679
Prospect of it becoming peacefully part

549
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,900
of China in the foreseeable future and

550
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,179
he also said recently that he's not

551
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:33,419
going to let this problem as he calls it

552
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,539
um go on festered uh and and be passed

553
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,340
in the Next Generation Now president

554
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,360
she's turning 70 this the summer so

555
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,240
Mr death waits for no one and he's

556
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,160
certainly acutely aware of that so the

557
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,220
the the timeline I think is is that

558
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,320
should be the takeaway Mr death Waits

559
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,360
for No One

560
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,760
um and the guns

561
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,919
uh so so I I think the the concern is is

562
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,480
huge and it would change everything

563
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,580
right I mean you know people talk about

564
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,500
the dependence economic dependency on

565
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,780
China trying to be in a big Market all

566
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,160
that will go out the window

567
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,260
when Americans are dying by the

568
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,600
thousands defending Taiwan and let's be

569
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,820
clear there'll be lots of casualties and

570
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,940
uh strikes on American soil are not out

571
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,880
of the question if we decide to actually

572
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,919
Strike Chinese air bases on the mainland

573
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,400
which we may want to do because uh if we

574
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,039
don't uh uh a lot more American soldiers

575
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,080
will die in the Pacific as the animal

576
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,580
knows very well

577
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,000
so this this is a conflict that we need

578
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,179
to avoid at all costs and part of that

579
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,480
is is focusing on how do we deter China

580
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,299
how do we increase our leverage over

581
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,400
China and decrease their leverage over

582
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,700
us to me does it you know the work

583
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,740
um Dimitri that you did to accelerate

584
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,659
the chips act in the United States

585
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,820
through the Silverado accelerator and

586
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,559
then yesterday we had a great panel

587
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,080
discussion where one of the panelists uh

588
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,640
highlighted the efforts here in Germany

589
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,620
and in Europe more generally to promote

590
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,720
chip production here do we think that

591
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,900
the Dutch asml

592
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,460
Japan's Tokyo electron do we think the

593
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,159
work that the U.S government did with

594
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,440
their foreign counterparts to ensure

595
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,059
that there was a collaborative approach

596
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,980
to dealing with China chip acquisition

597
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,260
is that tinkering with Machinery or is

598
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,340
it going to have a material impact to

599
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,140
kind of increase that leverage I think

600
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,940
it's having a huge effect I mean making

601
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,919
no mistake about it the goal of the

602
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,960
policy coming out of the United States

603
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,520
coming out of Washington

604
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,860
both on the chips act and more

605
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,299
explicitly on the export controls that

606
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,520
were announced in October is to destroy

607
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,740
China's Advanced semiconductor industry

608
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,080
and it's having that effect because

609
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,880
Chinese semiconductor industry is

610
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,500
completely dependent on Western

611
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,780
Equipment Western technology in many

612
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
cases even Western citizens a lot of the

613
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,760
people that are working in the Chinese

614
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,640
semiconductor industry may have been

615
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,840
born in China but hold American

616
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
passports and want to keep those

617
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,860
American passports so our Leverage is

618
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,340
immense in that space and those efforts

619
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,860
are designed to enhance it Mike you've

620
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,320
been a student of the Chinese in Taiwan

621
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,419
situation for a very long time and from

622
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,580
your old perch and your current perch uh

623
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,020
you were just traveling obviously we're

624
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,000
at Davos and then you were in in Saudi

625
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,159
how do you see that leverage calculation

626
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,780
that Dimitri's articulated for us have

627
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,280
we increased our leverage collectively

628
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,260
and globally through our through

629
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,960
multi-party multilateral arrangements or

630
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,360
even bilats or where we're better than

631
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,039
we were but we're not where we need to

632
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,980
be is is what I would say I said look as

633
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,600
you said we spent 20 years trying to

634
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
focus the idea of could we make societal

635
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,059
and Democratic changes and when you

636
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,679
strip it all away that was the focus

637
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,020
that clearly has failed and my view is

638
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,120
guys that's not going to happen that is

639
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,980
just not China's history and it's not

640
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,780
where it's going to go so let's not

641
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,820
waste a lot of time on that objective I

642
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,059
think now what is shaping at least on

643
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,940
the U.S side is we're now in an era

644
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,280
where we have decided we need to create

645
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,340
and sustain competitive advantage

646
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,960
whether that's from an economic

647
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
perspective or a military perspective

648
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,919
and ships have been kind of the initial

649
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,559
area that we focused now under President

650
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,820
Trump and I worked for both president

651
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,620
Trump and President Obama and at one

652
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,179
point in my career I was the senior

653
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,580
intelligence officer in the dod out in

654
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,620
the Pacific so I was very focused on the

655
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,100
war plan coordinating with Taipei Seoul

656
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,419
Tokyo Canberra Etc so I lived this for

657
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,179
several years every day

658
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,260
um

659
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,539
we've created a strategy now that is

660
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,940
very focused on can we achieve a broader

661
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,460
set of international partners

662
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,860
to address violations of norms of

663
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,360
behavior the South China Sea probably

664
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,159
being the poster child in many ways for

665
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,120
this

666
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,640
where we haven't had as much success yet

667
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,659
as

668
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,240
we've been I I think we need to be very

669
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,860
careful from the U.S perspective I'm not

670
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,240
saying we're doing it but I am very

671
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,100
mindful I hear this everywhere I go in

672
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,900
the world I'll be in Australia when I

673
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,140
leave here tomorrow

674
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,140
don't make us choose between you and

675
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,220
China

676
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,500
that this is not good for us we're in a

677
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,480
different economic relationship and I I

678
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,520
like the fact that the U.S to date has

679
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,980
not gone down that road because if we do

680
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,020
I think that's going to create some

681
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,299
perhaps and perhaps people make choices

682
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,880
we may not like where I personally by

683
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,740
the way Mike Germany was saying the same

684
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,960
thing about Russia until very recently

685
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,320
so yeah but Tuesday will have to if War

686
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,059
breaks out now that brings to my next

687
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,080
point where I was going to say where

688
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,820
it's the greatest frustration I would

689
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,580
argue is the US and Europe clearly are

690
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,960
not synchronized here

691
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,760
now it doesn't mean we have to totally

692
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,020
agree with each other and it doesn't

693
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,360
mean that we totally have to adopt the

694
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,340
same policies but you're gonna you use

695
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,380
the example I was going to use you look

696
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,760
at the choice for example that the

697
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,559
Germans made with no disrespect to my

698
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,779
German host but sometimes you make

699
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,640
choices that make sense from an economic

700
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,260
perspective but they set you up for

701
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,480
strategic challenges down the road and

702
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,740
my argument would be you are living

703
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,900
through an energy choice that was made

704
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,299
decades ago and now you're seeing how

705
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,580
this plays out and has placed Europe in

706
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,740
an environment that is not optimal and

707
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,200
has forced painful moves to try to

708
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,360
correct it my view would be don't get

709
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,279
yourself in the same position with China

710
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,320
and clearly the the current German

711
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,020
leader is including this week during the

712
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,539
MSC meetings and the mcsc meetings and

713
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,880
the side bilats and multi-lap meetings

714
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,980
are holding are recognizing that and

715
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,299
moving in that direction right with

716
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,860
their work with Poland their work here

717
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,600
with other allies in Europe and their

718
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,880
work with the United States so exactly

719
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,100
Lisa over to you first going back to

720
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,260
Dimitri's point then the second uh point

721
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,500
that was just made by by Mike

722
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,020
you mentioned earlier that not all the

723
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,880
players who have subscribed to the rule

724
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,679
set where they signed into the agreement

725
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,360
to the treaty are following the rules is

726
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,659
China a normative based system such that

727
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,220
they will follow the rules are they

728
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,480
following the rules should we expect

729
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,460
them to follow the rules and then over

730
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,320
on Mike's Point as well

731
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,059
so well I guess the first thing to say

732
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,340
is that you know the the framework that

733
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,380
I mentioned is not a treaty and it's

734
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,960
importantly not a treaty because it

735
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,000
would take us I don't know 40 50 years

736
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,159
to negotiate one and then some countries

737
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,260
wouldn't abide by it anyway

738
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,159
um but it but it does set up a set of

739
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,360
accepted Behavior both that uh the

740
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,760
countries restrain themselves from doing

741
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,039
certain things but also take steps to to

742
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,600
do other things like protect themselves

743
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,720
resilience thing uh things like that

744
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,559
that

745
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,100
um set up the framework for then to be

746
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,720
able to hold States accountable when

747
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,299
they I guess transgress it but which is

748
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,279
what I want to pick up on Dimitri's

749
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,080
comment about deterrence with regard to

750
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,360
China how do we deter China

751
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,440
um you know you could we have had a

752
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,640
philosophy a project of finding ways to

753
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,860
change the decision calculus of those

754
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,220
that would decide to take action because

755
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,760
in cyberspace against other states and

756
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,419
that has included so far the collective

757
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,480
efforts that we've had to call a state

758
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,960
out politically publicly politically for

759
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,500
transgressing that normative framework

760
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,940
that is one thing that sanctions are

761
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,380
another a way to hopefully change the

762
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,740
decision calculus but I think we have to

763
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,480
be careful that what we do to try to

764
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,340
deter Russia is different than what we

765
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,860
might do to deter China because they

766
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,260
look at things from a completely from a

767
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,080
different lens that doesn't mean that we

768
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,400
shouldn't do some of the same things

769
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,960
with regard to helping to build

770
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,140
resilience in cyberspace sharing

771
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,539
information

772
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,039
galvanizing and leveraging the private

773
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,960
sector in both cases which I guess it's

774
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
a little bit to the economic piece that

775
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,460
you're talking about

776
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,080
so that some of the things we need to do

777
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,419
are the same but we also need to realize

778
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,159
that what is going to trigger one thing

779
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,740
or another one either China or Russia or

780
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,360
the other two

781
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,539
um you know actors adversary actors in

782
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,340
cyberspace are different the other tool

783
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,539
that's smart about that yeah the other

784
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,700
tool with Dimitri mentioned that I would

785
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,320
hope you would comment on is

786
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,659
the disentanglement play right the

787
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,640
Chinese with pipl and the other laws

788
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,740
around privacy and cyber security that

789
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,240
they're using a really economic

790
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,919
entanglement place and or

791
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,840
disentanglement plays you know Martin

792
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,120
Wolfe just recently issued a book Martin

793
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,860
Wolf the writer from the financial times

794
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,080
one of the leading thinkers on the

795
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,120
liberal order these days his new book is

796
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,559
called the crisis of democratic

797
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,260
capitalism and he says in his book we're

798
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,539
now in a democratic recession core

799
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,779
Western countries in particular the U.S

800
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:51,840
is in that recession and I'm worried

801
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,120
um with the rise of entanglement due to

802
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,860
the rise of autocratic capitalist

803
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,840
Nations like China

804
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,880
um and the fact that U.S business and

805
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,440
the U.S government supported and

806
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,240
European governments supported that

807
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,159
entanglement and your example here in

808
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,860
Germany uh with the rise of an auto

809
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,039
autocrat capitalist in Russia can we

810
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,559
disentangle how effective what does that

811
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,659
take Dimitri's example on chips is

812
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,120
obviously one key example how how easily

813
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,640
can we disentangle with Dimitri

814
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,140
well look we're not talking about

815
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,299
complete decoupling right one that's not

816
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,659
possible and two not advantageous

817
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,640
um you know I think I think the lesson

818
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,440
that a lot of people had before Ukraine

819
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
is that if you have economic ties

820
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,799
between nations they won't go to war

821
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,500
history is uh full of examples where

822
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,600
that's not the case World War one being

823
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,159
one of the biggest Britain and Germany

824
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,020
had a lot of trade increasing trade

825
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,960
prior to 1914 but also of course Russia

826
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,980
Ukraine

827
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,100
um a situation as well but no ties is

828
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,440
also incredibly dangerous right again

829
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,740
the focus is to be precise and to

830
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,960
increase leverage right the goal of our

831
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,360
export control policy on chips is not to

832
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,059
prevent sale of all trips to China that

833
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,320
would devastate their economy that would

834
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,760
say the global economy would blow back

835
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,520
on us the goal is first and foremost to

836
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,700
prevent them from manufacturing chips

837
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,260
particularly van strips so that they

838
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,000
would buy it it would be dependent on us

839
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,980
right so that that would depend that

840
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,500
dependency would deepen

841
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,440
um and hopefully would play a role in an

842
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,659
overall deterrent effect should they

843
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:25,799
decide to

844
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,500
move on Taiwan so we need to find more

845
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,960
of those leverage points and vice versa

846
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,480
where they currently think that we are

847
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,980
completely dependent on them for example

848
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,919
on rare Earths we need to make sure that

849
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,600
we're diversifying our supply and

850
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,179
production of those materials so that

851
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,460
they don't think that if they go for

852
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,679
Taiwan will be so constrained that we'll

853
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:47,820
not be able to respond it's a really

854
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,260
important Point you're making which is

855
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,480
not decoupling but changing the way

856
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,940
we're coupled it is I would say

857
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,559
strategic decoupling that is not

858
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,460
completely it's trying to remove

859
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,860
strategic dependencies in many ways so

860
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,120
Mike

861
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,279
um I mean I agree that to me decoupling

862
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,620
is it's totally unworkable it's not

863
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,840
sustainable it doesn't it's totally

864
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,419
ineffective the the challenge to me is

865
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,340
look what a rules-based order provides

866
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,980
is predictability stability and

867
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,340
engenders cooperation economic growth

868
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,320
and has resulted in a world broadly if

869
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,000
you look in the last 70 years the world

870
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,940
is historically compared to look at it

871
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,000
over time as imperfect as it is

872
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,899
lower loss of lice less global conflict

873
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,360
and significant economic growth and

874
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,340
activity on a global basis not just one

875
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,740
or two Nations but on a global basis

876
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,240
so I think we're trying to ask ourselves

877
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,460
how do we sustain that

878
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,260
and how do we do that

879
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,120
particularly one some Nations

880
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,100
particularly you know I would argue

881
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,419
Russia and China tend to be ordering

882
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,120
along this line their view is

883
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
that the the inherent National Security

884
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,559
interests of a particular Nation Trump

885
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,679
in some instances this rules-based order

886
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,059
and we're not talking about the right of

887
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,279
imminent self-defense Russia's invasion

888
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,380
of Ukraine is not an application of the

889
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,899
right of self-defense

890
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,200
um and that's the rub at the moment it's

891
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,000
about how do you apply your power as a

892
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,140
nation do you do it within this

893
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,820
framework with these Norms of behavior

894
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,279
that allow us to address issues but to

895
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,779
potentially do it in a way that helps to

896
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,580
diffuse crisis or do you believe that

897
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,960
it's about the application of power

898
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,700
against your core interest and that's

899
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,260
what really matters to me that's what

900
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,580
we're seeing and we're seeing that in

901
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,679
Europe you're proving durable challenged

902
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,260
by this in in Ukraine challenged by the

903
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,440
issues in in China but certainly durable

904
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,260
these relationships uh let's let's pull

905
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,399
the lens back and then we're gonna go to

906
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,360
questions

907
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,659
um let's fast forward to 2050. uh

908
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,240
experts are predicting that by 2050

909
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,000
India Indonesia they're going to be the

910
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,500
world's third and fourth largest

911
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,640
economies

912
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,799
they will be digital economies

913
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,860
what does that mean for this order does

914
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,720
the liberal order the Democratic liberal

915
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,360
order continue is it durable through

916
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,880
that type of development and Rise are we

917
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,380
going to continue to see the rise of

918
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,019
autocratic capitalist Nations what's

919
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,580
that conflict look like you start with

920
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,080
you Mike

921
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,300
well always be leery as a performer

922
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,800
professional intelligent individual I

923
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,300
used to tell my bosses I think I'm

924
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,859
pretty good at like five to ten years

925
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,379
once we start to get be out 10 years let

926
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,699
me just be very upfront with you Mr

927
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,260
President I'm not sure well take us

928
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,000
through the trend line okay just take us

929
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,960
through the trend line what's it going

930
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,000
to look like but I I like to meet you

931
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,560
I'm a big fan of history in terms of how

932
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
can you apply insights for the past

933
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,719
the global order is seeing significant

934
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,719
changes in economic up and downs over

935
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,139
the course of the last few centuries

936
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,480
um and so I personally believe that we

937
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,099
can continue like for example it never

938
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,719
bothered me well what if China is the

939
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,399
biggest economy in the world I'm like

940
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,619
that enough itself is not

941
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,300
something that inherently I say oh

942
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,800
that's inherently evil I care about

943
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,099
behavior and choices

944
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,800
um as we look at how I think the next 10

945
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,140
years to the mid-century is going to

946
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,520
play out

947
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,920
clearly you're going to see changes in

948
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,359
the economic structure as of today

949
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,560
you're going to see The Rise of Nations

950
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,260
that are the mid economic level who are

951
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,240
going to gain bigger India Brazil

952
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,780
Indonesia probably being the three most

953
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,700
visible but I also remind people look

954
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,820
history shows you it's seldom is just a

955
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,220
linear progression there's always zigzag

956
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,200
there's always challenges there always

957
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,900
is the unanticipated and for example

958
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,180
those who would say to me well China's

959
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,980
doing this I'm saying well I suspect

960
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,020
it's not going to be quite as linear as

961
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,240
we think it's going to be if history is

962
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,240
any guide there's always challenges and

963
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,800
I don't pretend to know what those

964
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,660
challenges are but if we create this

965
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,240
rules-based structure the right way we

966
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,160
can respond to those changes we can

967
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,320
assimilate those changes we can in fact

968
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,320
turn them to a broader Collective good

969
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,359
that that's what I'm interested in not

970
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,300
Rises that lead to disruption and end up

971
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,980
blowing things apart that's not where we

972
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,420
want to be to me Liesel

973
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,680
well your question reminds if I may

974
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,640
digress for a moment there was a time

975
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,280
no I'm going to quote myself

976
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
um I can't quote a book but um years ago

977
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,700
I uh I applied to join the U.S foreign

978
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,500
service and I'm not in the Foreign

979
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,180
Service now for

980
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,700
um I'm in the civil service but it was

981
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,619
the first time the foreign service exam

982
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,440
had a an essay option

983
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,480
and I think that's the only reason I

984
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,800
passed I'm not so good at multiple

985
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,220
choice but the um the the list of 20

986
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,660
questions that we were able to answer

987
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,060
and this was in the mid 90s one of them

988
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:45,540
was by 2020 now will uh China's uh

989
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,760
um supersede the us as the world's

990
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,740
greatest power and you had I don't know

991
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,420
30 minutes to write you know five

992
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,660
paragraphs I wrote that they would

993
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,640
because it was easier for me to back

994
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,240
that up I hope that I am wrong about

995
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,119
that for 2050 but I agree with Mike that

996
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,300
it's not a zero-sum game it's not as

997
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,540
linear as he that you know it is that my

998
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,180
that theory might describe and I think

999
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,460
it applies to the India and Indonesians

1000
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,800
of the world as well they do have many

1001
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,839
more people but they have many more

1002
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,940
complicating factors as well that I

1003
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,240
think are going to get in their own way

1004
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,359
for becoming a uh superpower in the same

1005
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,859
way and I probably wouldn't write that

1006
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:33,000
essay today but Dimitri

1007
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,859
no I I agree with all of that I think

1008
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,460
a lot can happen before 2050 and again

1009
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,599
hopefully this conflict with China will

1010
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,520
not emerge but if it does it will change

1011
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,560
everything as I mentioned it will impact

1012
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,540
every country on the planet in in very

1013
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,540
dramatic ways so um really impossible to

1014
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,660
to look at the lawn history like that

1015
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,780
but I'll just say that population is not

1016
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,160
the only Factor

1017
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,260
and there are many reasons why the

1018
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,640
United States became the predominant

1019
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,980
superpower population was just one of

1020
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,300
those

1021
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,339
um the fact that we had you know huge

1022
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,520
land mass very secure one oceans on both

1023
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,640
sides uh played a big role in that the

1024
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,640
fact that we focus on the US Navy uh

1025
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,079
protecting the trains unsolicited

1026
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,540
unsolicited uh protecting the trade

1027
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,460
routes around the world that helped our

1028
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,320
economic growth was really important so

1029
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't see some of those countries

1030
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,980
investing in those capabilities they may

1031
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,200
later on but

1032
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,740
um

1033
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,900
there could be many ways amazing in

1034
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,599
which their growth may be impacted

1035
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,119
thank you well let's now take some

1036
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,560
questions from the audience if we have

1037
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,540
any

1038
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,020
yes sir

1039
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,160
yes sir

1040
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,279
thank you

1041
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,940
thank you very much my name is I'm a

1042
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,980
retired Professor from the University of

1043
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,680
aus my question is what about the role

1044
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,200
of the United Nations in the future so

1045
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,140
the U.N plans uh Global Summit on the

1046
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,680
future in 2024 it plans to draft a

1047
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,740
global digital compact the Secretary

1048
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,140
General of the United Nations has a

1049
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,320
roadmap on digital cooperation but here

1050
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,480
we see conflicts where the United

1051
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,700
Nations has rather powerless is there a

1052
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,339
future for the United Nations in 2050

1053
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,500
the one thing I'm very confident in is

1054
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,940
that the United Nations are pretty

1055
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,859
relevant

1056
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,560
irrelevant irrelevant so we have one

1057
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,900
vote for no I mean I think the U.N will

1058
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,060
still be here 50 years from now I I

1059
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,800
think the challenge is how do you make

1060
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,740
it more relevant or is the structure so

1061
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,900
fundamentally flawed it can't be I like

1062
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,940
to be an optimist well let's take that

1063
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,920
into the gge as well take it to today

1064
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,020
first and then the initiatives that you

1065
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,060
you mentioned Professor we had a gge

1066
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,180
process for cyber we had a process

1067
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,400
around these normal centers uh yes this

1068
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,839
is the intergovernmental working group

1069
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,180
originally around 11 countries bumped up

1070
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,339
to 13 the Russians and the Chinese were

1071
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,140
part of that effectively boycotting a

1072
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,119
lot of the initiatives and then moved up

1073
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,180
to 20 countries uh on cooperation Lisa

1074
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,040
what are your thoughts on the the

1075
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,140
current GG process where we stand and

1076
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,400
then whether or not the UN is going to

1077
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,020
play a relevant role going forward in

1078
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,920
the order

1079
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,320
well I guess um there's a lot to unpack

1080
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,260
there Wolfgang but um but you know

1081
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,420
keeping in mind that the gge process and

1082
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,520
now the open-ended working group you

1083
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,680
know that moved it from the 25 countries

1084
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,160
that were sort of eventually in the gge

1085
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,200
um successfully concluded the sixth

1086
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,540
round to come up you know sort of uh

1087
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,339
finalize and affirm the framework that I

1088
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,140
was talking about earlier and set up

1089
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,880
another process for discussing what

1090
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
might what implementation of this

1091
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,020
framework might be

1092
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,480
um but keeping in mind that it really

1093
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,940
GGO only deals with State on state

1094
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,619
Behavior

1095
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,420
what we're talking about in the terms of

1096
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,200
global digital Compact and the future I

1097
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
mean you know the Secretary General is

1098
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,920
has been very Visionary in all those

1099
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,099
regards but they also Encompass the

1100
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,560
actions activity and

1101
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,640
um

1102
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,940
innovation of those that are not States

1103
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,200
if you're talking about digital

1104
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,900
cooperation and we're talking about uh

1105
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,320
digitalization it's going to include

1106
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,820
companies the private sector Civil

1107
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,680
Society technicians and that's where I

1108
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,040
think the UN is is challenged in trying

1109
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,599
setting

1110
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,740
um a path forward especially if they

1111
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,440
are Irrelevant for bringing if they

1112
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,240
remain Irrelevant for bringing those um

1113
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,839
multi-stakeholders

1114
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,839
Community into the discussions in a

1115
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,640
place where only governments can

1116
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,099
negotiate the outcome

1117
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,099
um I'll be interested to see where this

1118
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,760
Global digital compact uh goes in the

1119
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,859
course of the next process for those

1120
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,260
that don't know Rwanda and Sweden are

1121
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,140
the co-facilitators for that for that

1122
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,900
process and what it comes out with it

1123
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,280
will have I think a sense of

1124
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,140
recommendation but it's not going to be

1125
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,200
you know a dispositive for the for the

1126
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,880
whole Community I think we have another

1127
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,400
question here we

1128
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,660
let's go here if we can I think we've

1129
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,099
got time for two more quick questions I

1130
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,000
think thank you

1131
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,440
hi Fran Burwell of the Atlantic Council

1132
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,599
and McLarty Associates I wanted to kind

1133
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,579
of put cyber security back into this

1134
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,079
discussion because it's really focused

1135
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,280
on geopolitics and uh um

1136
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,440
how much does the success at moderating

1137
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,900
cyber security attacks or the failure to

1138
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,160
grab hold of that change your prognostic

1139
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,420
prognostications for the future and the

1140
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,880
trend lines that you see especially as

1141
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,920
we all see our societies becoming more

1142
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,420
digital

1143
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,920
Mike

1144
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,380
so to me we're approaching a point where

1145
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,260
the pain that uh that is created is

1146
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,960
unsustainable the economic impact

1147
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,520
efficiency

1148
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,160
Etc and the fact that quite frankly we

1149
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,140
haven't seen the worst of this yet

1150
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,760
both in terms of what's in the realm of

1151
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,540
possibility the level of activity so

1152
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,500
it's one reason why I look to the future

1153
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,119
we have got to come up with a broader

1154
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,380
structure for how we're going to address

1155
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,720
this this is where the the very start of

1156
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,640
this thing works against us this started

1157
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,960
with a no controls no restraints it grew

1158
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,420
you know on its own and my view is hey

1159
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,220
that was great when we started this when

1160
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,140
we created this but as we look at the

1161
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,579
scale and the integration of these

1162
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,260
capabilities and the foundational

1163
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,240
elements they are that's not a

1164
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,700
sustainable approach anymore to me and

1165
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,040
if we don't address this I'm concerned

1166
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,680
that the future in some ways could be a

1167
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,839
lot worse than it needs to be from a

1168
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,660
cyber security perspective

1169
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,280
and all that thank you friend great

1170
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,119
question one last question

1171
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,420
and I hope around that the the frame

1172
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,940
we're giving sort of five clicks up is

1173
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,380
precisely for that point to put the

1174
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,520
other panels in context

1175
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,200
Estonian civil servant currently an

1176
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,140
academic in Berlin and my question is

1177
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,380
about Ukraine and the integration of

1178
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,960
cyber elements into the actual

1179
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,540
conventional Warfare and and the lessons

1180
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,940
learned from Ukraine I think this um

1181
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,400
what we have seen offers us a unique

1182
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,460
opportunity also to integrate more of

1183
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,940
those lessons to our Western NATO EU

1184
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,440
National strategies

1185
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,640
so

1186
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,560
um maybe I will direct the question to

1187
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,400
Dmitry and Mike so if you would maybe

1188
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,500
make free recommendations

1189
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,180
to officials in Brussels and also in

1190
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,819
capitals who have to be now a bit more

1191
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,440
geopolitical than they used to be in

1192
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,839
Europe so what would be those three

1193
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,780
recommendations based um from what you

1194
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,240
have seen in Ukraine it is true I'll do

1195
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,579
one okay you go first no you're not I

1196
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:06,720
know you're not asking me because I'm

1197
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,160
with the state with the government so I

1198
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,480
know that's why why don't we do one each

1199
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,819
Lisa why don't you answer one I'm saving

1200
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:14,240
Liesel because she's a Vista government

1201
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,180
but he can of course say that at a at a

1202
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,680
military level I'll talk is it from a

1203
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,660
military perspective and it goes to

1204
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,000
something Dimitri started with you have

1205
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,760
got to integrate cyber into your broader

1206
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,220
Warfare warfighting scheme of maneuver

1207
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,020
and I'm watching the Russians and I'm

1208
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,640
going guys you are not integrating this

1209
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,040
well and I say that as a guy who is

1210
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,839
commander of cyber command I was very

1211
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:40,319
focused and um man we did some amazing

1212
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,359
things tactically on the battlefields in

1213
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,520
Iraq in Syria for example with how we

1214
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,440
align cyber with the broader activity

1215
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,880
cities that were occurring in the battle

1216
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,440
space to really cause Major Impact on

1217
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,540
Isis on the ground and I just don't see

1218
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,819
the Russians doing that in the same way

1219
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
I guess I'll just say I'm answering but

1220
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,920
not answering yes but one thing that we

1221
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,339
do need to remember is that we as a

1222
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,339
government do not need to think of

1223
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:15,420
um cyber as a response to cyber or you

1224
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,520
know it's not that that one-to-one

1225
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,800
necessarily every time and I think using

1226
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,660
all the tools considering all the tools

1227
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,839
of National Power to deal with

1228
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,579
the things that are coming at you

1229
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,740
whether integrated or not you know you

1230
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,540
have to consider each of those tools and

1231
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,520
I so I hesitate when people talk about

1232
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,520
oh if it's a Cyber attack or cyber

1233
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,319
situation it needs to be responded to by

1234
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:39,960
cyber that's not necessarily the case

1235
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,900
you know the United States military is a

1236
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,220
very unique organization on the planet

1237
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,560
because it's the only military that

1238
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,300
plans to fight pretty much any conflict

1239
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,920
out there

1240
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,099
um and against any Foe and we spend an

1241
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,200
enormous amount of money and resources

1242
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,780
uh developing that capability no one

1243
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,060
else on the planet comes close and what

1244
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,099
you're seeing in Ukraine actually from

1245
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,720
the Russian failure perspective is an

1246
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,220
example of that it's not that the

1247
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,480
Russians are weak at everything it's

1248
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,540
that they never plan to fight a war that

1249
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,400
they're fighting in Ukraine they always

1250
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,780
thought that they would engage with NATO

1251
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,640
they would use their ballistic missiles

1252
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,800
or nuclear deterrence capabilities and

1253
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,859
and other Naval capabilities

1254
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:24,900
um to uh respond to conflict with NATO

1255
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,700
Ukraine was a very different Battlefield

1256
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,740
and their suffering and one of the

1257
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,480
biggest failures has been the inability

1258
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,520
to establish air dominance over the

1259
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,319
Skies of Ukraine the reason is that

1260
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,119
they've never invested and never planned

1261
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,180
for a suppression of enemy air defense's

1262
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,440
Mission which is an incredibly

1263
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,660
complicated and resource intensive

1264
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,040
capability

1265
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,420
and the reason they've never done that

1266
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,940
is because in a fight with NATO air

1267
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,740
defenses are not very relevant because

1268
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,599
NATO does not rely on air defenses

1269
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,760
relies on combat aircraft to establish

1270
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,859
its own air superiority so the Russians

1271
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,900
plan on an air to our combat which

1272
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,339
they're actually pretty good at they

1273
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,079
never planned on invading a country

1274
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,720
that's full of Soviet era enemy air

1275
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,220
defenses

1276
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,839
and

1277
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,240
um the lesson I think for Europe to take

1278
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,859
away from is

1279
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,980
are you going to develop and invest in

1280
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,579
all domain capability and all full

1281
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:19,920
counter capability like the United

1282
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,920
States which is an enormous investment

1283
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,140
or more likely

1284
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,880
are you going to realize that that is a

1285
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,079
resource investment that politically is

1286
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,440
not feasible and decide how you better

1287
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,079
integrate the various capabilities of of

1288
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,180
different nation states together

1289
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,960
to achieve the same effect right so does

1290
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,359
every nation in Europe need its own

1291
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,520
armor Force for example

1292
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,460
that is sufficient enough in terms of

1293
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,380
quantities and capabilities to actually

1294
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,380
matter or are you going to say one or

1295
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,460
two countries are going to invest in

1296
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,960
that another country is going to invest

1297
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,460
in cyber another country is going to

1298
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,460
invest in Naval capabilities and all

1299
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,040
together combine and integrate it is

1300
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,099
going to be a powerful force that is

1301
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,020
going to meet the requirements the

1302
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,900
security requirements of Europe and that

1303
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,180
would be my recommendation to Europeans

1304
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,800
is to start thinking about Collective

1305
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,200
defense in a way that's not about how do

1306
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,660
we do it all because reality is most

1307
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,040
countries in Europe just will not have

1308
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,480
the resources to do that so I think

1309
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
answering the question about who is in

1310
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,900
charge and the Blurred Lines

1311
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,240
responsibility one of the takeaways I

1312
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,800
hope from this panel for all of us thank

1313
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,660
you for the great questions to to

1314
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,880
generate additional conversation it's

1315
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,220
just that hey can I make one another

1316
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,480
we're going to have go ahead and make

1317
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,700
one other thing sure one of the

1318
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,319
takeaways of this should also be

1319
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:45,660
security is much broader than just the

1320
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,160
military dimension

1321
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,040
and security requires sustained

1322
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,859
investment and focus over time

1323
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,599
security is not something you focus on

1324
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:55,980
for a couple of years then you decide

1325
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,200

1326
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,060
