[Music]

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,660
sorry what a rush right great to have

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,000
you so please what a rush and I was just

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,220
told we only have another 10 minutes for

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,500
the fireside chat and there I was

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
telling Peter beforehand I want to have

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,340
you for at least half an hour because

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,340
you are because you are such a role

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,239
model to many of you of us you are a

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,879
force of nature

12
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,780
in as a politician as an expert but also

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,140
as a real knowledgeable person in the

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,260
field of cyber security issues and it's

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,879
really a great pleasure having you here

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
today at this high as I said

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,960
um there's a fire behind us the fires

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,199
are unimaginable

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,780
cyber fire and we want to make this um

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,760
insightful and maybe also a little bit

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,320
personal okay

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,979
um so um a year ago when we had these

23
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,200
discussions here we faced a very

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,119
different threat landscape or at least

25
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,240
we thought we faced a different you

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,820
thought well some of us thought um and

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,740
um and then the world has changed and

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,600
maybe you can tell us a little bit about

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,820
from your point of view how it has

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,860
changed and where we are going

31
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:39,720
a very very small question arriving to

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,180
this it was quite complicated to get

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,360
here I must say so

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,240
um I finally arrived but uh but must say

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,720
that when I was young I was a dancer and

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,000
that is really a good thing to change

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,060
your clothes in two minutes so so here I

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,560
am uh

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,740
um well it's a very broad question and I

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,920
think that before this war started we

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,659
all thought that the next war will be

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,818
you know cyber War but you don't really

43
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,580
need to go to the ground

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,200
because you can fight with the Cyber

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,959
tools really you can I mean years ago

46
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,140
hospitals only had to worry about

47
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,980
some drug addict coming and and stealing

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,360
your morphine but but today they are

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,140
also Target for cyber attacks and and

50
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,379
also in the Warfare there could be you

51
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,260
know civilian casualties if you if you

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,700
attack such

53
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,340
facilities and and it is true that while

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,680
we are very focused on the conventional

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,720
war that is going on there's also a

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,340
cyber war going on and we have seen uh

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,400
increase cyber attacks constantly we

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
increased our cyber budget already

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
before the war to make the foundations

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
really strong and and we see the attacks

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
every day so

62
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,840
um I think what we will see even if the

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,180
conventional war will end we will see

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,080
the cyber attacks continuing so we all

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,420
have to prepare for that so we have to

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,459
and I think this is the most important

67
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,700
thing the bad guys share information the

68
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,220
good guy shoots share information too

69
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,220
about the attacks that have happened uh

70
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,560
what you have done for this I mean this

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,840
is fundamental that everybody could

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,540
prepare and what we have done in Estonia

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,379
because it's not only the country or or

74
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,080
the state institutions it's actually the

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,540
companies can can be attacked and there

76
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,400
can be damages it's uh it's all parts of

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,920
life really so what we have done in

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,040
Estonia we have started to

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,540
uh you know do this sort of cyber audits

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,519
I might say two you know private

81
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,760
companies as well to to see where the

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,480
weakest link is and and and to to get

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,140
this message through that that actually

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,919
cyber uh is for everybody cyber security

85
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,918
depends on everybody because we all use

86
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
computers we are all connected to each

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,259
other and and that could also have a lot

88
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,699
of damages

89
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,740
thank you very much and you already

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,600
named a lot of keywords we need

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,400
cooperation we need data and information

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,400
sharing and we need to know where the

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,320
weakest link is or where the back door

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,080
is which might not be so protected

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,180
um so from your country's experience

96
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,000
what what can others learn like what can

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,960
we learn

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
um looking also at the last days what

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,280
happened here but also what can can

100
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,560
other countries who are maybe not quite

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,259
as advanced yet learn and I'm thinking

102
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,340
of um you countries which want to want

103
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,040
to join the EU and on the way to

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,639
accession

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,460
um

106
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,560
first I think as politicians it's it's a

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,880
very

108
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,280
hard to explain your people that you

109
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,340
have to invest to cyber

110
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,479
um I mean the foundations of your your

111
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,979
e-governance for example I mean

112
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,840
everybody understands if these things

113
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,020
don't work but but so that they function

114
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,380
you also need to invest because you know

115
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,780
the cyber crime and and attacks they

116
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,220
evolve so so we should too but it's not

117
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,800
like for a politician I mean election

118
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,080
campaign that's why I know this so well

119
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,139
you can't go and cut any ribbons right

120
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,960
now and say that we did this but it's

121
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,020
something that you have to do because if

122
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,440
it doesn't function then you know there

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,620
could be great damages improving media

124
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,400
literacy and also cyber literacy I might

125
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,759
say because as you say it's the weakest

126
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,520
link in the society really I I just can

127
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,160
bring you this example that when we

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,039
first started student and to make our

129
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,699
systems really resilient and of course

130
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,479
it is a question of keywords and and you

131
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,620
know making the computers secure and

132
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,539
then it turned out that you know the

133
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,880
judges they said that you know the

134
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,340
passwords are so complicated to get the

135
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,419
those databases what they did they kept

136
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,780
the passwords on their under their

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,740
keyboard so that's not really uh secure

138
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,340
so how do you really address this

139
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,520
because it is the person between the

140
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,340
chair and the computer that is the is

141
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,400
the risk but but what I really want to

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,759
stress is that

143
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,520
companies that are cyber attacked they

144
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,840
are ashamed that they were and these you

145
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,759
know attacks were successful so they

146
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,680
don't talk about this and they don't

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,139
want to share the information Nation but

148
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,720
it's important to get over this because

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,020
only this way others can learn you know

150
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,599
you have been attacked so that to avoid

151
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,360
the attacks in the future and also to

152
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,539
improve the resilience what we do all

153
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,240
the time because we see now the Russian

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,780
attacks on our actually they are not

155
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,039
attributed officially so so maybe I

156
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,500
can't say this

157
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,099
so openly but the attacks on our system

158
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,280
I would say we see that they are

159
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,800
learning I mean they see so that okay

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,900
these things are not going through so

161
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,780
they are improving and constantly trying

162
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,780
new ways to really undermine our systems

163
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,060
so especially for small and medium-sized

164
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,099
Enterprises it's not so always so easy

165
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,039
right to implement good cyber security

166
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,139
and hygiene but it's also a reputational

167
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,840
risk I guess for them so how did you

168
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,940
help them

169
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,740
we have

170
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,599
um

171
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,819
institution that that works with the

172
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,400
cyber

173
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,780
um cyber base I would say everything

174
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,460
regarding the attacks and it's the state

175
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,399
information agency

176
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,760
so they started to educate companies

177
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,719
just took okay let us in we we look

178
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,140
where are your weakest links and and

179
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,200
doing this and then doing training and

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,700
and and all of it and also putting

181
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,880
sharing information as as a top priority

182
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,880
for the companies as well showing the

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,240
benefit that they get out of this so so

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
they could prepare as well

185
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,459
and well

186
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,300
we have discovered uh you know weak

187
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,720
links and those companies are preparing

188
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,779
those so so I think that the positive

189
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,019
side I hope is that we have managed to

190
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,899
prevent some cyber attacks being

191
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,240
successful

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,220
of course

193
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,200
in in some you can't avoid it all if if

194
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,940
people or companies don't really want it

195
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,519
but I guess at least in Estonia

196
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,279
everybody understands that you know they

197
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,080
are vulnerable in this regard because

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,720
everything is online and in computers

199
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,180
and you can be very severely damaged

200
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,540
so over the last day and also at the

201
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,000
Munich security conference we talk a lot

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,860
about the changing geopolitical

203
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,959
environment and the role of being more

204
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,700
and more divided into two-part

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,860
democracies on one hand side autocracies

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,600
on the other in lots of countries in

207
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,100
between which aren't really quite

208
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,200
decided yet

209
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,540
um and um this I mean it's it's a

210
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
battlefield ideas for values

211
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,019
um so looking at the global South what

212
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,180
is our responsibility when it comes to

213
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,060
cyber security and the global South

214
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,519
uh

215
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,560
we have um issued such

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,800
like such a what is what is the word now

217
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,459
in English well um the the idea is of

218
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,740
trusted connectivity why I talk about

219
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,000
this is that we see that in China and

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,940
other actors are really investing to the

221
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,820
global South and and you can be

222
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,220
vulnerable directly but you can also be

223
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,000
vulnerable via the connections you have

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,399
so so who controls those connections who

225
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,920
makes those Investments and what we can

226
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,220
do I think is to concentrate on those

227
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Investments that they are not made by by

228
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,560
somebody else I think uh in terms of of

229
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,180
raising your

230
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,920
um

231
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,680
power in the world there can be many

232
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,079
tools and some are very direct

233
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,180
aggression and some are more indirect so

234
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,779
um

235
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,200
to bring the global South you know those

236
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,440
who share the same values I always like

237
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
the idea that every connection you have

238
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,279
um make sure that you are connected to

239
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,260
friends because the other side of the

240
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,380
connection might also hurt you

241
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,700
because we are interdependent and and

242
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,220
investing in the global South the

243
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,399
infrastructure and I'm not only talking

244
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,279
about the

245
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,820
infrastructure as we know it but also

246
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,459
the parts technology everything that can

247
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,600
be the tools for for getting the power

248
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,140
over uh over those countries and of

249
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,779
course the media literacy and and

250
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,180
information Warfare that is going on

251
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,360
regarding the narratives really this is

252
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,480
maybe another topic not directly cyber

253
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,839
but it's very very closely connected

254
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,300
no absolutely and I agree

255
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,000
um another topic we talked a lot about

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,899
is how to attract young people to the

257
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,959
field of cyber security

258
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,959
and that's why I um decided that we

259
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,120
should bring in somebody young here into

260
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,459
the discussion and I would love to open

261
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,639
it up for one question or two preferably

262
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,260
of two young people who

263
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,660
one question one question very brief

264
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,540
question okay so a brave A Brave Young

265
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,240
person come on up and ask a question

266
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,910
anything younger than us

267
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,920
[Laughter]

268
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,060
feeling young also also feeling Young

269
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,360
so so far so far in my family at least

270
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,440
uh the the line for youth Grows Where My

271
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,200
parents currently are so they are at 74

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,920
so everybody under 74 are young

273
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,839
so please

274
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,160
okay yes please

275
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,320
so much uh Alexander Martin here from

276
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,279
the records uh do you think that cyber

277
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,620
attacks will lessen going forward with

278
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,779
with increased resilience through Europe

279
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,720
or does a different attack other than

280
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,100
resilience need to be taken

281
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
um we haven't seen that they will lessen

282
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,019
and I don't think they will I mean they

283
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,420
have been increasing because this is the

284
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,019
way you can also uh where you can hurt

285
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,620
uh the society really so I think they

286
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,200
change we see uh the change like every

287
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,440
week I don't get the reports every week

288
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,720
but when I go to the state information

289
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,320
agency they show how you know okay you

290
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,079
you said something here attacks went up

291
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,100
again and and this is uh here they

292
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,800
change tactics so

293
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,519
um so I I think as I say you know the

294
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,620
bad guys share information and and

295
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,920
develop their attacks so I don't see

296
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,860
anywhere soon that they will lessen vice

297
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,019
versa I actually think that if the

298
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,959
conventional war will stop

299
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,240
these attacks will continue and and in a

300
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,180
broader broader scale as well regarding

301
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,120
the youth actually it just

302
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,740
um it is a question for them

303
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,320
um I read I read

304
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,500
an article where uh privacy was said to

305
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,959
be

306
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,180
a generational issue that for young

307
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,880
people privacy is not an issue at all

308
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,339
they don't feel that you know I put it

309
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,720
all out there and and you know I put it

310
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,519
voluntarily so that's not an issue for

311
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,060
me and I see this as a great worry that

312
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,720
they don't feel the threat that this can

313
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,000
be used although they are literally

314
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,660
living their lives online that you you

315
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,079
can also be attacked online so raising

316
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,920
the awareness is is definitely

317
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,260
very important but I don't know if if

318
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,760
you know the fight that privacy versus

319
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,380
non-privacy

320
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,100
maybe that is a fight we have lost or

321
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,019
actually the young people don't really

322
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:01,980
care

323
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,399
until they are hurt of course absolutely

324
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,500
and so I would say there's lots more to

325
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,339
do

326
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,579
um but I'm getting the eye

327
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,620
this already concludes our very brief

328
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,019
fireside chat as I said you are a role

329
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,180
model to to all of us um and you

330
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,160
fulfilled all our expectations

331
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
um uh today in this talk by giving us a

332
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,139
really wonderful overview thank you so

333
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,060
very much and now you have to keep on

334
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,420
dancing and next to to the next party

335
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,019
thank you so much
