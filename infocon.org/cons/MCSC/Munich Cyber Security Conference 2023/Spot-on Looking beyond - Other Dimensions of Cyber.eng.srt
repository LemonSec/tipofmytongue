[Music]

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,720
panel over the years on a wide range of

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,460
topics but one feature has remained the

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,859
same and that has a panel in common with

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,619
some cyberspace that there are no limits

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,019
and No Boundaries so we talk about a

8
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,719
wide range of topics

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,980
and we tend to be on the gloomy side

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,480
normally we are largely focused on

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,640
threats and threats of Assessments but I

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,140
noticed that this year it's a little

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,480
more upbeat but we're also talking about

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,700
the next big thing in artificial

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,879
intelligence in other areas of cyber and

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,100
we would like to focus on that today and

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm happy to announce a stellar cast

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,199
again of people with Sabine if you want

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,920
to might come up first hello nearby from

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,239
rhb Hello the first public illicit

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,420
company in Germany on space and Aviation

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,939
joined by Phil who is

23
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,400
I think uh it was coming that's good to

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
know hi Phil

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,060
um who is obviously with Google Cloud

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,119
but uh previously he was also uh working

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,040
for Goldman Sachs and basically

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
protecting our financial system hence

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,180
our money so that's good to know and

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,520
Christopher of course uh from recorded

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,100
future hello in Washington

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,939
um

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,159
which is uh simply is the largest

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,080
intelligence company which is pretty

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,140
cool to say actually yeah so even if you

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,840
are not focused only on threats but

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
let's start with you and I'm sure you

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,320
have discussed that incident today

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,540
multiple times but yeah yesterday there

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,280
was this Digger operator here in Germany

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,100
who

42
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,420
damaged a few cables and basically shut

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,360
down the entire airport for the entire

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,119
day so is that something you should

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,740
laugh about or is that something you

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,360
should be deeply concerned about because

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,060
it shows that there is still a lack of

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,100
understanding how vulnerable this

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,020
critical infrastructure is no but it's a

50
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,199
good

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,319
this works good so you know when we see

52
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,879
those sort of things we obviously always

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,099
go Cyber attack and in fact one of my

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,200
colleagues in the room uh I made that

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
point to oh Cyber attack and this person

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,700
said whenever it's this sort of stuff it

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
always turns out to be a cable and he

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,379
was very right so so um the and I think

59
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,420
also the so number one and then Sir Alex

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,640
made the point earlier about cables and

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
you know we talked about Russia a lot

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
here and googie and what is it 75 uh I'm

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,819
not gonna remember their unit number now

64
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,599
I should but um the the main director

65
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,180
for undersea research in Russia who

66
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,040
knows everything about how to cut cables

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
and so cables are important I guess

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,200
that's uh cables are important but isn't

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,640
it a little worrying that there wasn't a

70
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,560
backup system in place

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,780
um I think you know as we see our world

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,599
become more and more interconnected I

73
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,220
like to say that we're sort of at a one

74
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,620
percent of where it's going to get you

75
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,239
know many ways we may think that the

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,459
internet is sort of done no we're at one

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,620
percent we're at 1.1 percent of where

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,500
it's going to get and the sort of

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,360
criticality of

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
or lack of of dual infrastructure you

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
know the the single point of failure is

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,459
maybe it's the right word is is I don't

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,959
think we have any clue about how that

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,239
how bad that is Phil if we are

85
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,159
determined to look at the bright side it

86
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,260
was mentioned in the panel before that

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,000
the attacks from Russia that we're

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,420
forecasting our uh during the past year

89
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,400
of the or the year since the invasion

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
happened

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
um we're not as bad as as many people

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
predicted was that primarily because the

93
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,799
Russian attacks and Russian attackers

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,900
are not as good as we thought or is your

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,000
defense system just so good

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,860
well so I think you know we we

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,299
interestingly some of you may have seen

98
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,400
we've put out a report today between our

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,379
Google threat team and our colleagues at

100
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,760
mandian threat intelligence called the

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,280
fog of War which analyzes that situation

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
in fact you know the the the Russian

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,000
attacks did increase

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,799
um you know clearly against Ukraine and

105
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,420
against NATO

106
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,340
um I think also we've seen some

107
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,200
fragmentation of

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,780
um russian-aligned criminal groups that

109
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,620
are

110
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,060
um you know if one of a better phrase

111
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,060
breaking apart their allegiances because

112
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,860
um as we all remember attackers have

113
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,020
bosses and budgets as well

114
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,460
um and so there's only a finance of

115
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,320
resources to go around in terms of doing

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,820
attacks and actually achieving their

117
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,040
criminal goals and if the uh if they're

118
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,139
aligned Masters and not supporting their

119
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,639
profit-making objectives there's going

120
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,500
to be fractures in that and I think we

121
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
certainly see that but just on the more

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,560
positive note

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
um well I often describe myself as

124
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,220
short-term pessimistic long-term

125
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,680
optimistic short-term pessimist because

126
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,479
there's still a lot of bad things going

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,280
on in the world and there's going to be

128
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,440
a lot more attack and more and more

129
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,500
organizations need to definitely upgrade

130
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,180
their defenses

131
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,800
um one of the things we see a lot in

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,320
Cloud infrastructure is companies moving

133
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,479
to the cloud to tap into that higher

134
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,400
level of defense and resilience and

135
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,220
that's the reason I'm more long-term

136
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,840
optimistic is because we have a path

137
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,600
forward to raise the Baseline level of

138
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,960
defenses that adjusts the economic cycle

139
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,900
of attackers imposes cost on them which

140
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,060
starts to tilt the dynamic in in our

141
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,280
favor but interestingly just going to

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
the point you just made about resilience

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,300
is fascinating one of the things that I

144
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,100
I too was impacted by the flights

145
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,080
yesterday and it must be my luck I've

146
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,440
had a few similar situations yeah well

147
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,180
we have a few simple situations with

148
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,940
some of our nice friendly us-based

149
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,860
Airlines and the interesting thing is

150
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,720
it's one of the things that we've got to

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,979
think about is it's not just a question

152
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,919
of are those systems resilient enough

153
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,740
and are they capable of recovery but are

154
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,600
they also capable of operating in in

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,979
degraded States the thing that

156
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,320
fascinates me is you have a system

157
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,900
outage and it takes everything out and

158
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,460
why does it have to take everything out

159
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,620
you look at some of the some of the

160
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,300
ransomware events that have affected

161
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,940
energy companies they want ransomware

162
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,680
events in their operational technologies

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,479
that controlled refineries and pipelines

164
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,919
there were attacks that affected their

165
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,780
office systems so why did the office

166
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,400
systems have an impact on that

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,139
environment why why don't we have more

168
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,600
isolation and certainly something in you

169
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,740
know particularly hyperscale

170
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,419
infrastructure we're very very focused

171
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,240
on is how do we assign boundaries and

172
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,060
failure zones and security zones to

173
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,699
reduce the effect or the blast radius of

174
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,860
individual failures and as we improve

175
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,419
security we've also got to think about

176
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,100
how do we improve our ability to be

177
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,380
resilient in the face of attacks not

178
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,880
just how to deal with the attacks

179
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,100
themselves to be able to bring you in it

180
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,900
can be really annoying now to be stuck

181
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,280
at an airport and to wait for a plane

182
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,800
but if something happens in space it can

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,280
be really crucial and in the in the

184
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,900
run-up to the innovation rightly

185
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,259
afterwards there are many reports on

186
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,880
incidents in space and satellites that

187
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,199
were being attacked How concerned were

188
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,240
you and your company initially and how

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,460
concerned are you now

190
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,979
so luckily we haven't been really

191
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,580
concerned directly

192
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,759
but since we we have infrastructure or

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,940
we have our build Satellites by our own

194
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,660
by by our company and for our Engineers

195
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,160
it's a every satellite that we build is

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,139
a new kid of the family and we have to

197
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,940
take care of it until it leaves us

198
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,400
forever and forever is not going into

199
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,680
space it's uh it's more the time when

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,139
it's going back from space to if it's in

201
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,080
the Leo to Earth so becoming becoming

202
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,720
Starlight or if it's a Geo to go

203
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,919
somewhere else but it really showed the

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,319
the attacks on The Wire rights uh

205
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,979
satellite network but also on on on the

206
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,199
bright side if you can say it in in in

207
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,240
times of War

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,860
um

209
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,039
the uh the use of of styling it really

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
showed that um space-based

211
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,319
infrastructure is in not only talking

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
about resilience but really on talking

213
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,660
about the ability to communicate and we

214
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,199
cannot still we we are at a global

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,539
digitalized society and we rely on

216
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,419
cables and we have learned that this is

217
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,099
not a good idea

218
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,620
um we have also yes we have also seen

219
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,979
and learned that um being

220
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,259
uh all that uh

221
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,199
that the gentleman's agreements that we

222
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,080
all thought that everyone is relying on

223
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,899
like um we are not invading we are not

224
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,159
we are not having an Envision into

225
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,679
Ukraine it's not really something that

226
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,140
um is still a fact and therefore it's

227
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,839
also uh the outer space treaty saying

228
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,660
there's no militarization of space

229
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,440
um

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
I think that um I don't want to say that

231
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,300
we have to really overthink this but we

232
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,160
have to be

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,399
we have to stop being naive about it and

234
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,500
therefore we do not only have to think

235
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,019
about how to protect our Assets in space

236
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,019
we have to think about about also more

237
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,940
resilience in space and we have to think

238
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,440
about

239
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
um how to save the infrastructure that

240
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,820
is needed on the ground because uh if

241
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,260
you don't have access to space if you

242
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,000
don't have no interest to bring

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,300
satellites into space

244
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,940
there's very much emptiness in space but

245
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,560
also you cannot operate satellites if

246
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,700
you don't have a ground infrastructure

247
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,040
if Phil I was glad to hear that you're a

248
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,080
long-term Optimist is that partly

249
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,720
because after the violation of that

250
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,180
gentleman's agreement a year ago did we

251
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,360
see a new push for more uh cooperation

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,580
between private actors and and

253
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,760
government agencies to really invest in

254
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
cyber security

255
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,860
um so I think that there's been a a

256
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,320
long-term strong relationship in many

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,540
geographers between the the public and

258
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,700
the private sector to share information

259
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,160
about threats and vulnerabilities again

260
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,100
to work as fast as we can to resolve

261
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,839
these things based on observed

262
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
intelligence one of the things I think

263
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
that while we often talk about the

264
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,140
importance of the public-private

265
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,700
partnership between governments and

266
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,740
private sector I think we also need to

267
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,500
remember that most of the work that

268
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,380
happens every single day is private to

269
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,540
private relationships through constructs

270
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,580
like information sharing and Analysis

271
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,339
centers through various other things

272
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,959
that happened in and out of various

273
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,839
National and sector-specific certs and

274
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,220
the most important thing and I think

275
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,800
this is something that is is has been

276
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,779
transformed and continues to be

277
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,019
transformational is industrializing

278
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,120
information sharing there's a history of

279
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,500
where information sharing between

280
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,480
organizations and between public and

281
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,060
private sector was bit artisanal it was

282
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,820
kind of you know craftsmanship based and

283
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,860
individuals sharing information with

284
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,720
each other what we're driving towards

285
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
now is the industrialization of this

286
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,040
process so that we can make sharing and

287
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,420
the response to the sharing of those

288
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,820
threats more real time I kind of like to

289
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,019
think about what we're doing as well

290
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,500
wiring up the planet as a digital immune

291
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,540
system so we can detect one attack in

292
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,240
one place and quickly upgrade or respond

293
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
to that in all places again imposing

294
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,000
costs yeah no I would I would agree and

295
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
I would say you came from the financial

296
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,959
markets you know think about the way we

297
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,279
talk about public private information

298
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,500
sharing to be honest it's ridiculous the

299
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,240
way it works so it's it's I will say

300
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
that imagine if you're going on the

301
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,260
stock market and said I want to buy long

302
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,079
Google short Goldman and the way that I

303
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,519
would get the information that's exactly

304
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,140
what I did no so I would use price

305
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,600
inevitable or long long Goldman short

306
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,640
Google and I would want to get price

307
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,140
Discovery for that I want to get the

308
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,300
stock price and now I'm going to go out

309
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,880
and do some public private information

310
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,160
sharing to get the price do you imagine

311
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,740
how this sounds ridiculous and nobody

312
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,200
would be able to you know to trade on

313
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,019
that and number two it would be

314
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,300
incredibly dangerous from dangerous

315
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
actors taking advantage of this stuff

316
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,399
every single second and that's you know

317
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,899
what politicians have been talking about

318
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,180
for 30 years public private information

319
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,820
sharing boom no so you need principal

320
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,279
actors who take ownership of the problem

321
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,079
so in financial markets Bloomberg does

322
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,779
that then we model our company to be the

323
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,880
Bloomberg of cyber security so you know

324
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
and then now you could also Imagine you

325
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
had other sort of constructs it could

326
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,459
you know but but Bloomberg is a great

327
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,019
example of doing this in the financial

328
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,540
markets and they're similar examples in

329
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,220
Pharmaceuticals and how can that really

330
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,440
be because I mean largely uh Bloomberg

331
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,180
and even your company is still a profit

332
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,620
driven Enterprise I mean you're not

333
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,959
doing it pro bono right no but I think

334
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,139
it's a tough problem and so you know you

335
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,700
could imagine having governments doing

336
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,740
it so for example in so in

337
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,620
pharmaceutical Adverse Events to drugs

338
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,720
very important if you guys take a drug

339
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,940
and there's a problem that gets reported

340
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,700
the U.S government has take on itself to

341
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,100
develop this air system adverse event

342
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,920
reporting system and they will from even

343
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,959
if it happens in the deepest parts of

344
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,839
China they'll take that data aggregate

345
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,240
it and turn into a great data set that

346
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,700
any one of you can download and analyze

347
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,440
and so it doesn't have to be Bloomberg

348
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,700
it could be a government sort of thing

349
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,339
but the one thing it cannot be is public

350
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,260
private information sure is this stupid

351
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,240
so that is stupid but it's

352
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,920
public-private partnership particularly

353
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,779
and to be controversial no that's fine

354
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,820
in space security I mean is that

355
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,920
something that

356
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,600
um you have experienced over the past

357
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,839
years evolving or not yes yes it is

358
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,820
evolving um I

359
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,980
so from my perspective public private

360
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,139
partnership especially if uh if it's

361
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,360
taking place in Germany it's

362
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,100
um

363
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,959
if you have a little bit complicated but

364
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,139
um to be optimistic as well on short

365
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,180
term as on a long-term basis

366
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,100
um I think there's always room for

367
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,779
improvement so

368
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:55,500
um

369
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,980
especially in space I think that public

370
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,560
private partnership has more

371
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,600
opportunities because everything you do

372
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,540
in spaces do will use and therefore

373
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,480
um there are no borders and therefore

374
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,100
you can also share more information

375
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,720
because if you collect information

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,060
especially for example your Opera you're

377
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,800
a private operator of your own Earth

378
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,839
observation constellation like I don't

379
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,700
know we know all from from the news

380
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,519
especially since uh the Ukrainian the

381
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,200
invasion in the Ukraine

382
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,260
um from Maxa or from I don't know

383
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,399
other private companies and um

384
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,380
there the the public-private partnership

385
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,139
can also be that uh the the the private

386
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,180
company sells the information the

387
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,120
picture or the service to the government

388
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,519
and um

389
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,279
from my perspective this is uh this is a

390
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,800
good example of Public Partnerships

391
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,959
if you have uh

392
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,240
pop the private Partnerships already in

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,779
in building the hardware or then it

394
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,339
could be a little bit more complicated

395
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,920
because then you have always a

396
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,480
government or an Institutional customer

397
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,380
who is

398
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,079
is particularly touchy often in Germany

399
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,940
and that the partnership is more of

400
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,320
building this partnership is more

401
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,820
complicated than other countries have

402
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,639
you seen the uh often quoted Titan

403
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,980
vendor the the turning point in that

404
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,160
area as well now over the past year

405
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,260
um so what the the Titan vendor has

406
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,519
brought us

407
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,660
um is the Titan vendor and and the war

408
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,180
um uh that we are talking much more

409
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,459
about space as an infrastructure as a

410
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,199
critical infrastructure we are talking

411
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,800
much more as well in Germany as in all

412
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,519
other European countries and in

413
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,220
especially in the European Union about

414
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,920
um how do we have to build up our

415
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
military infrastructure in space

416
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,040
um we have more information and we we

417
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,180
see more upcoming business or needs in

418
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,100
terms of Safety and Security in space

419
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,380
and from space which is not only the

420
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,839
military use but also

421
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,660
um how to deal with space debris how how

422
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,820
can we how can we protect our

423
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,500
infrastructure and space and how can we

424
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,560
protect our planet Earth from from the

425
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,579
from from space as it's it's not so you

426
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,279
have asteroids you have uh not man-made

427
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,320
space debris

428
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,639
but

429
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,240
um

430
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,360
if you really want to break it down on

431
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
on what is written on paper about uh

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,399
about how to spend the budget that is

433
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,259
coming from the Titan land there it's

434
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,880
much more saved for other dimensions not

435
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,079
really space now we looked to the

436
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,519
challenges from the past but let's let's

437
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,199
look forward

438
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,060
um many people were in awe of what

439
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,740
happened recently on artificial

440
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,959
intelligence and it has really changed

441
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,240
the equation for many again when you

442
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,800
look at it Phil from your professional

443
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,320
perspective do you see the rice or the

444
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,839
the constant Improvement of artificial

445
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,839
intelligence as a threat overall or as a

446
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,380
real opportunity to improve things no so

447
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,260
so the the I mean we've been investing

448
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,839
massively in artificial intelligence for

449
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,900
the longest time and it's embedded in

450
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,660
many of our products and it achieves

451
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,359
great cyber security effect every single

452
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,760
day so for the uh for the nearly 2

453
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,980
billion people that use Gmail every day

454
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,200
artificial intelligence is protecting

455
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,039
you against malware fishing all sorts of

456
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,840
spam various different links that may

457
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,440
take you to to unwelcome websites you

458
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,480
know that's you know AI has been the uh

459
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,520
the engine behind that cyber security

460
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,160
effect for many years and I could talk

461
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,720
for five hours about all the places

462
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,660
we've applied and embedded AI

463
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,460
um I think you know over the past couple

464
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,640
of years with the research into

465
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,380
Transformer models that was created at

466
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,660
Google that led to the creation of these

467
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,000
large language models I think we're also

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
seeing the classic dual use issue where

469
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,900
these things are going to be immensely

470
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,880
useful for defensive purposes but

471
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,380
they're also going to lead to many other

472
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,480
consequences we have to deal with you

473
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,679
know one of the things we've been very

474
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,620
very focused on the responsible safe and

475
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,440
ethical use of AI and making sure that

476
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,480
we think about the consequences of using

477
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,400
this technology and introducing and

478
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,640
managing it in in appropriate ways but

479
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,100
we're very very aggressively look always

480
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,200
looking at the opportunities for AI to

481
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,480
act on the difference and it's just

482
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,760
proven highly advantageous on the

483
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,620
defensive front for the past many years

484
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,940
and it's going to continue to do that

485
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,559
but earned you a little concern that

486
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,059
artificial intelligence is going to help

487
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,940
a competitor to basically uh

488
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,760
compete with you in a much more

489
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
challenging way now we're always

490
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,419
observing competitors all the time and

491
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,000
everything so uh um I don't particularly

492
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,380
worry about kind of things that

493
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,539
hallucinate regularly so I mean I think

494
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,640
we have to think about how do we

495
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,220
continue to provide capabilities to

496
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,900
people that's the most useful for their

497
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,360
job at hand and delivering accurate

498
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,640
results that that they can rely on is

499
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,980
very important and similarly on a cyber

500
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,080
security front applying artificial

501
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,140
intelligence for a defensive mission to

502
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,179
keep giving us defensive advantage over

503
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,700
attackers and driving the accost costs

504
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,440
up for attackers is just part of the

505
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,820
equation we've been dealing with for the

506
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,320
longest time should Google be more

507
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,480
concerned because artificial

508
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,400
intelligence is going to change the

509
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,260
equation no you know look Google is

510
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,059
incredible at artificial intelligence

511
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,039
we've had a lot of fun with this so we

512
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,960
for example in Ukraine

513
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,960
were deployed in 12 or 13 agencies over

514
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,059
there and I think we get in like

515
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,980
hundreds of thousands of images every

516
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,620
day now sort of from and and not sort of

517
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,120
in the Cyber domain but more in the

518
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,860
physical domain and and so now you get

519
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,260
very interested can I beat a human at

520
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,720
detecting Shaheed 136 drones versus

521
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,660
Shaheed 131 drones versus these sort of

522
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,820
things and so we've been we've announced

523
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,320
a big collaboration with the Ukrainian

524
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,240
government on building uh called an

525
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,039
intelligence Dome around critical

526
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
infrastructure that has a cyber element

527
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,660
to it but also a physical element to it

528
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,640
and and you can imagine use these sort

529
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,919
of techniques there in in ways that

530
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,660
you're not going to have a human be able

531
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,760
to do it because of just sheer volume

532
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,580
and so you know and and then we should

533
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,380
be careful about you know dual use

534
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,000
absolutely but no there are some pretty

535
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
incredible stuff that you can do at the

536
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,520
same time

537
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,340
and it's exciting you know I'm a nerd if

538
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,380
that doesn't come true I'm a nerd and so

539
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,820
you get very excited about stuff you can

540
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,520
do at the same time you know it's still

541
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
data analysis I started doing data

542
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,380
analysis in 1991 and if you don't know

543
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,820
the problem you're going to solve it

544
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,620
doesn't matter which sort of technique

545
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,419
you pull out of there there's still no

546
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,460
magic you've got to know the problem

547
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,020
you're going to solve and all those sort

548
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,700
of things so it's been it's been

549
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,720
interesting as well I mean I think

550
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,760
people forget

551
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,100
um with the latest focused on these

552
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,220
particular generative AI models the AI

553
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,820
is just embedded already in every part

554
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,539
of every sector around the world we work

555
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,280
for example with a number of large

556
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,500
financial institutions where I was

557
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
successfully using AI

558
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,200
to apply for anti-money laundering to

559
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,660
mitigate terrorist financing to mitigate

560
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,700
many other things and it's enabling them

561
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,760
to have massive increases in accuracy

562
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,460
lower false positives and false negative

563
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,740
lives it increases the productivity of

564
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,240
their workflow that's just one we do

565
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,440
other things with pharmaceutical

566
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,720
companies on drug analysis we do things

567
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,960
with every research that's AI today is a

568
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,020
big part of the Machinery of every part

569
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,299
of society and the great thing about it

570
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,940
is that introduction of that has been

571
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,480
done in safe and responsible ways where

572
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,659
we're able to validate models explain in

573
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,340
many cases the results of what's

574
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,679
happening and be able to put them in the

575
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,020
constraints of the appropriate risk

576
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,179
managed structure of those businesses

577
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,159
and doing that going forward to get the

578
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,860
best out of AI in a responsible and safe

579
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,380
way is is the most important thing is

580
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,360
that to Rosie a picture of AI in your

581
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,840
point of view

582
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,880
to be honest it's not really my specific

583
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,900
field

584
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,500
um and uh of course we are

585
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,900
um we are also working with that and of

586
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,840
course AI is uh important for for space

587
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,900
companies but honestly I don't think um

588
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,880
that we are already on that level that

589
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,799
is discussed right here because I'm

590
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,700
really

591
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,799
exciting on what you are talking and

592
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,140
yeah it sounds pretty cool and it's very

593
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,440
much information on very short time

594
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,260
well we have time for a few questions so

595
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,299
who would like to to be first maybe you

596
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,220
can introduce yourself briefly and and

597
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,900
your question was a question mark

598
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,380
ideally

599
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,179
hi my name is Lucha I worked for the

600
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,820
United Nations for several years also in

601
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,679
cyber security so the question is why

602
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,020
was Starling so successful

603
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,620
in Ukraine and was it because it came

604
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,620
from a private partner because official

605
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,299
other methods of communications could

606
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,419
not be deployed and do you think musks

607
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,580
should continue providing it I think

608
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,620
Federal of the minister who bought it

609
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,640
was just all in he's great he's 31 years

610
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,820
old and just very like with him

611
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,620
procurement is fairly easy it's fast

612
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,860
it's like things walk and he just goes

613
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,559
and that sort of mindset to things plus

614
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,200
technology that is obviously good you

615
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,760
know you can imagine in pretty much the

616
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,179
other 199 countries on the planet that

617
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,860
would have taken about five years before

618
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,440
that got deployed so I will give a lot

619
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
of credit to the good Federal of vice

620
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,700
prime minister of Ukraine incredible guy

621
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,100
who we're about to respond to yes I

622
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,400
think that um one of the the key factors

623
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,000
were or was that um

624
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,260
it was there

625
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,780
and it was available

626
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,740
um none of the other telecommunication

627
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,500
constellations are um on that level of

628
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,659
of ambition right now

629
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,659
I also think that Elon Musk did a very

630
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,120
good it might be very good marketing but

631
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,679
he he was uh he has sent the terminals

632
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
very

633
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,820
uh very fast and very cheap to to the

634
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,120
Ukrainian user and it showed that um at

635
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,880
least it we have to have a resilient way

636
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,919
of communication and

637
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,679
although we have uh the opportunity to

638
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,400
have

639
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,539
um the classical satellite

640
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,700
Communications as we we know it from

641
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,800
military use

642
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,260
[Music]

643
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,220
um

644
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,220
the Starling idea or the idea of having

645
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,039
communication constellations in in the

646
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,520
Leo orbit that also provides broadband

647
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,100
and this is I think also one of the keys

648
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,240
it's no longer only or it's no longer

649
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,780
between Broadband for for broadcast or

650
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,539
do we communicate but it's it's only the

651
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,000
internet and therefore that's I think

652
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,700
also very important why styling uh has

653
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,419
has been such a key factor for how how

654
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,539
the Ukrainian were able to communicate

655
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,480
I don't I'm I don't think that it's it's

656
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,260
me to to say if uh Elon Musk should

657
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,779
um or what or if styling should be

658
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,880
provided to the Ukraine any longer or

659
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,279
not um but I think that um what what

660
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,620
really happened it it showed that

661
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,600
especially Europe has no no own

662
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,520
competence in that and this is why Iris

663
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,820
Square which is now um officially uh

664
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,020
also

665
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,000
um debate has been decided by the

666
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,400
European Parliament so this will be the

667
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,500
European telecommunication constellation

668
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,440
so from the institution and this should

669
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,020
bring the the service that styling now

670
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,000
provides to to Europe and to the world

671
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
since it's yeah it's a worldwide

672
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,260
consolation but it's uh it's yeah the

673
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,779
the customer or the service is provided

674
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,299
by the European commissioner and I'll

675
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,860
really emphasize I think it's great you

676
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,480
bring up the musk point to being sort of

677
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,520
the his he's a doer and then you're

678
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,779
Federal on the other end when you sit

679
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,279
down with him and he pulls up his phone

680
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,200
and says do you want to create a company

681
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,059
yeah I'd like to create a company this

682
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,980
is exciting and it hits his phone and

683
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,360
and boom you have a Ukrainian company

684
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,860
you create a Ukrainian company and

685
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,740
bypass you know lawyers and by the way

686
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,900
when we do this we actually remove a lot

687
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,240
of ability to for corruption blah blah

688
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,559
blah so it's like you know and you put

689
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,360
that obviously in the context of War now

690
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,520
they can move fast and and I think

691
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,320
probably for a lot of us in this room

692
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,140
this is a good good lesson

693
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,760
so I want to start a company or crane do

694
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,960
it now

695
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,940
um you're next

696
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,100
the microphone is coming that's maybe

697
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,399
easy

698
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
you you've been talking about

699
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,380
communication satellite Elon Musk when

700
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,179
it comes to protecting the communication

701
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,400
on those lines actually uh could you

702
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,620
give me your take on what the quantum

703
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,220
computer challenge or threat would be

704
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,159
and one little bit more specific on that

705
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,860
I would like to understand uh of course

706
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,340
also the U.S take when it comes to

707
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,380
Quantum key distribution against uh post

708
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,080
Quantum encryption if you could be more

709
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,880
specific yeah so just kind of a bit

710
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,279
background the question so you know

711
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,960
clearly you know everybody's watching

712
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,419
the development of of quantum computers

713
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,279
and the uh the real threat on the

714
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,740
horizon is the availability of what we

715
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,240
would describe as a cryptographically

716
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,100
relevant quantum computer that's of

717
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,320
sufficient scale to be able to break

718
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,600
much of the public key cryptography

719
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,720
that's vital for many of the the key

720
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,860
exchanges and other secure

721
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,360
Communications

722
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,220
um you know I I've no kind of crystal

723
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,220
ball as to when such a a computer will

724
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,659
come about but the one thing I would say

725
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,880
is it's moved from the domain of physics

726
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,679
to the domain of engineering and if

727
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,120
there's anything taught us over the past

728
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,740
few decades Engineers can always work

729
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,419
quicker than we ever expect them to do

730
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,000
so I think I would range the

731
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
availability of a such a quantum

732
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
computer to be in the in the 2035 range

733
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,260
but you know that could be more it could

734
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,940
be longer there's still some fundamental

735
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,559
challenges on Quantum error correction

736
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
and other things to be able to kind of

737
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
realize the uh such a computer but we

738
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,340
can't wait and so one of the things that

739
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,980
nist particularly in the US have already

740
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,679
announced the uh post post Quantum

741
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,440
cryptographic algorithms uh we're hoping

742
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,940
that the standards of how they'll be

743
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,039
used are released next year and we would

744
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,900
expect that many companies like us are

745
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,000
going to be fast implementers of that to

746
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,520
get ahead of the quantum threat we've

747
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,500
already been trialing quite extensively

748
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,600
these algorithms in our infrastructure I

749
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,120
I don't have I don't have objective data

750
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,380
on this but we think we're one of the

751
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,179
largest implementations if not the

752
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,159
largest of some of the peaky see

753
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,559
algorithms in our infrastructure layered

754
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,360
on top of the existing cryptographic

755
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,700
infrastructure to test performance but

756
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,779
one of the things I would say is we're

757
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,580
encouraging all organizations to start

758
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,320
planning for this transition because

759
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,600
it's going to take a long time and it's

760
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,400
a little bit like a Y2K problem you've

761
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,080
got to go find these things and fix them

762
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,299
and replace them on the quantum key

763
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,159
distribution piece one of the things is

764
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,460
we're not so positive on that I think

765
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,620
the the quantum key distribution itself

766
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,679
is not necessarily a viable replacement

767
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,659
as a tactic for mitigating the risks of

768
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,460
computers just because of deployment

769
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,039
challenges also there's been substantial

770
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,140
security weaknesses in its

771
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,840
implementation so we're all in on post

772
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,179
Quantum cryptography less so on Quantum

773
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,760
key distribution we have exactly one

774
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,559
minute left so one brief question to

775
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,159
each of you uh with the uh

776
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,100
and I'm asking for a brief answer uh

777
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,679
starting with you Phil um what keeps you

778
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,419
up at night now when you think of the

779
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,760
future of cyberspace so so there's

780
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,960
there's one thing and I'm kind of almost

781
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,240
phrasing it as a negative so I I think

782
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,840
the biggest opportunity for us all to

783
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,299
resolve cyber security issues is to

784
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,820
modernize our technology platforms I

785
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,380
think if we can invest as much in

786
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,720
modernizing away from Legacy systems

787
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,360
where the security isn't built in it's

788
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,580
bolted on after the fact if we can get a

789
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,980
modern more defendable architectures

790
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,659
where the security is built in not

791
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,760
bolted on that's our tremendous

792
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
opportunity and anything that gets in

793
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,960
the way of that modernization to get to

794
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
more defendable architectures is is not

795
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,919
a good thing the faster we can get to

796
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,120
that the better

797
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,659
Sabrina even briefer maybe

798
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,840
so for me I think that cyber security is

799
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,659
uh or it's very close to space and

800
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,700
security from space and Security in

801
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,860
space and therefore I agree with Phil

802
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,039
that we have to really look at our

803
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
Technologies we have to develop new

804
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,120
technologies and we have to be brave

805
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,059
enough to LeapFrog wherever it has to be

806
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,720
done and we we have to stop saying it's

807
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,980
all based on our experience

808
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,299
yeah so I made the point that we're sort

809
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,399
of 0.1 percent into connecting the

810
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,679
internet really into our lives and it's

811
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,539
going to get in here another one of your

812
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,580
Elon musk's companies for example is

813
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,380
working on getting a computer into your

814
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,299
brain so I think we have we know a lot

815
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,520
of software vulnerabilities like 300 000

816
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,260
of them let's start enumerating the

817
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,880
human vulnerabilities in the brain and

818
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,440
thinking about what it means to actually

819
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,440
attack those that will be a little bit

820
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
of a different challenge that's probably

821
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,500
the topic for next year thanks so much

822
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,960
to the Fantastic panel and thanks to you

823
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
for listening

824
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,360
foreign
