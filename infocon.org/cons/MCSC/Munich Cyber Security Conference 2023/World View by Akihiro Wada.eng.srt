scheduling it's a complete

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,899
excuse me

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,780
it's a comprehensive economic

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,739
organization in Japan and is listed as

one of institutional partner of MCCSC

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
on behalf on behalf of Caden I would

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,440
like to express my deep gratitude for

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,020
giving me such an opportunity to speak

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,860
in front of expats like you all

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,380
superior to the following panel template

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,560
I would like to share the Japanese

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,260
business communities

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,000
approaches to cyber security for your

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,420
reference

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,500
in nutshell the efforts of the Japanese

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,840
business Community can be summarized

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
into three pillars

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
the first is cross-industry cooperation

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,000
that overlooked the entire supply chain

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,799
second

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
International cooperating

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,659
such as the use of need cyber security

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,619
and framework and third Peter is a

33
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,159
growth public private partnership aimed

34
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,259
as ensuring Economic Security

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,299
in this way we clearly believe that not

36
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,540
only cyber security for all but also

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,180
cyber security bio

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,920
is important in cyber security by all

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,200
every stakeholder proactively work with

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,258
a sense of Crisis to enhance cyber

41
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,339
security as a whole

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,959
I was excited to hear a lively

43
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,180
discussion under the term of who is in

44
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,080
charge

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
against a backdrop we the Japanese

46
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,020
business Community believed that cyber

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,379
security by all is answered to this

48
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,560
question

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,980
bearing this in mind kedanim revised is

50
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,540
a declaration on Cyber Security

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,080
Management in November last year to

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,500
appeal to more than

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,860
1500 member companies and organizations

54
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,340
today I will only limit to the point

55
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,720
foreign

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,260
dating back to the dating back to March

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,099
2018 we we established a declaration of

58
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,920
cadence cyber security management Point

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,580
positioning the time reading up to the

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,640
National event Tokyo Olympics and

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,360
Paralympics as a period of the priority

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,180
efforts

63
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,200
the main purpose is a capitalized on the

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,680
most Advanced Technologies and data to

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
realize Society 5.0 which aimed to solve

66
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,000
social issue and a creative creative

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,400
value to this end

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
from the perspective the boss party

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,519
creation and risk management the entire

70
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,580
business Community should promote cyber

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,400
security measures and contribute to the

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,340
con construction safe and secure

73
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,340
cyberspace

74
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,780
these

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,599
these efforts were successful

76
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,840
we were able to complete the event

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,739
without any serious cyber damage despite

78
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,860
450 million attacks during the Olympic

79
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,640
Games

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,920
which were more than double of round

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,640
Olympic Games

82
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,040
eventually last October we realized we

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,860
revised its cyber security management

84
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,759
declaration for the first time in about

85
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,660
four and a half years to upgrade to

86
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,759
volume 2.0

87
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,919
a digital transformation progressed

88
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,180
rapidly

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,620
new Cyber risk increasing and cyber

90
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,259
attacks by a supply chain of companies

91
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,780
business partners and overseas

92
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,080
subsidiaries are also at the rise

93
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,900
tension spread cyberspace cyber security

94
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,919
has become a brighter area of National

95
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,340
Security

96
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,360
this declaration stressed importance are

97
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,820
enhancing cyber security for the entire

98
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,360
supply chain is terms of industry and

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,180
the importance of public private

100
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,000
partnership in in terms of Economic

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,680
Security

102
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,639
after the announcement of Declaration we

103
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,660
have been exchange view with some key

104
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,440
Partners such as Mr English the White

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
House National cyber security

106
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,620
Ambassador as director and the Miss

107
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,080

UK cyber security ambassador

109
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,680
on how to strength bilateral cyber

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,080
cooperation through public private and

111
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,419
partnership

112
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,720
in this way the Japanese business

113
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,240
Community regards cyber security as a

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,180
top management priority and we are

115
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,600
greatly strengthening in effort for

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
public private partners and

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,880
international collaboration

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,139
to to give a concrete example to

119
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,539
public-private partnership

120
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,479
during the recent Tokyo Olympic and

121
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,479
Paralympics the public and the private

122
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,900
sector work together to conduct six

123
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,860
times security assessment and severe

124
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,919
cyber exercise between 2018 and 2020.

125
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,580
foreign

126
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,940
and also is not yet complete by

127
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,340
reporting Cyber attack damage at the

128
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,759
company to the government

129
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,680
each company

130
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,900
the government to share the anonymized

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,060
information so that each companies can

132
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,520
learn from its part of the practice

133
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,979
furthermore

134
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,240
through the dialogue with like

135
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,100
minded countries such as the UK and the

136
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,580
us we share the common notion that it is

137
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,120
important for the business community

138
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,060
which is a real driver of the economy to

139
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,699
actively act proactively Implement cyber

140
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,280
security measure develop human resource

141
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,799
and students in cyber security

142
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,139
on the other hand I think we also share

143
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,460
the same concerns it is a big issue in

144
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,900
Japan but the importance of part

145
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,300
penetrating cyber security to small and

146
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,599
medium-sized Enterprise that forms

147
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,919
supply chain

148
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,160
as well as to individual in a similar

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,020
concern

150
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,080
against this background I believe it

151
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,840
would be a good idea to draw on a

152
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,720
variety of Japanese initiatives such as

153
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,840
Kaizen a Kaiser means Improvement in

154
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,979
Japanese and discuss what worked

155
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,479
what did not work to enhance our mutual

156
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,160
understanding in Superior cyber security

157
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,280
needless to say

158
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,340
ensuring the safety of cyber species in

159
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,479
essential for business a building the

160
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,299
data-driven society and creating value

161
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,599
we caydenly shall continue to rise

162
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,380
awareness of issue and to work even more

163
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,260
closely with like-minded countries

164
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,700
include the G7

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,580
I would like to conclude my impulse

166
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,040
speech by wishing the panel discussion

167
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,120
that follow will be fruitful

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,960
thank you for your attention

171
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,019
three weeks ago we talked with the group

172
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,540
at Canaan and the National Business

173

that to attend this conference because

175
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,779
in Japan at this time of the year

176
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,240
everyone is busy with concluding the

177
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,800
business here which ends at the end of

178
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,740
March and now when you travel from Japan

179
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,360
I don't know if you're aware to Europe

180
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,019
you go first to Alaska and then over you

181
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,399
know Canada and Greenland and then you

182
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,959
come here so you're sitting 15 or 16

183
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,120
hours in the plane and then they said no

184
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,519
this conference is worth the while and

185
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,019
we will be attending and that's why

186
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,000
thank you so much for doing this

187
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,800
because this is this conference is

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,839
motivated and it's only made possible

189
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,600
because of the Goodwill of our allies

190
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,940
and the transatlantic character of this

191
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,920
conference I think is obvious but

192
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,680
naturally we have the world the economy

193
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,860
number three as a very main Ally which

194
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,899
is Japan thank you very much I wanted to

195
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,430
just give that context

196
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,790
