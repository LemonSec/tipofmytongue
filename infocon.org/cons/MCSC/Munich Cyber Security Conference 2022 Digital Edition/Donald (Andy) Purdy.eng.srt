1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,199
i'm chief security officer for huawei in

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,720
the united states i've been in this role

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,680
for

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,559
10 years this summer

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,719
so i've had quite an interesting uh

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
perspective over over these years

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,000
i think the emerging challenges that

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
we're seeing in cyber security

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,560
uh are really going along with the

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,519
evolution of technology uh as we move

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,920
into an intelligent digital world uh

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
we've recently in the last year or so

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
we've seen some cyber attacks where

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,558
so-called trusted vendors

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,040
were violated

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
we need as a global community not just

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
governments but as a global community we

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,320
need to collaborate to help bring the

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,760
technologies

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,440
to the people and the organizations of

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,559
the world

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,160
but we also need to collaborate in terms

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,719
of figuring out how do we assess

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,520
uh and manage the risk in the world to

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
cyber security and privacy

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,480
and so i don't see it as you know one

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,320
country blocking another country the

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
fact is it's really best if there are

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
global standards

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,640
of certification programs for critical

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,720
equipment there should be independent

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,760
testing

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
of of of key components uh because

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
fundamentally uh as we move into the

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
fourth industrial revolution we are

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,439
getting into technologies where you have

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
sensors to sensory sensor to machine

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
machine to machine communications

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
automation auto automatic responses that

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
will be increasingly be affected by big

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,439
data analytics by artificial

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,159
intelligence um and so

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,600
we as a global community are really

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
going to become much more dependent on

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,079
these technologies information

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
communication technologies these 5g

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,720
enabled technologies for our individual

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
health and safety for organizational

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,360
safe safety and wellness government

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,320
services for clean energy

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
for smart farming intelligent

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
manufacturing all those things so we

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
have to collaborate to make sure that

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,479
we as a global community have an

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
objective and transparent basis for

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
knowing that the products and services

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
that we are using are going to consider

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,520
using

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
are worthy of trust and they're going to

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
be resilient that they're going to be

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
there when we need them to be there and

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
if you could have global standards in

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
global conformance programs it helps

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
promote the ability to generate

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,720
competition because competition can

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
can encourage and create greater

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,599
innovation

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
it can reduce costs and it can promote

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,280
greater security so if we can work

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
together in that sense

71
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,800
then we can move forward uh for the

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
benefit of all

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
i think

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
i think there's an awful lot happening

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
around the world but we have to

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,519
recognize that

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
the major bad guys in the world

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
major nation states they have the

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
ability to hack into everybody so we

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
have to have this as i said an objective

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
and transparent basis for knowing that

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
the products and services are worthy of

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,480
trust and they're going to be there when

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,319
we need them that we can in fact depend

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
on them

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
and uh what keeps you up at night for

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,599
the year 2022 in terms of cyber security

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,640
well i'm not sure that anything

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
particularly keeps me up at night

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
fortunately but uh to the point that

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
that you're raising um

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,640
we have to recognize it's not just that

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
there are all kinds of cyber attacks and

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
and the bad guys are getting more

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
sophisticated

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,959
which they are

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,760
um

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,319
it's that as the technology evolves as

99
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,760
we move toward the full standalone 5g

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
where it goes beyond simply speed and

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
goes to the

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,599
number of connections

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,040
the lag time

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,200
the ability to bring computing power to

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,840
the edge that we are talking about

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
transformation of our way of lives for

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
the good but we have to make sure we

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
work together to address the risk at the

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
same time because we really are going to

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
depend on this stuff a lot more so

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
that's the downside of the great things

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
that this technology promises to bring

113
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,959
to the world and hopefully to

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
reduce poverty in the world but if we

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
don't work together to address the risk

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,239
we may be worse off but i see an awful

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,680
lot of commitment by a lot of people

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
around the world to try to move to the

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,478
point where they're they're

120
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,960
independent standards and best practices

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
there's conformance and testing programs

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
with adequate transparency so you can

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
you can tell whether or not the major

124
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
suppliers the major operators are doing

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
what they need to do to complete to

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
conform to those requirements and

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,040
hopefully the global cyber norms of

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
conduct can also be strengthened so

129
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
there can be some consequences for

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
non-conformance

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,919
and do you believe all the respective

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,199
national information security agencies

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
even and even the labs have even the

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
capacity and and experts to do all these

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
evaluations and certifications uh in a

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
thorough way given you know the

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
absolute

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
massive volume of products that are

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
connected and

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
you know where you are not clear about

141
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
supply chain where you don't really know

142
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
where the software code comes from is

143
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
that even possible is this not something

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
that everybody talks about but they

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
don't know what this actually means in

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
reality

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
it's certainly not a single

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
touch point or checkpoint as you know

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,800
we have standards for different kinds of

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,479
products and services we have models

151
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,400
such as the common criteria model which

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
i think there are 70 or more

153
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
certified labs around the world where

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
you have a pretty good level of

155
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
assurance that the testing will be

156
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,039
similar uh the certifications will be

157
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,960
similar and that's a very good thing we

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
see in certain markets uh

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
telecommunications for example the path

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
forward of governments and private

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
companies and experts working together

162
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
with gsma and 3gbp to develop 5g

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
standards that are meaningful based on

164
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,080
the current threat environment and that

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
those standards will continue to evolve

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,840
as 5g rolls out as as the use cases of

167
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
5g roll out

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
and then you see more specifically in

169
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,039
the telecom equipment part of the

170
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
communications supply supply chain

171
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
you see the nieces the network equipment

172
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
security assurance scheme

173
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,039
that

174
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,639
the operators of the major customers we

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
and our competitors have all worked

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,319
together to come up with those standards

177
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,759
it's the first level of assurance of

178
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,199
course and we have to work toward higher

179
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,360
levels of assurance and you have the

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
early stages of getting certified labs

181
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,080
to your point that are qualified and

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
capable to do that kind of testing but

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,720
that's part of what has to evolve that's

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
part of what's going to require a

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
commitment by the companies the

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,639
operators experts and governments to say

187
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
this is what we need so that we have

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
this subjective and transparent basis

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
for knowing what's worthy of trust there

190
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
are also certain things that are of the

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
most critical most sensitive nature

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,520
where governments are going to say

193
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
they're going to be an extra level of

194
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,479
security so some of the components of of

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
the american presidents playing air

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
force one has special components where

197
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,160
even the semiconductors might be created

198
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
uh in a a special trusted lab

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
environment so that there cannot be

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
any any tampering of that but the global

201
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
community has to look together and say

202
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
okay what is the real risk what are the

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
potential consequences and what are the

204
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
costs involved and so that's why if we

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
assume that the bad guys can hack into

206
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,479
everybody the ability to move toward and

207
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,720
the requirements to move toward a zero

208
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
trust environment uh where

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
you have

210
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
multiple verification and certification

211
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599
not just at the perimeter but throughout

212
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,360
in terms of access and in terms of the

213
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
devices in terms of the business and

214
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
what it's being used for that zero trust

215
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
environment those those methods for for

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
certification uh and verification uh

217
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,800
become all the more important i think

218
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,199
we're gonna we're on a path to get there

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,720
hopefully the global community will say

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
well in certain things such as

221
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,759
telecommunications

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
we could set up meaning the global

223
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,639
community

224
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,720
independent regional testing labs for

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
major components to be tested and there

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
need to be requirements where the

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
operatives have the ability to have a

228
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
special relationship with these

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
suppliers such as huawei and our

230
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,759
competitors a special relationship where

231
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,440
they would have greater access and

232
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
greater visibility into what we do and

233
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
how we do it the kind of access that

234
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,360
that no company

235
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,199
we or nor our competitors would give

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
that kind of access to governments but

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
that kind of access to the operators so

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,039
they have an ability to know whether

239
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
what we're doing is conforming to the

240
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,559
requirements presumably there are

241
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
contractual requirements service level

242
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,839
agreements to make sure that these

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,760
things are being done but some of the

244
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,279
aspects that

245
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,599
that we take for granted within our

246
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
company but the global community needs

247
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
to focus on things like well if a

248
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,560
telecom equipment supplier has to

249
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
contract with an operator to to to do

250
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
the updates to service the equipment

251
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
there need to be policies processes and

252
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
technologies that are recognized that

253
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
that can help make sure that whether

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
when and how the equipment supplier

255
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,519
access to the customer networks and the

256
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
customer data is done in a way that's

257
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
under the complete supervision of the

258
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,040
operator that's completely verifiable

259
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
that the sessions are completely

260
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
auditable completely recorded so that

261
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,080
way we have confidence that no one is

262
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
improperly accessing the data no was no

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
one has put in back doors nobody and i

264
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,360
think a lot in the community think that

265
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
the problem of of updates is something

266
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,959
that's even a greater problem than back

267
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,320
doors although you have to test for

268
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
those but the the fact that there are

269
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
and there need to be these kinds of

270
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
requirements and processes to verify and

271
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
test uh the

272
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
the updates that go into certain

273
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
equipment we have to recognize for

274
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
example the telecom equipment is quite

275
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,440
different than some of the updates in a

276
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,680
devops kind of environment where you're

277
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
having all these updates and

278
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
automatically deployed it's done very

279
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
different in telecom sector but that is

280
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
the kind of thing that governments and

281
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
experts need to have visibility into and

282
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
there needs to be the independent

283
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
testing requirements hopefully

284
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
consensus-based standards and and so

285
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,240
that's one of the reasons i'm encouraged

286
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
that the us government uh has indicated

287
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
that they want to get more involved in

288
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
in 5g standards and i think that is

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
absolutely significant and as an

290
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
american i hope they'll also provide

291
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
some funding for american companies

292
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,880
american experts to also participate in

293
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,040
the various standards efforts because i

294
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
think having that kind of diverse

295
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,040
expertise uh and that consensus-based

296
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
approach is what's going to help us

297
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
manage the risk and move forward and get

298
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,399
the full benefits of the technology

299
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,120
um two more questions um the first one

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
is

301
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
did

302
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
uh the u.s and europe miss out on the

303
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,079
let's say r d race on in terms of 5g

304
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,120
given especially where huawei is with

305
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
their um 5dg equipment that's question

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
one and then the second question is um

307
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
do you think 5g if it's really rolled

308
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
out and it's evicus

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
significantly increases the attack

310
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,160
surface

311
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
for from a cybertech perspective or is

312
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
it

313
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,200
not that much of a big concern

314
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
well when you talk about whether the us

315
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
has missed out and i think there's been

316
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,120
quite a bit of discussion and there's a

317
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
lot of assumptions and the assumptions

318
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
may be correct i'm not sure that they

319
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
are um when you talk about the kinds of

320
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
products that we and nokia and erickson

321
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,640
and others others sell

322
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,880
the competition between us as suppliers

323
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
is quite different than

324
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,839
whether or not a country like the us

325
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,160
is working with its operators and its

326
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,200
customers to help drive forward

327
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
the technology so that the full benefits

328
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
of 5g can be realized in this case by

329
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
the united states by the citizens by the

330
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
operators by government services

331
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
and

332
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
i think some in the u.s assume that the

333
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,200
fact that the u.s doesn't have a major

334
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
telecom equipment supplier means in some

335
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,440
sense the u.s is losing out i don't

336
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,360
think that's that's a fair statement at

337
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
all i don't know whether the united

338
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
states needs a telecom equipment

339
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,880
supplier um some assume that the us does

340
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,399
i'm not so sure i mean that's one of the

341
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
reasons i'd like to see a private

342
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
sector-led technology industrial

343
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
strategy to to look at some such

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,639
questions but the ability of america to

345
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,360
say

346
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
what kind of collaboration is necessary

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
what are the various business cases that

348
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
can make the most sense what are the

349
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
kinds of rules on spectrum allocation so

350
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
that the operators don't spend so much

351
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
money to buy the spectrum they don't

352
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,160
have the money to roll out the

353
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,320
full-fledged technology i think there is

354
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,600
also um

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
a lack of understanding or incomplete

356
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
understanding about what 5g is and

357
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
obviously as we talked about before the

358
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
speed is very very important but the

359
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
latency the the lag time the ability to

360
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
connect

361
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,959
multiple connections the ability to

362
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,800
bring the computing power to the edge

363
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
and to be able to access so much from

364
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,120
the cloud um these are the kind of

365
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
things that's important to a country to

366
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
to you know to really

367
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
to really drive to drive forward uh

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
uh as as we need to uh in the future one

369
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,480
of the problems the united states should

370
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
take an example

371
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
from long ago of you know there are not

372
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
high speed trains in the united states

373
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,000
and there isn't the real full 5g of the

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
kind we're talking about that you see

375
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,839
for example in major parts of china

376
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,800
south korea and some other places

377
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
we're just used to having phones that

378
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
have you know faster download and faster

379
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
uploads in certain geographic areas but

380
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,600
the full benefits to our industrial

381
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,680
sectors to our government are yet to be

382
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
realized but we don't see it when we as

383
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
a people don't see it like we haven't

384
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
really experienced most of us haven't

385
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
experienced the great high-speed trains

386
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
like we have in europe like you have in

387
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,199
japan and so we don't push for those

388
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,519
what was your second question alexander

389
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,040
the second question was whether you

390
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,399
think

391
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,279
once 5g really becomes rolled out let's

392
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
say everywhere or

393
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,600
do you think it significantly increases

394
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,480
the attack surface or

395
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
is that not such a concern

396
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
or is it you know is it is it too much

397
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
uh

398
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
the whole 5g topic is uh

399
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,760
dominated by myths and

400
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,519
lack of really knowledge and technical

401
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
understanding

402
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
well i think it's exciting as i

403
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
mentioned in terms of the work of the

404
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
global community working together with

405
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
with

406
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
gsma and 3gbp

407
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
to develop and strengthen the standards

408
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,839
and requirements for testing

409
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
because as full 5g moves along when you

410
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
get to standalone 5g as you know there's

411
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
certain security enhancements that will

412
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,079
get the full benefit of as we move into

413
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,839
the full 5g right now we have to deal

414
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
with the traditional uh security threats

415
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,639
but that will be a different situation

416
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,120
when we get to the to the full 5g

417
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
i think there there are issues about the

418
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,079
attack service i think the dependency

419
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,920
because of the tremendous benefits that

420
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,360
the technologies are going to be

421
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
bringing um

422
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,160
benefiting

423
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,000
reducing the the carbon footprint

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
including increasing the efficiency of

425
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
manufacturing uh green energy is going

426
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,480
to be helped uh the smart farming is

427
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,839
going to be i mean there's just so many

428
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,920
ways that way of life's are going to be

429
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,079
affected and as you use this automation

430
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,440
the sensor essentially the machine

431
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
machine communications they're going to

432
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,240
be things that are going to be

433
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
responding and so

434
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,639
that dependency requires what i think

435
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
we're seeing is the collaboration that

436
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,639
come up with using principles of zero

437
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
trust and actual implementations of zero

438
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
trust and the greater authentication

439
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,600
mechanisms are gonna help address that

440
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,920
greater risk so i think yes there's a

441
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
larger footprint particularly with

442
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
internet of things generally

443
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
but the greater dependency is something

444
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
that uh we have to and we can address

445
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,639
this in a comprehensive manner because

446
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,320
this is the kind of stuff that you know

447
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
when i left the white house staff in

448
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
early 2003 we were talking a good game

449
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,639
in the united states about cyber

450
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,279
security and in the 26 countries i've

451
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,920
visited since i joined huawei uh you

452
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,279
know there are different degrees of

453
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
recognition of the importance of cyber

454
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,279
security but as we move into 5g enabled

455
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,759
technologies and the greater use of of

456
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,480
cloud we see a whole different world

457
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
where cyber security and privacy

458
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
protection

459
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
is going to be increasingly important

460
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
and so we have to make sure we can

461
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,160
address that risk and that there's

462
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
sufficient transparency

463
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
and measures and mechanisms for

464
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
accountability so organizations and

465
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,399
individuals can be held accountable if

466
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
they don't meet their requirements so

467
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,519
that way they're incentivized to meet

468
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,759
those requirements

469
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,399
all right
