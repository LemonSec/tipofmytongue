1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
okay so i'm joe hoback uh i work for a

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
company called uh istari uh we're a

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,519
cyber security company and i'm the emea

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,080
md and also run our global academy where

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
we work on cyber resilience leadership

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,720
but the thing i'm here to do today is to

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,520
share

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
the story of some independent research i

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,920
did before i was with history but i've

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
carried on since joining history

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
into cyber security technology efficacy

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,840
and whether or not cyber security is

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,279
really working

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
um now the story starts a couple of

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,600
years ago

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,760
and it started as a bit of a hobby

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,040
project of mine between jobs um i was

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
triggered by

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,480
the difference

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
in the way in which the private sector

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,039
on one hand and then the secure

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
government sector on the other hand

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
by cyber security

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,840
uh observed that in the financial sector

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
in other commercial spaces cyber

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,399
security is bought based on some sense

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,960
of functionalities or some you know

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,799
analyst report that says this is the hot

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
new thing whereas cyber security in the

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
government sector and secure government

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
especially is bought based on whether or

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
not it really works and so an rfp from

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
the government will have a clear

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
definition of security requirements and

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
the levels of security required and the

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
efficacy of the solution whereas the

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479
private sector is much more about does

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,960
it have this feature am i me achieving

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
compliance and i was triggered by that

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
difference and wanted to understand it

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
so what started as a hobby is turned

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,560
into a

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
a two year long and much bigger thing

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
than i expected so i started doing some

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,040
interviews and i'm trying to understand

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
you know why the different parties were

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
behaving in this way uh and and what was

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
going on underneath this difference and

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,759
the

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,159
what started to emerge was something

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,880
that helps explain why

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
cyber security technology still has

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
major challenges around efficacy

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,520
and how

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,960
we have the situation where we're

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
spending more and more money on cyber

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
security every year but we're still

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
suffering more and more attacks every

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,920
year so what is one of the underlying

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,520
issues in here

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,239
and it what surfaced um from the

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,680
interviews i did

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
was that

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
more than 90

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
of the 100 plus people i spoke to in the

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,319
end

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,160
had suffered real issues with the

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,040
efficacy of security technologies they

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,519
bought now i started out thinking i

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
might speak to 10 or 15 people but this

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
work just cascaded as i met more and

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
more people i spoke to csos i spoke to

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
cios i spoke to company ceos i spoke to

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
security vendors technology vendors

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,519
regulators assessment organizations and

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,360
and everywhere i went i was passed on to

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
someone else who said oh you must talk

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
to so-and-so they've got a great

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,120
perspective on this

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
and so in the end i ended up speaking to

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,040
more than 100 people

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
and and discovered that something that

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
we may feel

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
in our bones about the market and the

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,040
problems we face with cyber security

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,400
is a much

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,440
more real and an endemic problem around

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
the efficacy of the solutions we're

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,319
buying

90
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,280
um

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,760
so more than 90 of people had said they

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
have a problem with efficacy

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
now two interesting things came out

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
firstly you know what do we mean by

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
cyber security efficacy

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
and the cohort of people basically

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
aligned on a general definition which

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,239
says

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
cyber security is effective if

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
it does what it promises to do

101
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
it's operationally usable in an

102
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
enterprise environment so it's you don't

103
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
need to be some kind of fighter pilot to

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,560
fly it and make it work

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
it's got the quality in its security

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
architecture and build that it's not

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
full of vulnerabilities and the security

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
vendor themselves is secure and they

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,799
don't create a vulnerability for the

110
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
product so that definition of efficacy

111
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
of cyber security emerged

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
but the other thing that was really

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
interesting was that the problem with

114
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
cyber security technology

115
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
isn't actually a limitation of

116
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,080
technology

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,480
it's an economics problem and that's why

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
i titled the report cyber security

119
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
technology efficacy is cyber security

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
the new market for lemons

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
because this

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,839
lack of efficacy is driven not by humans

123
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,399
inability to create secure technologies

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,240
it's driven by the market incentives

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,479
between the vendors and the buyers

126
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,199
and the information asymmetry that

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,919
exists between the vendor and the buyer

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,840
the vendor has a lot more information

129
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
than the buyer about the solutions

130
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,120
they're buying

131
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
and that creates perverse incentives

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,520
that means that solutions come to the

133
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
market which which lack efficacy

134
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,280
now having spoken to so many people

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
anonymously and confidentially

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
i i picked up some really interesting

137
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,759
sort of insights and findings now

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
unfortunately

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
and obviously i'm not going to name

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
companies that people mentioned but it

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
was quite amusing the amount of times

142
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,960
various big dang brands were mentioned

143
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
as having real issues with their

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
efficacy

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
so it was really quite enlightening

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
understanding this

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
now the challenge remains how do you

148
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
actually fix this efficacy problem um

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,240
and so i i published my report and uh

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
thought okay well i've you know i found

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,000
this thing i've confirmed what some

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
people had talked about for years of the

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
issues in the market and now we have the

154
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
evidence of the scale of the problem

155
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
but since that since i launched the

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,919
report in october 2020 i've been really

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,880
shocked by the um reception it's had and

158
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
the the number of people that i never

159
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
i've never met who come to me and say oh

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
i read your report it's it's it's bang

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,639
on it's exactly right it's a fair

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,160
representation of what's going on and we

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
need to solve this problem i mean we've

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
been lucky enough to have had um great

165
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
support from uh professor kieran martin

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
ex head of the uk ncsc

167
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
um who is who's sort of bought into the

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,639
concept and is working uh with me

169
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
on trying to solve this problem so okay

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
the problem exists we have to some

171
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,319
extent to market for lemons but how do

172
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
we actually solve this how do we

173
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
correct those that imbalance in

174
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
incentives and the in information

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
asymmetry

176
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,039
so kieran has since uh together with me

177
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
written a kind of response to the report

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
which is calling for a safer

179
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
cyber security charter

180
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
which is about creating transparency and

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,919
leveling up that playing field between

182
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
the buyer and the server in cyber

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
security which would create the

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,000
incentives um to improve the efficacy of

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
solutions in the market

186
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
um i have to say obviously i i i work on

187
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,000
the the vendor side so uh i'm the

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
skeptic or the the

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
poacher turned game keeper but i my

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
sense is that

191
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
from the conversations i had with the

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
security vendors

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
all of the leadership of security

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,039
companies believe in what they're doing

195
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,240
and they all think it's the other

196
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
companies who have the efficacy issues

197
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,479
so there is even a sense within the

198
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,080
security market

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
that we need to focus on the efficacy of

200
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,240
our technology

201
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,039
and

202
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,120
everybody feels a frustration about the

203
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
amount that's being spent on marketing

204
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,599
and sales that should be being spent on

205
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
development and technology and improving

206
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,160
the efficacy of solutions for everyone

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
in the market

208
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,280
so

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
in conclusion having started out

210
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,960
thinking i was going to do a sort of

211
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
four week

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
piece of hobby work understanding what's

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
this difference between

214
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,639
the secure government environment where

215
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
security is paramount uh versus the

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
private sector where it's about

217
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
compliance and and achieving features

218
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
and functions

219
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
it's resulted in a much bigger piece of

220
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,960
work uh and many more interactions with

221
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,360
interesting people in regulatory

222
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
employees around the world in vendors in

223
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
buying organizations around the world

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,199
but the challenge remains how do we

225
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
actually fix this and and i'm looking

226
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
for

227
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,599
anybody who wants to collaborate and

228
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
discuss and debate on on how to improve

229
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
this and kieran and i

230
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
uh are pushing this charter but we would

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
value anybody's input into how we can

232
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,280
help resolve this market for lemons

233
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,680
issue which we think is is is one of the

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
uh underlying reasons that cyber

235
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,080
security remains such a challenge

236
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,800
so

237
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,039
please do feel free to reach out and the
