to an end i too wish you a warm welcome

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,000
cyber security is a fundamentally

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
important issue

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
cyber security has many dimensions it

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,359
concerns

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
every one of us

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,519
our society the economy the national

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
security and the safety of the

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
international and global

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
community

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
the latest cyber attacks

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,640
on

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
ukrainian energy providers and

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,440
government i.t systems

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
are an alarming

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,280
example

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
nowadays

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,039
cyber attacks cyber security and cyber

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,239
defense

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,079
can be a matter

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,280
of war

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
or peace

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
germany took over the g7 presidency at

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
the start

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
of 2022

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
alongside climate change and the

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,439
coronavirus

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
cyber security is on top of the agenda

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,159
and that is really necessary

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
cyber security has to be

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,920
a top priority in global politics

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
it has to be also a top priority for

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
every single state

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,520
this includes national cyber defense

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,799
abilities

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,520
and the protection of critical

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
infrastructures like

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,240
hospitals water and energy supply or

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,640
telecommunication

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
i think we must make a greater effort to

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,159
this in this area

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
cybersecurity also has a huge impact on

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
our societies

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,560
a digital world with almost no borders

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,759
offers a lot of opportunities

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
but is it is also vulnerable

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,840
cyber attacks can lead also to civilian

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,038
victims and may even destabilize

52
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,318
society

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,879
for instance due to breach of public

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
order

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,680
fake news

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
supply shortages

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
loss of life critical medical devices in

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
hospitals

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
cyber security also has

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
economical dimension on top of that

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,920
cyber attacks

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
are a real and often underestimated

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
danger to companies

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
according to a recent corporate risk

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,440
survey

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
cyber incidents are the number one

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
concern to large companies the number

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
one concern

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,519
ransomware and other disruptive forms of

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,000
cyber tax continued to put a strain on

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,319
businesses worldwide

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,599
experts estimates that

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,159
cyber attacks caused a worldwide

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
financial damage to businesses

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
in the amount of six trillion dollars

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
in 2021

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,879
until the year 2025

78
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
financial damages are expected to rise

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
to over 10 trillion dollars

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
any company can be the target of cyber

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
criminals

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
big middle-sized and small

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,959
businesses alike

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,680
up-to-date cyber security technology and

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
backups are essential to

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
every business

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,280
however

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
a big risk for businesses with regard to

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,239
cyber security

90
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
are also their own

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
employees

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
cyber criminals increasingly try try to

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,480
target employees with methods like

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
fishing or sea offroad

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
therefore

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,519
it is very important to make sure that

97
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,040
all employees are aware of possible

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
cyber attacks

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
every state has the responsibility to

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,360
optimize their anti-cyber crime

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
structures the bavarian ministry of

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
justice

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
and our public prosecutors

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,600
made the fight against cybercrime a top

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
priority

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,040
in

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,120
2015 we established a central cybercrime

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
unit

109
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
it is a highly specialized unit which is

110
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,720
responsible

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
for investigating severe cyber crimes

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,600
all over bavaria

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,680

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,720

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,440
international partners for example with

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
international cyber security infra

119
