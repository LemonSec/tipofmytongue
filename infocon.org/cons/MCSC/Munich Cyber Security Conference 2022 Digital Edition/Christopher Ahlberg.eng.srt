to the

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
munich cyber security conference

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,120
digital edition

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,440
and we invited

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
today for our talking heads session

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,039
christopher eilberg

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
from a company called he co founded in

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,800
2009 called recorded future which

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
by its name uh touches already uh upon

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,079
an important um subject that we will be

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
discussing today um about the future

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
about the future of cyber security and

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,480
strategies in mitigating cyber risks

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
and um

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
christopher uh is um been involved with

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
with uh data analytics and uh and an

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,039
extension

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,960
uh the the

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,840
sort of

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,399
intelligence of threats and threat

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,000
analytics for for over 30 years

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
he has a phd in computer science and

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,479
and was actually as a member of the

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,159
royal swedish academy he's originally

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,680
from sweden but now

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,159
founded his company in boston

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,960
and

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,479
in massachusetts and um

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,880
yeah is recall the future if you will

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,000
look it up

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
has

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
you know the philosophy not of the of of

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
a sort of a narrow

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
uh uh i would you know what you can see

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
many times the very narrow focused um

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
i t security uh threat detection but it

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
is actually a much more global approach

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,399
they will use all all kinds of data

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
sources uh

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
actually as the internet itself he will

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
explain in a minute and um

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,040
and that makes the quality of the

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
outcome and of the information

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
they will be able to

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
source

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
much more relevant much more relevant in

48
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,640
our efforts to mitigate cyber risks um

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,439
he

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,440
recorded future is also um uh you know a

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
first

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
source for many intelligence agencies um

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
across the world across the globe um so

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,120
that's how we met and um so i'm very

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
happy that you could find time today for

56
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,000
us to give us

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
yeah give us some insights

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,879
uh and uh perspective

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,080
uh on on on this on this subject welcome

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
uh thank you for joining you're you're

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
meeting us now from from gothenburg in

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,440
sweden that's that's fantastic and uh so

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
we are in the same time zone and makes

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,720
it easier

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,599
um

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,440
yeah christopher do you want to add

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
anything from from your uh about

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
yourself i mean i try to very

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,000
thank you so much it's great thank you

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
yeah thank you

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
and when we before when we started

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
discussing this this talk um i thought

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
maybe we could uh

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,120
look at at recent developments i mean

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,560
you've been looking at this for for many

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,760
many years but do you do you see um some

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
some different qualities or some

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
different major trends or developments

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
recently uh with regard to cyberspreads

80
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
is that something that you that you

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
observe

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,879
if you think about it we just this very

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
moment in time with with sort of russia

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
you know putting 100 000 troops on the

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
border of ukraine which obviously hits

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,640
at the the heartland of europe if you

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
want and and the sort of activities

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,920
around it where we've seen hacktivism

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
against belarusian trains and and and

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
you know ransomware hitting german

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
fuel production here you know it's

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,720
pretty interesting so so first of all

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,159
again i've done this for a long time so

94
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
you you trade try to look back and

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,799
figure out like what's the baseline the

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
baseline i think cyber criminals and

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
there's a whole lot of them many of them

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
are in russia but they're also in china

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
they're in in brazil they might be in

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,879
nigeria frankly some of them are going

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
to be in germany and the us and sweden

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
probably too

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,439
police have defenders arresting them a

104
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
little bit faster there

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
but you know

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,040
so cyber criminals they want to make

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840
money always remember that spice wants

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
to steal secrets that's sort of always

109
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
remember that as your as your baseline

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
and even when you're a company that

111
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
informs you because you think about or

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,680
spies looking to come after me are cyber

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
criminals looking to come after me and

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
depending on what you do that that will

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
inform you in some interesting ways so

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,199
just having that sort of based on um

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
these regardless if i'm a spy or or i'm

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
a criminal uh i'm gonna send boat loads

119
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
of phishing emails you know that's sort

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
of interesting sort of basic point of

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
how they all sort of start this stuff

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
ransomware you know came up i don't know

123
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
people will actually say ransomware's

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
first ransomware was sort of launched 20

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
30 years ago but you know over the last

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
five years or so

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
it's been incredibly prevalent and it's

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,639
interesting because that sort of like

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
maybe there's some convergence between

130
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,919
the criminals and maybe a little

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,000
donation state and that continues to be

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
a very profitable way of making money um

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
i think it's interesting over you know

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
the recent times here obviously the the

135
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,759
biden administration in the u.s have put

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
a higher emphasis on cyber if you want

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
than i think any administration in the

138
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
us have ever done it may be that any

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
administration has done anywhere maybe

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,320
you know we could talk about that but

141
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
but so the quality of the people that

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
have been put in and the ability of them

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
to push an agenda around this has been

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
pretty interesting but even with all of

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
that i think it's also just the state

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
from the beginning we're very early in

147
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,199
in trying to do something about this

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,520
threat here uh you know churchill like

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
speed point would be that we're only in

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
the maybe at the end of the beginning

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
sort of thing you know like there's a

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
lot to fix here because we've built an

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,039
internet that is frankly is insecure and

154
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,800
it connects everything and when you have

155
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
something that is insecure and it

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
connects everything it's not a good

157
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
combination and we'll come back and talk

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,840
about that that's

159
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,199
uh basic things i think you know

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
hacktivism being back i think a couple

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,039
of years many of us including ourselves

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,400
we wrote off activism belarusian cyber

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
partners as they call themselves was

164
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
able to shut down railroads

165
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,199
transporting potentially russian troops

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,039
in belarus you know that's you know

167
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
that's that's certainly very interesting

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
but i'll just wrap it up by saying that

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
with this sort of what's going on in

170
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
ukraine i think we're seeing something

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
if you want to say what's going on right

172
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
now this convergence between physical

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,759
threats

174
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
disinformation and cyber threats

175
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
happening at a pace like this that

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,800
convergence we've talked about for years

177
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
at recorded future it's happening right

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
in front of us

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,639
it whether this conflict actually turns

180
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
kinetic you know people shooting at each

181
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,639
other this will be the sort of the

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
takeaway from that and it's a future

183
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
that we all have to get ready for

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
yeah so that's so this convergence

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,039
you're mentioning um

186
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
you meant the baseline that there's

187
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,960
there's one motivation that could be the

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
cyber criminals they're looking

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,560
practically for money and maybe uh i

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
remember a talk by a caesar from from an

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
important bank and they said you know

192
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
the attacks are happening where the

193
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
money is and and that's our are the

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,280
banks so they they've been dealing with

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
those with those kind of risks for for a

196
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,479
number of decades and uh and then you

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
have those others who are after secrets

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,919
and knowledge and and and and trying to

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
to access those um

200
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,319
treasures and now we have i mean you

201
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
know anne neuberger cyber security uh

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,479
white house uh director she

203
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,520
now traveled to to brussels uh to meet

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,080
her uh colleagues from nato

205
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,479
because they think um

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
as you say um there could be a sort of a

207
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,960
a prelude that happens through cyber

208
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,720
activities um to any kinetic uh

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
activity so

210
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
either prelude or as it unravels and

211
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
it's gonna go fast and we saw that with

212
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,160
non-petya that probably was a somewhat

213
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
targeted attack in ukraine that went

214
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,039
wrong and this boom spread

215
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
and and that's sort of why it's scary

216
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
not to be a scaremonger but that is i

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
think why we're all sort of thinking

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
that we need to take that very seriously

219
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
coming to this um observation uh you

220
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,840
know you have an insecure internet when

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,919
everything connected to it um you know

222
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,039
we we

223
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,839
we all know the term of uh uh transition

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,080
to digital technologies and and the

225
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
internet of things the industrial

226
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
internet of things and everything is

227
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
connected as you say um

228
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
so that is a basic flaw because

229
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
obviously the internet as as we know it

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
was not designed to be uh doing all that

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,399
what that it's doing now or it's used

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
for um

233
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,320
do you

234
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,399
what what so what yeah what is the

235
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,640
solution then is it to accept it and

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
just to understand those risks and and

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
and kind of be prepared to you know to

238
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
work on the resilience part that we are

239
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
prepared and and if something happens we

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
you know what to do or do you see also

241
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
some you know developments that that

242
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
this this basic flaw that the internet

243
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
itself was not using secure protocols

244
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,519
and and and uh you know

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
all kinds of um you know technologies

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,440
um

247
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
would be also

248
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,399
possible to fix

249
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
no it's it's very very interesting um so

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
so i you know you've heard me say this

251
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,640
point before the world have sort of the

252
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
the internet sort of become a reflection

253
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
of the world over the last 25 years

254
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
money systems lots of things have slowly

255
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
migrated onto the internet during the

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,839
next 25 years this flips

257
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
and the world becomes a reflection of

258
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,480
the internet so we're only at the start

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
now i do think that we should remember

260
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
to be an optimist but you know whether

261
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
the internet started in 1971 or whatever

262
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
we put the time point of for many of us

263
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
it really started sort of in the early

264
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
90s with web browsers and all that sort

265
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
of stuff whatever wherever you put to

266
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
start just think about the economic

267
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
developments and the sort of the the

268
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
tremendous developments that happen in

269
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
the time frame you know with with you

270
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
know actually not just in economics but

271
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
politics and lots of really good things

272
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,399
are

273
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
bad things also but the you know there

274
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,440
are people

275
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,800
you know hundreds of millions maybe

276
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,079
billions of people have come out of

277
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
poverty during those time frames you

278
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
know enormous progress they've done in

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,519
the world being made in the world and

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,079
i'm a fundamental optimist and partially

281
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,079
the inner or the internet carries a lot

282
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
of that sort of with it the the ability

283
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,320
to connect trade and connect politics

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,560
and connect lots of really good things

285
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,160
and you could argue that

286
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
maybe a much heavier protocol maybe a

287
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,279
you know more sort of controlled

288
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
internet would have been better

289
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,360
but frankly it probably never would have

290
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
been happened then it would have been

291
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
enough not to ding or dear french

292
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,560
friends but it would have been a dear

293
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
sort of a french minitel or something

294
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
and yes could not have gone sort of as

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
far so now

296
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,560
are there things we could do

297
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
fundamentally to the internet to make it

298
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,959
better more secure and the devices we

299
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,959
connect to it of course but there are

300
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,440
i'm sort of i'm not the network protocol

301
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
designer expert but there are things we

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
can do and but the problem is that it's

303
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,040
not just you know it's not just the

304
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
network protocol it's not the ip we fix

305
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
the ipv go from ipv4 ipv4 yes it's

306
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,440
better there's a lot

307
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,399
to untangle in this and and the

308
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,680
insecurities is sort of it's it's

309
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,279
so many things that i like to always

310
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,800
bring up that you know a lot of the

311
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
stuff that has now been bad in politics

312
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
comes from the ability of the internet

313
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
to be used as a micro targeting engine

314
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
that goes straight into our heads and so

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,320
that's

316
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
that's sort of

317
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,440
you know it's not as insecure in the

318
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
protocol this is like what the internet

319
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
has enabled so if you want to unravel

320
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
all of that and you'd basically put us

321
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
back in in cave in case again so you're

322
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,839
not going to unravel it but it's it's

323
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,360
going to take a long time to fix i think

324
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
that's the

325
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
conclusion

326
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
okay so and of course

327
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
we have maybe a

328
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,360
if i understand you correctly um also

329
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
as you said the world is reflected in

330
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
the internet and the and our and the

331
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
behavior and the way we use it so it's

332
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,279
also

333
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,560
uh

334
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,519
the awareness and the knowledge that we

335
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
we know what we're doing and how we're

336
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
doing it and so that that goes along and

337
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
and you know you mentioned in the

338
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
beginning this information is also a

339
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
phenomena that that that you can

340
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
increasingly uh uh being

341
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
instrumentalized for for for all kinds

342
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,399
of purposes

343
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,760
that we've been knowing also in the

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
offline world

345
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,720
you know back

346
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
with the radio and the

347
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
movie propaganda so it's it's not it's

348
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
not new to humankind um

349
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
still um

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,920
we see this migration to sort of cloud

351
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
services you know that the companies

352
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
sort of or governments

353
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,120
you know

354
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,680
let let providers take care of of their

355
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,839
data

356
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,720
applications and services and systems um

357
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
and and of course we all know although

358
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
we have this nice background picture

359
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,000
with the clouds and the title of the

360
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
conference is drifting clouds innovative

361
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
perspectives on

362
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,279
you know um

363
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,000
evolving cyber threats but um

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
we know that the cloud in the end is a

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
is a computational center it is you know

366
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,760
the data are are going in in sub

367
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
marine cables

368
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
so and togo the poor you know with the

369
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,920
volcano and they got cut off and then

370
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
there's no internet and there's nothing

371
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
and and and

372
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
despite all the clouds in in the sky so

373
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,320
uh

374
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
um

375
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
what's uh so do you think this is um

376
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
just a logical you know a development

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
that that that we rely on those

378
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,320
specialized providers um and and it

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
doesn't really make a difference in

380
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
terms of cyber security or even it does

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,199
because they are uh more better prepared

382
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,120
and so what would be your view on i

383
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
think the i would say so first of all

384
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
you're right that it's sort of all of

385
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,240
this have happened i think companies

386
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,519
bring large

387
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
organizations governments you know

388
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,880
organizations

389
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
have sort of you think but the risk they

390
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
have in into your point cloud risk or

391
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,480
hosting risk uh hardware risk and

392
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,880
software risk if you sort of add those

393
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,279
three things up and you say is there a

394
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,959
single company

395
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
regardless if it's a german bank or a

396
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
american manufacturing company or a

397
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
japanese

398
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
whatever

399
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,839
is there a single company on the planet

400
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
who really have a good grip on that risk

401
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,480
today probably not and you know frankly

402
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
this is why we started recording future

403
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
we wanted to help these companies get

404
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
better intelligence better information

405
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
but you know i think there's tremendous

406
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,320
risk sitting in this

407
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
and so far it's the bad guys who've been

408
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
able to take advantage of this because

409
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,399
you're a hacker in mom's basement in

410
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,760
oremborg

411
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,079
you you suddenly can scan the internet

412
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:04,880
with

413
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,480
super high speed and just find

414
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
everything that is vulnerable and then

415
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
you sort of

416
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,800
optimistically go after what's

417
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
vulnerable you land on a german

418
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
fuel

419
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,199
whatever sort of that's right yeah

420
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
whatever's open yes exactly we didn't

421
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
even know what company was but that's

422
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
right so but i think you know companies

423
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,399
around the world have under-invested in

424
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
cyber security and and they've sort of

425
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
and what's happened during the last five

426
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,040
years here if we sort of say that things

427
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
have accelerated is that a lot of

428
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,160
classic sort of security hygiene went

429
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,519
out of the window because it's sort of

430
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,920
like you just again you let this risk

431
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
migrate onto your cloud provider you're

432
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
you know into new kinds of software you

433
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
just oh they'll sort it but they won't

434
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
and and it just means that companies

435
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
have not invested enough in this we've

436
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,839
sort of uh if you if this was the

437
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
equivalent of security

438
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,959
that you know mercedes might put into

439
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,040
you know cars or

440
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
you know nuclear industry might put into

441
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
whatever where where i think just

442
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
companies have under invest invested in

443
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
this or maybe not apply the money in a

444
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,360
smart way in some cases it's the one one

445
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,199
k in some cases the other but it just

446
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,199
needs to be taken more seriously and

447
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,920
we're in an early journey of that and

448
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,040
we'll nail it we'll figure it out the uh

449
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
this can be a combination of technical

450
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
things it's gonna be a combination of

451
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
actually getting to that guy in or the

452
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
basement of orenberg eventually we'll

453
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
have to collaborate with the russians on

454
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
what it means to arrest that guy we'll

455
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
just have to figure that out

456
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
and and we'll get to it but it's it's

457
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,480
going to be a long journey

458
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
you mentioned

459
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
you know exactly

460
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,959
the basement and they launched their

461
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,079
automated

462
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,480
scanning systems and to and then they

463
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
detect vulnerabilities and and will

464
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
launch and malware will start its

465
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
its mission um

466
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
on the defense side i mean especially

467
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,959
now also talking from your from your uh

468
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
current activity

469
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
is there any hope or any you know a

470
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,400
counter technology i mean can we also um

471
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
uh make better use of um you know

472
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
evolving technologies um machine

473
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,280
learning um i don't know

474
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,119
sort of automated analytical algorithms

475
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,280
that help to detect

476
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
um you know anomalies or or movements

477
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,480
that that are maybe uh susceptible of

478
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
being

479
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
not part of their of their normal

480
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,760
behavior i don't know

481
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
what is your do you think there is some

482
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
we are on the verge or we have already

483
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,240
passed a certain a certain milestone and

484
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
we we can rely on such systems in

485
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,360
combination as you said with with other

486
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
with other aspects and tools i would i

487
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,000
would say first you know the optimist in

488
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
me will say yes

489
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
uh in terms of that we can we're not

490
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,160
there yet but we can that's one but then

491
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
there's a but

492
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
that says that you're dealing with

493
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
enormous complexity and anybody who

494
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
thinks that one solution to enormous

495
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,919
complexity has never happened it doesn't

496
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,440
matter if it's computers or something

497
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
else

498
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,919
you're never going to have the sort of

499
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
the bulletproof sort of approach to

500
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,120
solving anybody who claims that is is um

501
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
is being stupid and we're just going to

502
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,840
be stupid now on the other hand i do

503
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,480
think i like this uh comment that what's

504
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
his name rob joyce

505
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
who you know runs now cyber security for

506
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
the nsa this the cyber defense side of

507
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
things and he gave the speech at i think

508
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
it was the use next conference for five

509
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
years ago when he was in a prior role

510
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
that it was a little bit slightly more

511
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
offensive

512
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,919
and and uh

513
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,880
he he said look basic lesson for any

514
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,679
defender of networks is you need to know

515
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,400
your network better than the bad guy and

516
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,720
again the the problem becomes when the

517
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,960
guy in the basement is probably a guy

518
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,640
not always but

519
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
in the basement in oremberg when he can

520
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,720
quickly know the network better than the

521
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
defender

522
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,559
at

523
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,480
you know company x

524
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
whether it's in germany or nigeria or

525
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,039
the us that becomes a problem

526
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,120
and we also know we have high turnover

527
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
i.t staff and so on so the guy knows the

528
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
network better now but the good news

529
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
here is that there is data and you know

530
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
we worked part of this to to sort of

531
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
help people organize that data so you

532
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,720
can you know and once you have data

533
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
now i think what you're saying makes

534
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,000
sense because now i can whether it's

535
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,240
sort of looking for anomalous in in the

536
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
sort of

537
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
uh you know just basics you know there's

538
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
an open port here basically i left the

539
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
door open i should know that it's just

540
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,320
not it doesn't take ai or machine

541
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
learning or right right

542
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,080
tells me so let's do something about

543
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,559
that all the way over to where you know

544
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
you you you to your point use more

545
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
advanced methods and whether it's from

546
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,240
the statistics book or or the ai book i

547
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
don't really care

548
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,559
but yes we we're going to be able to use

549
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,960
more advanced analytical methods to

550
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
bring together data and make life

551
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,559
miserable for the guy make it really

552
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,440
hard make it you know more resilient but

553
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
also at the same time you know make it

554
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,240
so that that guy have to go elsewhere

555
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
and eventually we'll trip up and and get

556
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,559
arrested and if we do this sort of as a

557
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,919
combination

558
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,159
resiliency shutting down the worst just

559
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,640
making it sort of had less less open

560
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
doors to go after

561
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,559
make it so that we can deter in you know

562
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,480
our world so that we can sort of make

563
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
him go elsewhere and then also combining

564
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,360
that with the the some other aspects of

565
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,559
and which will probably be more

566
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,720
countries doing of making more logical

567
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,799
so we get them arrested we're gonna make

568
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,320
you know we'll make strides we'll make

569
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,520
progress

570
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,480
wonderful actually you got us already

571
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
some practical advice know your network

572
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
and uh you know uh

573
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,880
as a number one point in in order to be

574
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
able to defend it

575
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
but yeah that that's that's an important

576
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
point or maybe not have everything

577
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
connected that maybe doesn't need to be

578
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,720
connected or or isolated networks you

579
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,039
know those cyber hygiene

580
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,000
basics but um again

581
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,840
and also as you said be prepared and

582
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
in case you have some incident and and

583
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,200
be able to

584
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,360
um to react and and um know what to do

585
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,480
practically

586
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,320
what's going on around yes

587
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
you know what's going on right now in

588
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,799
ukraine informs us that we

589
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,799
as whether and this goes all the way to

590
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,760
ceos of companies that you know what's

591
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
going on in ukraine you need to as a ceo

592
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
i'm not talking about the i.t guy here

593
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,679
but the ceo of any company that does

594
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,799
business beyond their village basically

595
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,840
need to ask questions to their their i.t

596
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
staff and their security staff and say

597
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
what's the implication do we have

598
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
suppliers that touch ukraine you know i

599
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,400
really ask pretty basic questions you

600
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
know don't be intimidated and don't let

601
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
the i.t guy intimidate you with lots of

602
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,520
sort of

603
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
marvel garble sort of stuff but just

604
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,080
basic questions are we you know will

605
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,919
ukraine impact us and if they just said

606
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
nah they won't then okay too simple tell

607
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,280
me again tell me why it won't and and

608
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
really sort of by basic questionnaire

609
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,240
screen any ceo of worth there you know

610
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
whatever should be able to do that and

611
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
and i think that's maybe part of it that

612
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,720
take this seriously

613
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,840
great um is there i mean our audience is

614
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,559
mainly consisting also of you know board

615
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,559
members and

616
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
people management

617
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
it doesn't matter in the public or the

618
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,120
private domain

619
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,440
responsible for their organizations and

620
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,000
decisions and also the risk management

621
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
in the end it's risk management i

622
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
understand

623
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
um so your advice

624
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
would be to uh to to really look at at

625
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,559
the developments and to be aware but

626
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,919
also

627
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,080
you know we hear about the supply chain

628
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
you know the ecosystems that you have

629
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,679
suppliers you have customers you're

630
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,600
you're in the middle of of those

631
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
connections uh business connections

632
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
uh is there a and uh

633
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
point that you want to make uh also in

634
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,679
that respect i think the point again is

635
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,799
that the

636
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,000
the vocabulary vocabulary ends up being

637
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,960
so

638
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
dis

639
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
disconnected between the so the ceos and

640
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,799
the boards of uh you know if you have a

641
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
significant company a large you know

642
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
large german insurance company

643
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,400
whatever

644
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,159
i'm just making this up and you know the

645
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,360
ceo and the board or the cfo you know

646
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
they traffic they'll understand risk for

647
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,679
sure they might you know any insurance

648
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,760
companies can understand risk as well as

649
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,640
anybody

650
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,600
and and but then cyber then and they'll

651
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,440
have a risk register i don't know what

652
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
that's called in german but they'll have

653
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
the 50 lines and then do we have cyber

654
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,279
risk will be one line item and if you're

655
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,240
lucky there'll be two and and but then

656
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,520
you know and they'll

657
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,919
maybe ask the i.t manager look there

658
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,200
seems to be a lot of stuff going on in

659
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
ukraine tell me more and then the idea

660
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
manager the c stoke what are you going

661
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,240
to call it

662
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,980
shows up with

663
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,720
[Music]

664
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
like you know just like get into these

665
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,240
details and and then the ceo the cfo

666
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,679
just drifts

667
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,600
yeah this got boring

668
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,520
and and sounds like either he has it

669
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,840
under control and okay great but i think

670
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,720
there is something in in connecting uh

671
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
business and being able to inform the

672
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
business so that's the responsibility of

673
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,320
the

674
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,960
itt and the security teams to be able to

675
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
inform the business in a way that is

676
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,120
meaningful and likewise it's up to and

677
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
this is maybe more important it's it's

678
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,000
up to the ceo of that insurance company

679
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,799
to

680
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,440
to be able to ask meaningful questions

681
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,400
back and don't let people get into all

682
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,279
the you know i.t stuff but but you know

683
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
keep it at level where actually that

684
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
discussion can

685
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,279
uh can can meet and that you then

686
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
actually have a sense of understanding

687
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
that yes we do actually have risk in

688
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
poland where we have subsidiaries uh

689
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,720
that are connected back to our home

690
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,080
office and that have suppliers in

691
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,799
ukraine and the network connectivity is

692
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,760
such that we could be at risk and okay

693
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,279
if something happens what do we do about

694
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
it do we have the ability to cut that

695
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,240
wire do we have backups

696
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
you you just they can quickly go down

697
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
the rabbit hole but you can also keep it

698
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
at a way where actually i think ceos

699
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,240
could have great impact on that but

700
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
seldomly do that

701
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,559
christopher arbuck thank you so much for

702
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,440
your time and your insights uh on this

703
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
uh evolving uh cyber threat picture um

704
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
it's it's been a pleasure and a

705
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,120
privilege talking to you

706
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,679
and um i hope to meet you

707
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,919
soon also in person once we are able to

708
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
do this again as a plenary conference

709
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,240
and uh to hear more about um the

710
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,679
experience you have and uh and also

711
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
you know the um the strategies and the

712
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,799
best practice to to call it a way um

713
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,039
that that show um

714
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,600
you know some some success you mentioned

715
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
law enforcement of course the guy in the

716
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
basement and

717
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,360
and and wherever he is should not feel

718
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,000
uh sort of untouchable he should be also

719
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,039
uh

720
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,320
you know and um and in a way maybe

721
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,919
you mentioned another important

722
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,480
complexity those things are complex but

723
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
they should also get more complex for

724
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,600
those attackers

725
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,000
so to be more difficult and more quick

726
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
find more effort and law enforcement

727
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
complexity and we'll be able to go at it

728
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,159
so that's thank you very much for having

729
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,919

730
