1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,160
yeah thank you very much uh mr sum for

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
the kind introduction excellencies

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
ladies and gentlemen it's a privilege to

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,400
join you here from munich and be part of

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,920
this esteemed gathering

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
from interpol's perspective the past two

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,599
years have been very challenging for law

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
enforcement across the globe covert 19

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,079
has brought about many sharp disruptions

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,120
to our operational landscape as it swept

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
across our societies

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
cyber crime of course is no exception

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,239
our 2020 cyber crime analysis report had

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,360
evidenced how global criminal trends

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
further accelerated

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,800
attacks

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
are tailored

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
they are focused

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,840
aiming for maximum impact and maximum

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,039
profit

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
we have seen how ransomware was used

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,479
over the course of the pandemic against

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
governments and health institutions as

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,840
part of a highly lucrative business

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
model business email compromise is

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,119
another example that has heavily

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,320
impacted our societies with total

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
identified losses going beyond 13

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
billion us dollar according to some

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,280
sources and resulting in fraudulent

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,320
transfers across

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,240
140 countries

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
the threat is constant

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
far reaching and by definition

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
borderless

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
no part of the world stands above the

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,159
risks of cyber crime

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
yet some are particularly more

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
vulnerable than others

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
our 2021 interpol cyber threat

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
assessment for the african region for

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,560
instance

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
saw unique challenges across the

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,399
continent with the critical absence of

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
cyber resilience as well as mitigation

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,360
and preventive measures

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
while digitalization progresses

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
at full speed

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
how can we

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,400
as law enforcement bring cyber criminals

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
to justice when it is so easy for them

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,239
to channel their attack vectors across

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,959
multiple jurisdictions

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,920
and what insights can we provide to help

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
all of us be more prepared

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,920
fundamentally our adversary operates

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
across borders without restrictions

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
those tasked with combating the threat

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
police governments and private sector

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
must embrace the same global approach

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
this is our vision and it is underpinned

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
by three key concepts

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
trust

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
perspective

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
and common rules

66
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,640
commencing with trust

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,959
trust in tools

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
trust in channels we are using

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
and of course trust among partners the

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
very foundation on which cooperation is

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
built

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
an effective global response to

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,560
cybercrime means that all police all

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,200
over the world can gain access to the

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
intelligence and evidence they need to

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
detect and investigate crime

77
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,360
and we know investigation into cyber

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,319
crime can take investigators to all

79
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,440
corners of the globe in following the

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,599
chain of evidence

81
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,720
obviously this data cannot be disclosed

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,599
without absolute confidence it is going

83
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,480
in the right hands to the right people

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
this can be difficult for smaller police

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
forces around the world

86
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
this is why interpol is pursuing

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,480
initiatives to be the trusted partner to

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,239
connect police and the private sector

89
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
through our whois initiative to

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
facilitate law enforcement access to

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,879
domain name registration information

92
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
from the whois database

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
and through further work on assisting

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
police around the world to build trusted

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
digital identities

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,759
we also need to have the trust and

97
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,960
confidence to work closely with experts

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
in the private sector

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
this is the basis of interpol's gateway

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,199
initiative

101
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
which works with 13 global partners to

102
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,759
exchange

103
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
analyze and share threat data with our

104
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
membership

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
we must work at the global level

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
the threat is not only transnational it

107
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
is also cross-regional

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
and when this collaboration takes place

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
we are able to bring criminals to

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,240
justice

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,199
take interpol's recent operation cyclone

112
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,320
conducted at the end of last year

113
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
30 months of transcontinental

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
investigation into attacks against

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,759
companies in the republic of korea

116
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
and academic institutions in the united

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,039
states

118
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,680
led to the arrest of six members of a

119
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
well-known ransomware family in the

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
ukraine

121
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
private sector partners provided

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
information and dark web data analysis

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,919
throughout the operation

124
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
we want to replicate these results

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
across continents

126
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
this is why interpol is structuring its

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,840
operations around regional task forces

128
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
such as our very successful asean cyber

129
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,680
crime operational desk in our global

130
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
complex for innovation in singapore

131
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,280
with the support of the foreign office

132
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,919
of the united kingdom interpol has been

133
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,960
building

134
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
on this model to establish the africa

135
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,639
cyber crime operation desk

136
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,039
it is with that same support that

137
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,600
interpol's operation falcon 2

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
recently led to the arrest of 11 alleged

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
members of a prolific cyber crime

140
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,479
network in nigeria

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
going forward

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
global security will call for more such

143
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,319
activities

144
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
and we can get there by increasing our

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
data and information flows

146
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,800
and widening participation of the global

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
law enforcement community

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
this takes us to the second pillar

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
perspective

150
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,800
today's discussion rightly focus on the

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,360
challenges we will be facing into the

152
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,400
future

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
but we need to be mindful that there is

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,360
a large proportion of a global

155
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
population who will not have access to

156
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,440
that future just yet

157
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
as a result

158
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,639
while those at the cutting edge of

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
technology will embrace new technologies

160
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
and discard old ones

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,319
many communities and their law

162
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,759
enforcement organizations will not have

163
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,919
this opportunity

164
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,160
we need to remember that it

165
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
infrastructure needs regular ongoing

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,400
protection in terms of software updates

167
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
patches and other maintenance to keep it

168
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,560
protected from cyber threats

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,280
as we move forward there will

170
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
be a greater number of users relying on

171
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
servers web browsers and application

172
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
that no longer receive support from

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,080
technology providers

174
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
cyber criminals will take advantage of

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
this global gap

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,400
expanding their reach and their networks

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,319
this is an ongoing challenge for all of

178
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,120
us wanting to ensure global cyber

179
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,240
security making sure we are mindful of

180
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,520
best security practices when we offer

181
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
technical

182
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,599
assistance however even the most

183
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
effective operational capabilities will

184
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
be limited if we do not focus on the

185
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
third pillar the need for common rules

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,240
interpol brings together our 195 member

187
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
countries each with their own rules and

188
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,599
legislation against cyber crime or any

189
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,280
other type of crime

190
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,160
under a single common framework for the

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
processing of data

192
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
these clear robust and collective rules

193
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
offer a common ground that ensures the

194
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,080
efficiency and quality of international

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
cooperation between criminal police

196
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
authorities through our interpol

197
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,719
channels

198
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
however this is only one part of the

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
criminal investigative and judiciary

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
process

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,480
law investment can only act if there is

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,920
appropriate legislation and here again

203
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,120
the situation varies vastly from country

204
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
to country

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
the pace at which the cyber criminal

206
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
landscape is evolving can make it even

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
more difficult for legislation to keep

208
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,200
up

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
the resulting legislative gaps

210
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,600
pose challenges for law enforcement

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
agencies and prosecutors

212
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
specifically for cross-border

213
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
enforcement

214
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
this is a complex situation

215
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
and it is compounded by the lack of

216
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
global treaty law or legislation

217
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,040
to address cyber crime that we face

218
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,240
today

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
however we take note of the launch by

220
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
the united nations general assembly of

221
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
discussions over an international

222
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,160
convention

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
that could address some of the gaps that

224
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
exist today

225
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
we feel it is essential to have strong

226
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,519
law enforcement cooperation provisions

227
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
as part of the framework to translate

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,760
our collective will against global crime

229
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,880
into tangible results

230
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,640
this is interpol's research

231
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
ladies and gentlemen cyber criminals and

232
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
law enforcement are not fighting on

233
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
equal terms that is much clearer

234
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,800
just as the crime is borderless so we

235
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
must be prepared and so must be our

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
response

237
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
this is where the cooperation framework

238
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
made available by interpol fits in the

239
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,120
global security architecture

240
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
maintaining secured communication

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
channels and cooperative networks

242
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,360
offering a central repository for

243
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
criminal data from 195 member countries

244
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
and partners

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
acting as gateway between law

246
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
enforcement and the private sector

247
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
and serving as a deconfliction hub for

248
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,560
ongoing law enforcement investigations

249
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
and operations

250
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
this must be our shared objective

251
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
public and private sector alike

252
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,440
working across our respective boundaries

253
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
to push the exchange of actionable

254
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,560
information on cyber crime so that

255
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
threats are identified as soon as

256
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,880
possible

257
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
awareness is raised about them before

258
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,519
they spread globally

259
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,720
and mitigating actions is taken

260
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
i look forward to discussing with you

261
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,160
how we can achieve those objectives

262
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,600
together thank you very much
