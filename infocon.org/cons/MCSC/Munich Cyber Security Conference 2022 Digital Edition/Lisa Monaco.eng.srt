thank you very much uh thank you very

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,000
much for having me here at munich

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,759
and greetings from london

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,000
uh we're joined by the deputy attorney

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,920
general of the united states lisa monaco

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,440
thank you very much for joining us here

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,240
today

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,119
lisa we spoke at this event last year

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,039
when you talked about the ransomware

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
threat and the review you were launching

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,240
uh sadly we're only virtual but at least

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
we have the chance to catch up again i

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,159
was wondering if we could start by you

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
giving us an update really on

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
on that review and on the year we've

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
seen which has been a pretty busy one in

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
terms of the doj activity against uh

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,000
some of the cyber threats we see out

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,040
there

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
well thank you so much gordon and uh

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
it's great to be back with you thank you

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,760
all for having me here today i'm honored

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
to be part of this conference again this

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,640
year

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,399
you know for eight years now this

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,800
conference has provided a forum for

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,359
policy policymakers and experts alike to

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
gather from around the world to look to

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
the future of our collective global

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
cyber security and the munich cyber

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
security conference has always focused

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
on how to out innovate a constantly

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
evolving cyber threat and this year as

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,479
conventional weapons and cyber threats

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,400
stare down ukraine

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040
we are reminded that cyber security is

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
global security and we can't afford to

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,479
consider one without the other

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
now last year at this conference as you

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
mentioned gordon i warned of a pivot

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
point in the cyber threat a blended

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
threat of nation states and criminal

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,159
gangs

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
forming alliances of convenience and

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
working together to exploit our own

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,119
infrastructure against us

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
unfortunately as you mentioned we

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
continue to confront cyber criminals who

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
enjoy safe haven in authoritarian

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,560
countries and who wreak havoc in both

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
the digital and physical worlds in fact

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,159
just this morning the fbi along with our

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
partners at sisa and the nsa issued a

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
fresh warning that russian

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
state-sponsored cyber actors continue to

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,720
regularly target u.s defense contractors

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,440
now this is a challenge that no country

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,879
can tackle alone

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
and today i'll outline new steps the

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
department of justice is taking to

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
combat this unprecedented threat

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
following the comprehensive cyber review

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
that you mentioned gordon that i

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
launched last year

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
that review was led by my principal

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,239
deputy john carlin

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,400
we are now building on the department's

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
history of success across multiple

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,200
administrations and we're adapting old

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,080
tools to use in new ways while also

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,319
designing novel techniques to use in our

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,640
major cyber investigations

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,519
in the last year for the first time ever

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,680
we used a traditional search warrant to

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
execute code and erase digital backdoors

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
making hundreds of victim computers safe

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
and in an unprecedented cooperative

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
effort the fbi and international

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,319
partners including canada france germany

80
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
the netherlands the united kingdom

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,280
lithuania sweden and ukraine

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
all worked together and dismantled the

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
immotet botnet and released its grip on

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
victim computers

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
we also took down the world's largest

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
illegal marketplace on the dark net and

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,599
arrested at least

88
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,840
150 dark net traffickers thanks to the

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
joint criminal opioid and darknet

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
enforce enforcement team and thanks to

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
our europol and euro just partners

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
we must keep pace with the threat actors

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,599
who exploit innovations as fast as the

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
marketplace produces them

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,920
case in point the explosion of

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
ransomware and the abuse of

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,760
cryptocurrency

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,319
today the fbi is investigating more than

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
100 different ransomware variants

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
and prosecutors and law enforcement are

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
targeting dozens of ransomware groups

102
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
estimated to have caused billions of

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,720
dollars in damage to victims

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
so last year we launched the ransomware

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,200
and digital extortion task force to

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,319
develop new ways to attack the ecosystem

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
that allows ransomware to flourish

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,680
and because arrests are simply not

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
enough

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,880
we seized back from criminally

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
controlled wallets 2.3 million dollars

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
of the ransom paid after the colonial

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,199
pipeline attack and in the wake of the

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
attack on caseya the fbi obtained

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
decryptor keys so victims could unlock

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
ransomed systems

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
we coupled these innovations with

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,600
arrests and with criminal charges

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
and in november together with several of

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
our international partners we disrupted

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,800
the our evil ransomware group with five

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
arrests and the seizure of 6.1 million

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,960
dollars in alleged ransom payments

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
ransomware and digital extortion like

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,040
many other crimes fueled by

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
cryptocurrency only work if the bad guys

127
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,600
get paid

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,960
which means we have to bust their

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
business model

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
last week i announced the largest ever

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,759
financial seizure in the justice

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,280
department's history

133
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,160
the seizure of over 3.6 billion dollars

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
in stolen bitcoin and the money

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
laundering and conspiracy charges along

136
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
with it demonstrates that even in

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
cyberspace the department of justice is

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
able to use a tried and true

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
investigative technique

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
following the money

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,280
it's what led us to al capone in the 30s

142
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
it helped us destroy la cosa nostra in

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,400
the 60s

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
and it took down terrorist financing

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
networks in the early 2000s

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
the currency might be virtual but the

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
message to companies is concrete

148
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,320
if you report to us we can follow the

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
money and not only help you but

150
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,240
hopefully prevent the next victim

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
now these success stories are just the

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
beginning of what the department can do

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
that's why the fbi is forming a

154
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
specialized team dedicated to

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
cryptocurrency

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
the virtual asset exploitation unit this

157
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,160
fbi unit will combine cryptocurrency

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
experts into one nerve center that can

159
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,360
provide equipment blockchain analysis

160
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
virtual asset seizure and training to

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
the rest of the fbi

162
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,400
this unit will join the work of the

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
national cryptocurrency enforcement team

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
which i announced last fall

165
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,919
this team combines prosecutors with

166
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
expertise in money laundering computer

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,759
crimes forfeiture and regulatory policy

168
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
to go after those who abuse

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
cryptocurrency to commit crime

170
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
today that team is staffed with a dozen

171
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,759
prosecutors several of whom were

172
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
integral to last week's record-breaking

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
seizure and today

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
it gains its first director on young

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,880
choi a seasoned computer crimes

176
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
prosecutor and a leader in the field

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
what this last year tells us is that the

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,120
cyber threats of today demand that we

179
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
stay nimble and creative to counter the

180
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,960
threats of tomorrow

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,919
now as we evolve to meet this threat we

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,960
cannot and do not want to fight this

183
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,479
threat alone

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
now this audience knows better than

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
anybody that cyber threats do not

186
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
respect borders

187
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:26,880
and it's

188
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,199
just like the alliances we formed to

189
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
fight the battles of the past our

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,520
efforts are so much more powerful when

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
combined with those of our international

192
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
partners

193
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
evolving to match the cyber threat does

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,080
not only mean new tools and teams within

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,319
the department of justice

196
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
it means finding innovative ways to work

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,599
with our international partners

198
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,080
now it's the rare cyber investigation

199
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,759
that doesn't have an international

200
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,039
dimension

201
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,440
that is why prosecutors handling

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
significant cyber investigations will

203
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,160
now be required to consult with the

204
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
department's international and cyber

205
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
crime specialists to identify

206
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
international actions that might be able

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
to help stop a threat

208
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
international cooperation will not be an

209
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
afterthought

210
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,440
personifying this international focus we

211
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
are creating a new cyber operations

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
international liaison

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,639
that person's responsibility will be to

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,599
work with u.s prosecutors and european

215
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
partners to up the tempo of

216
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,159
international operations against

217
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,519
top-tier cyber actors we will embed this

218
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
capability in europe to ensure more

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,120
connectivity between our law enforcement

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
groups

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
we are also launching an international

222
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
virtual currency initiative to combat

223
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,279
the abuse of virtual currency

224
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,440
now this initiative will allow for more

225
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
joint international law enforcement

226
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,640
operations

227
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
more eyes from multiple law enforcement

228
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,920
agencies around the world to track money

229
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,519
through the blockchain

230
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
it will also foster responsible

231
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
regulation and anti-money laundering

232
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
requirements to root out the abuse of

233
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
these technologies

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
we are issuing a clear warning to

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,680
criminals who use cryptocurrency to fuel

236
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
their schemes

237
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,839
we also call on all companies dealing

238
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
with cryptocurrency

239
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,399
we need you to root out cryptocurrency

240
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,519
abuses

241
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
to those who do not we will hold you

242
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,560
accountable where we can

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,519
now

244
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
one of the things the key things i

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
learned after september 11th when i was

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,880
at both at the fbi and as head of the

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,720
national security division

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,279
it's that success is not prosecuting

249
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,920
terrorists after an attack when families

250
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
are grieving and their loved ones have

251
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,959
been lost

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,120
it may be necessary to be sure but

253
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
success is preventing that attack in the

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
first place

255
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,760
we need to apply that same thinking to

256
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,000
our cyber investigations

257
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
so moving forward

258
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,320
prosecutors agents and analysts will now

259
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
assess at each stage of a cyber

260
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
investigation

261
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
whether to use disruptive actions

262
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
against cyber threats even if they might

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,040
otherwise tip the cyber criminals off

264
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,519
and jeopardize the potential for charges

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
and arrests

266
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
in other words before we bring charges

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
we will assess whether there are steps

268
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,240
we can take to prevent or reduce the

269
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
risk to victims steps like providing

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
decrypter keys or seizing

271
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,839
servers used to further cyber attacks

272
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,839
we should consider the use of all

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
available tools and when i say all tools

274
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,519
i mean disruptive capabilities sanctions

275
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,120
and export controls

276
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
i mean not just those at the disposal of

277
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
our government but also those of our

278
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,200
international and private sector

279
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,240
partners

280
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
i mean earlier coordination so that our

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,399
partners can position themselves to take

282
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,120
their own actions against these threats

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,839
and i mean deploying forward justice

284
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
department personnel to work directly

285
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
with our partners such as at u.s cyber

286
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
command and elsewhere to achieve unity

287
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
of purpose and unity of action

288
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
now let me be clear

289
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
charging and apprehending cyber

290
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
criminals will still be a priority in

291
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,240
cyber crime cases just as it is in all

292
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,519
of our cases

293
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,160
arrests convictions and incarceration

294
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
provide a serious and personal deterrent

295
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
to criminals and they are the unique

296
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
responsibility of the department of

297
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,640
justice

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,120
but combining these with other tools

299
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
you've heard me describe today makes us

300
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,320
nimbler in disrupting the cyber threat

301
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
and this is especially true when threat

302
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
actors seek safe haven in rogue

303
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
countries or work on behalf of a foreign

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
government

305
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
now as a former prosecutor i can tell

306
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,800
you that this approach is not the first

307
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
instinct for trial lawyers who live in

308
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
the courtroom

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
but my message to the department is

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
clear we should be looking for success

311
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
both inside and outside the courtroom

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,079
and my message to cyber criminals is

313
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,440
equally clear

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
the long arm of the law can and now will

315
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,120
stretch much farther into cyberspace

316
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
than you think

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,560
if you continue to come for us

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,440
we will come for you

319
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
i am proud of all the work underway at

320
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
the department of justice to address the

321
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
growing range of cyber threats and i

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
appreciate the opportunity to share all

323
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,079
of this with you today and i'm looking

324
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,639
forward to answering some questions

325
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,480
thank you very much indeed lots of

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
questions uh that come out of those um

327
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
remarks um and we've got a few minutes

328
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
so i'll get on with it but uh ukraine i

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
suppose it's hard to avoid that as being

330
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
uh uppermost in people's minds very fast

331
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
moving we've heard reports today of the

332
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
us deputy ambassador i think being

333
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
expelled from russia i'm not sure if you

334
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,240
can comment on that and more broadly

335
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,880
how much concern you have about um

336
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
spillover of any conflict there in

337
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,079
cyberspace uh targeting the us and its

338
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
allies

339
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,519
well thanks uh gordon and you're quite

340
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
right things are moving very fast so um

341
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,880
let me start by giving some updates on

342
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
the situation in russia and in ukraine i

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,399
can confirm that russia has expelled

344
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,200
bart gorman the u.s deputy chief of

345
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,959
mission to russia

346
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,320
now dcm gorman is the second most senior

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
official at the u.s embassy in moscow

348
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
and a key member of the embassy's senior

349
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,360
leadership team

350
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,760
now russia's action against our embassy

351
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
personnel was unprovoked

352
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,959
and we consider this an escalatory step

353
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,199
the u.s government is still considering

354
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,680
our response and contrary to the

355
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,000
misinformation that's circulating gordon

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
i wanted to be very clear dcm gorman's

357
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,920
tour has not ended

358
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
he had a valid visa and he had been in

359
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,040
russia less than three years so we call

360
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
on russia to end its baseless expulsions

361
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
of u.s diplomats and staff and to work

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
productively to rebuild our mission

363
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,120
there

364
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
now more than ever it's critical that

365
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
our countries have the necessary

366
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,279
diplomatic personnel in place

367
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,920
to facilitate communications for our

368
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
between our two governments

369
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,320
now as to your question about spillover

370
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
i am absolutely concerned about that um

371
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
indeed it's not hypothetical as you know

372
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,720
gordon um the events flowing from the

373
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,839
not pecha attack uh several years ago

374
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,120
placed this

375
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,240
very squarely as not a hypothetical

376
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,959
concern um that attack as you know

377
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
started in ukraine and did indeed spill

378
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
over to the wider world including

379
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
causing billions of dollars in damage

380
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
both to u.s companies as well as to

381
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,519
international european uh countries so i

382
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
think cyber criminals need to know

383
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,079
that and cyber malicious actors need to

384
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,920
know that attacks on critical

385
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
infrastructure are unacceptable and will

386
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
be met with response

387
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,120
and more broadly though gordon right now

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
as you mentioned given the the very high

389
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,920
tensions that we are experiencing

390
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
companies of any size and of all sizes

391
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,639
would be foolish

392
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,279
not to be preparing right now as we

393
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
speak

394
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,959
to increase their defenses to

395
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,279
do things like patching to

396
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
heighten their alert to be monitoring in

397
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,519
real time um their cyber security they

398
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,800
need to be as we say shields up um and

399
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,680
to be

400
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,839
really on the most heightened level of

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,399
alert that they can be and taking all

402
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,800
necessary precautions

403
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
you talked about a blended threat

404
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
between state and criminals we saw some

405
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,519
high profile arrests in russia of the

406
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,800
our evil

407
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,519
group i think last month i just wondered

408
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,800
how you interpreted those arrests i mean

409
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
do you take it as a sign that russia is

410
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,839
taking this issue seriously or do you

411
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,120
some people think it might have even

412
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
been a message that they can turn this

413
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,480
on and off again when they need to

414
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
well gordon i'll say this about those

415
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
arrests um

416
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
in the complex geopolitical environment

417
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
that we're in and that we've just spent

418
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
a few minutes talking about i think we

419
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,720
need to consider the timing of those

420
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,839
actions

421
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,320
but look we welcome the arrests but make

422
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
no mistake whatever the signal that may

423
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
have been intended by russia with those

424
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,199
arrests the signal from here remains

425
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,880
clear and that's that we are not going

426
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
to stop our efforts we are going to go

427
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
after hackers we are going to go after

428
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,920
cyber criminals go after state-sponsored

429
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
malicious actors go after ransomware

430
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
perpetrators and hold them to account um

431
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
perhaps staying with a theme here of uh

432
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,120
russia uh solarwinds was a particularly

433
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,279
large espionage campaign uh which hit

434
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,120
the united states about a year ago i

435
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
think it was reported and the department

436
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
of justice was one of those hit by by it

437
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,400
i mean what did the department uh learn

438
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,880
from that experience

439
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
so um gordon as you know the the cyber

440
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,280
review that i reference in my remarks

441
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
and that you talked about at the

442
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,679
beginning

443
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
of this part of the program

444
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
that review

445
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,199
had as one point of focus our

446
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
cyber defenses our own

447
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
department of justice cyber security

448
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,480
and quite rightly we need to double down

449
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,360
on that given that we were indeed one of

450
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,919
the victims of solar winds look our

451
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,720
approach on this is what the

452
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
review revealed is that we need to take

453
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
what i call a c-suite approach and

454
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,039
frankly we need to practice what we

455
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,919
preach

456
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,440
to the wider world into our private

457
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,799
sector partners

458
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,520
and as the department of justice co the

459
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
chief operating officer

460
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
i take that responsibility exceptionally

461
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
seriously it's why i have a regular

462
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,320
cadence of engagement with our cio with

463
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
our information security office and i'm

464
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
tracking on a week to week basis the

465
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,679
progress we are making on increasing our

466
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,120
defenses

467
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
so what does it mean to practice what we

468
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,960
preach when i came back into government

469
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
and came into this position

470
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,960
i uh saw that we didn't have a playbook

471
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
for instance um to

472
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
respond to various cyber incidents you

473
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,679
know it's the kind of thing that we tell

474
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
ceos and cos you have to bring this

475
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
focus on cyber security make it a

476
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,480
c-suite issue make it a board level

477
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,440
issue and so i've taken that on board

478
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,760
here as well so we developed

479
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,200
a playbook we

480
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,960
have designed it we're going to be

481
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
practicing it testing it revising it

482
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
training it

483
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,520
things like who's a quarterback in the

484
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
event of a of a cyber incident how is

485
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,520
that response coordinated how is

486
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
information shared what are the

487
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,880
contingencies

488
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
as we as we deploy it so we're

489
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
developing we're testing we're training

490
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
it

491
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,160
and we've got to be taking on exactly

492
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
the same focus that we

493
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,760
ask others to do and make it a c-suite

494
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,200
level issue the other thing of course

495
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,679
gordon that we're doing the president

496
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
issued an executive order

497
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
requiring all federal departments and

498
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,120
agencies to up their game when it comes

499
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
to attacks like solarwinds so we are

500
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,880
also deploying zero test um zero trust

501
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,039
rather architecture multi-factor

502
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,559
authentication you name it the whole

503
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,400
suite of issues laid out in that

504
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,880
executive order

505
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,280
two of the themes from um your remarks

506
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
were uh disruption and the kind of

507
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,520
international um partnerships and you

508
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,880
talked about the international virtual

509
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,559
currency initiative could you give us a

510
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
bit more sense of of how that's going to

511
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
work i mean how do these partnerships

512
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,160
work when it comes to this disruptive

513
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
activity

514
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,679
so look i think what we need to be doing

515
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,960
and the idea behind this initiative is

516
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,679
um focusing our collective efforts on

517
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,760
the abuse of uh cryptocurrencies so um

518
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,480
getting our kind of a unified view and

519
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,600
unified effort at things like anti-money

520
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
laundering um

521
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
requirements things like have been

522
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
deployed in the financial action task

523
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
force or fatif that is now familiar

524
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
amongst many many governments so

525
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,799
combining our efforts having a as i said

526
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
in my remarks multiple eyes from law

527
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,240
enforcement on these issues um and

528
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
driving responsible regulatory policies

529
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,520
uh anti-money laundering requirements

530
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
know your customer requirements

531
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
and what we have seen in other contexts

532
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
like in fadith

533
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,919
where we bring the international

534
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
community together

535
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,400
and isolate bad actors who are not uh

536
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
sharing those best practices we can

537
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,280
we can drive better practices and it's

538
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
clear that the us has been pretty

539
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
forward leaning in terms of actually you

540
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,080
know going after the money as you talked

541
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
about i mean would you have you seen

542
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
other countries join you and do it in

543
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,799
being that proactive and disruptive and

544
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
would you like to see more from other

545
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
allies

546
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,559
uh absolutely both we have we have seen

547
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
it and we have benefited from

548
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,720
international cooperation on a number of

549
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,200
the cases that i i mentioned in my

550
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
remarks we can't do this alone uh so in

551
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,679
virtually every case that i mentioned

552
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,520
and every success i mentioned

553
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,000
at the crux of it was cooperation and

554
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
joint efforts by our international

555
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,799
counterparts but by using something like

556
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,480
the international virtual currency

557
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
initiative we can also help build

558
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
capacity where it doesn't currently

559
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,520
exist

560
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,320
share

561
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
some of the lessons that we've learned

562
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,240
build capacity amongst our partners so

563
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,159
we can do more of the kinds of things

564
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
that i mentioned and you think there's a

565
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
sense now from from the criminal groups

566
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
that cryptocurrency isn't as safe as it

567
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,520
used to be

568
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,640
well uh given the uh what we did last

569
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,720
week with the largest ever financial

570
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,520
seizure in the department's uh history i

571
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
think we are sending the clear message

572
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
that uh cryptocurrency and virtual

573
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
currencies uh should not be considered a

574
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
safe haven

575
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,280
and finally you you talked about this

576
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
shift towards um

577
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,520
uh disruption as well as prosecution

578
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
i mean that is a cultural change isn't

579
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,080
it in doj i mean it's a cultural change

580
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
i suppose you've got to communicate but

581
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
also perhaps in terms of the people you

582
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
recruit and the kind of talent you're

583
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
after and the way you approach it

584
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
so it is a cultural change in some

585
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,159
respects but as i mentioned we have done

586
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,440
that shift we've done that

587
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,120
transformation on the national security

588
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,919
side on the terrorism side um uh

589
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,440
recognizing that the first uh

590
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
approach needs to be one of preventing

591
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
the next attack it's a lesson obviously

592
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
we learned quite painfully

593
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,799
in

594
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
from 9 11. so i think while it is a

595
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
shift it's one we know how to do and can

596
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,120
employ it and when it comes to personnel

597
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,679
is another area that we focused on in

598
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
our cyber review and

599
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,120
have already

600
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,280
taken steps to address we launched a

601
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,640
cyber fellows program to recruit

602
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
and incentivize the next kind of

603
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
generation we know

604
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,919
that

605
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,320
cyber savvy

606
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
young people and young professionals

607
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
have lots of choices but we also in my

608
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
humble opinion have the best mission in

609
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,760
the world

610
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
here at the department of justice so we

611
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,840
are taking a lot of steps and are very

612
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,799
very focused on making sure we are

613
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,520
bringing on board that next generation

614
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,559
of

615
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,120
intelligence analysts prosecutors uh

616
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,840
attorneys uh investigators who can

617
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
really uh take the fight uh to where it

618
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
is moving

619
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
well i'm afraid that's all we've got

620
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,960
time for uh lisa monaco deputy attorney

621
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
general thank you very much uh for

622
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
joining us hopefully maybe next year we

623
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
can get another update perhaps even in

624
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
person but um for this year at least

625
