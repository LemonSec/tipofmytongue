1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
thank you dear chair wintergerst

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
dear mrs cesterli

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
ladies and gentlemen across the world

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
it's a real pleasure and an honor to be

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
here today for this

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
special edition

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,800
of the munich cyber security conference

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,840
and

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
when i say special it's special not only

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
because it's taking place due to a

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
format imposed by the current

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,238
circumstances but also because we are in

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,680
the midst of a major geopolitical

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,840
security crisis

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,640
that urges us to rethink how to equip

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
our societies and systems

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680
to fend off the attacks that may still

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,640
come

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
with devastating consequences

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,239
look around us

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,280
at our direct eastern external border in

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,559
belarus

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
we see an authoritarian regime using

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,359
human lives to put pressure on our

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,800
member states

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,959
and plant the seeds of division in our

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,720
societies also using information

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
manipulation to advance its agenda

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
attacking the west attacking the

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
european union our values our model of

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
society everything we stand for as

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,640
europeans

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
and most recently

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
another neighbor of ours ukraine

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
has been hit by a wave of cyber attacks

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,119
targeting its ministries and banks

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,680
aiming at destabilizing the country with

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,079
the risk of further escalating the

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,960
already very tense situation

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,600
these two events

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
are not isolated situations

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,159
every day

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
we hear of a new cyber attack or

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,640
attempted one

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
on our soil

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
in our neighborhood

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
in our society

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
this summer

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
it was the irish health system that was

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,960
paralyzed by cyber attack

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
then a supermarket chain in sweden

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
even the city hall of my hometown

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,800
thessaloniki in greece

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
last month

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
oil suppliers in belgium the netherlands

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,680
and germany were targeted

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,959
and last week

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,760
a major telecommunications operator in

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,399
portugal

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
we now know

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,200
that our neighbors and partners

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
are also

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
under attack and this is not innocent

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,440
this is not business as usual

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
just look at these attacks

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
look at how

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,480
pervasively they are evolving to reach

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,879
the heart of our society and of our

69
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
democracies

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
they no longer just have

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
economic rationale

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
these attacks

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,400
target even more and more

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
sectors and entities that are critical

75
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,000
to the functioning of our economy and of

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,319
our society

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,120
and

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
when successful

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
behind these administrations soil

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,200
suppliers and hospitals

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
it is the lives of our citizens

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,400
that are at stake

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,959
in such an intense

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
geopolitical context

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
we cannot fail to take this groundswell

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,480
of threats very seriously

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
we cannot allow these malicious actors

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
to penetrate our defenses

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
whether those of our institutions or

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
those of our citizens daily lives we

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
cannot allow them to operate in the

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
shadows to our economies

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,560
instill distrust in our institutions

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,680
and pit our fellow citizens against each

95
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
other

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,280
what we need to do

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,239
is to adapt our approach to our security

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
and our means to these protein threats

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,720
to move away from traditional

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
silo visions of security

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
to disseminate security considerations

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
across all our fields of actions and

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,879
policy

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
and to mobilize all the means we have at

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
our disposal across the policy board

106
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,240
and this is precisely what we did

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
and how we succeeded in responding to

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,759
the crisis in belarus

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
and this is exactly what we stand for to

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
do with ukraine

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,759
should the situation escalate further

112
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,800
i think

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
a key here is to mobilize the full

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
potential of cyber security

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,280
we need to take cyber

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,120
out of its tech

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
silo

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,800
and put it at the core of our security

119
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
is not an issue of industry

120
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,039
it's an issue of society

121
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,280
because in the world we live in

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
before an unfriendly tank crosses a

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
border

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
or a fight jet violates an airspace

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,039
it is networks that will have been first

126
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,440
tested and attacked

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
and at the same time there will have

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
been attempts

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,479
through internet

130
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
to convince citizens through various

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
media

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,039
that

133
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
they are not safe

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
and this is what they are doing against

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
the european union today and this is why

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
the european union stands ready to

137
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,720
respond

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
we are now

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
tapping into the immense potential of

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
cyber security expertise knowledge and

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
information wealth across our 27 member

142
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,199
states

143
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,440
to build together a capacity to prepare

144
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,560
deter

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,520
and respond to cyber and hybrid threats

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,039
we will be

147
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,639
activating

148
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
three strands of action

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,199
first

150
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,240
the legal one the regulatory one

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
we have always been at the forefront of

152
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,039
providing a clear and advanced legal

153
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
framework to protect businesses and

154
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
citizens against such threats

155
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
and in phase of these news threats

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
we're taking this legal framework to the

157
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,560
next level to make it future proof

158
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
firstly by equipping member states with

159
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
measures to ensure a high level of

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,160
physical and digital security of our

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
critical entities and infrastructures

162
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
across a wide spectrum of sectors

163
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,919
from industry to public administration

164
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,759
this is our proposals for a revised

165
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,479
network information system directive

166
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,120
and for a directive on the resilience of

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
critical entities

168
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
then

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
by setting high standards for the cyber

170
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,400
resilience of our supply chains

171
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,599
enisa

172
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,560
the eu agency for cyber security

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
assessed that attacks on the supply

174
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,639
chain have multiplied by four

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,840
last year

176
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
compared to 2020

177
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,919
and this is why

178
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
president fonder lion has announced

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
the forthcoming proposal of a cyber

180
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
resilience act

181
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
before the end of this year

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
this cyber resilience act will serve as

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
to enhance security of ict products

184
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
those products that are most often the

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
loophole through which malicious actors

186
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,000
rush to attack us

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
the second strand of action

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,759
is to continuously upgrade not only our

189
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,120
legal

190
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
arsenal but also our operational

191
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,759
capacities to be able to detect incoming

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
threats sufficiently in advance

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,039
but also when these occur

194
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
to be able to provide clear

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
and robust responses

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
this is why we are investing

197
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,639
substantially in cyber defense centers

198
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
with new equipment for early detection

199
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
thus enhancing our eu cyber shield

200
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
we are also taking bold steps to bring

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
together the eu cyber capacities across

202
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,479
eu bodies and agencies from the civilian

203
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,840
diplomatic

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
law enforcement and cyber security

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,440
communities through the upcoming joint

206
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
cyber unit

207
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,200
to make sure that they exchange timely

208
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,600
information and can coordinate responses

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
finally the third and vital aspect when

210
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,160
it comes to strengthening our

211
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
operational capacities

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
is ensuring that we have sufficient

213
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
people in europe

214
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,080
people with the skills to master cyber

215
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
security tools and to develop disruptive

216
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
breakthrough technologies for our cyber

217
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,080
security

218
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
today unfortunately europe is short of

219
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
the cyber security professionals we need

220
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,640
and this vice president responsible for

221
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,839
coordinating eu work both for the areas

222
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,120
of security and the areas of skills

223
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
i see the urgent need to boost the

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
number of specialists in cyber security

225
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
across our union

226
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
for this reason

227
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,560
i call on all of you to join forces

228
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,080
and make concrete pledges to train

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
professionals and cyber security skills

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,279
time is of the essence

231
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
the commission stands ready to support

232
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,080
your ambitions and commitments through

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,920
the pact for skills that we launched a

234
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,120
year ago

235
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
and i will

236
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,519
next year

237
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,360
come here to the munich security

238
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
conference with results this is a

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
complete promise a pledge that i take

240
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
the opportunity to deliver because this

241
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
is urgently needed

242
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
the emerging cyber threat landscape

243
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
is a global threat

244
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
no one is immune

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,560
and it challenges the basic principles

246
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
on which the multilateral order has been

247
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
built for these reasons

248
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,519
we need a common response and we need to

249
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,279
join forces with like-minded partners

250
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,519
across the world

251
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
we now need to bring this technical

252
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,040
cyber cooperation to the political level

253
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
and these global rules of the games

254
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,399
need at the same time operational

255
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,680
support

256
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,240
to our friends allies and neighbors so

257
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,959
that they can themselves build their own

258
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,560
resilience when facing threats

259
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
in short

260
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
we need to pull our political

261
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
economic and technological resources to

262
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,959
create a ring of resilience

263
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,240
together

264
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
both within the union and around the

265
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
union

266
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,680
let me finish

267
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,320
dear ladies and gentlemen participants

268
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,279
by saying that what is at stake in the

269
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,360
midst of the geopolitical crisis we're

270
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
going through

271
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,000
is not simply economic or territorial

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
gain

273
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,160
but at our principles our values

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
our model of society the foundations of

275
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
our democracy

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
and beyond words we need actions

277
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
to face and respond

278
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
to turn the tide

279
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
to quote the title of this year's munich

280
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
security report

281
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
yes clouds are drifting

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
fast that is true

283
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
but let's not forget that every one of

284
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,079
them

285
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,120
has a silver lining and we need to join

286
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
forces to address together these

287
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,839
challenges

288
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,240
thank you again
