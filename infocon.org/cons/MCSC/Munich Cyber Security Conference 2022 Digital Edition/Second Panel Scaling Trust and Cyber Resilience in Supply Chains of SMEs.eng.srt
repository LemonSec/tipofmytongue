also based in the us good morning to you

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,760
as well

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
we have started today by hearing several

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
perspectives

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,600
from

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
policy makers and from leaders of

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
security agencies we now like to move on

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,360
to

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
the perspective of companies where the

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,759
cyber threats

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,280
are also failed

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
and they lead to

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
slightly different perspectives and

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
slightly different issues just to give

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
you a perspective the last statistics i

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,520
read

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
were that in 2021 more than 500 000

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
companies have been successfully

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
uh attacked by cyber criminals globally

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,479
so this is a huge issue for companies

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
worldwide

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
and

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
this is not only an issue for your own

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,520
company it also becomes an issue when

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
you as a company have done your homework

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
when you are already pretty secure but

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,600
then your supply chain is being attacked

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
the companies you're being working with

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,038
the the partners you have and a cyber

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,239
criminal might face and might focus on a

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
weaker link than you yourself which

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
might lead to the physical shutdown of

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
your supply chain which is detrimental

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
or

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,720
in the newer scenarios it might also

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
lead to an attack on

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
for example software providers which

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
might lead to a situation where your

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,120
company is breached due to the fact that

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
one of your suppliers has been breached

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,959
so

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
uh going around the companies what's

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
your perspective on this topic what is

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,640
the situation of your supply chain

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,920
actually let's maybe start with you

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
no i'm thinking uh thank you i think i'm

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
on thank you um

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
i think first of all i think the the

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
last couple of months uh showed that

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
supply chain is a quite

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
important topic on a global scale um i

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,959
think our

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
advantages in our view on on i.t

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
security always have been quite

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
uh supply chain focused as we always try

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
to

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
leverage the latest technologies

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,080
not do everything on our own

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,519
which means that we always had to

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
collaborate collaborate both on the

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
hardware side and also on the software

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
side

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
which means for us uh supply chain was

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,440
always a very key topic both

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
on on our supplier side on the hardware

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
so we worked very closely together for

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
example with intel on their latest

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,159
roadmaps

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
we work together with

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,519
with software suppliers and we integrate

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
that and at the end of course you need

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
a certain trust level um we try to have

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
certain certifications also on the

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,239
supply chain not only on the product

99
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,280
itself

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
and make the utmost possible to have a

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
trustworthy

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
product itself but of course supply

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
chain is a very uh very key topic we

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,799
always assess our suppliers on the

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,720
security side

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
and i know trustworthy is a nice word to

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,959
say but i think it's still

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,239
you need some heart facts as well and

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,799
you have to look uh very carefully also

110
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
in their architecture and very often we

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
we manage to uh

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,920
to work

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
on potential security targets because we

114
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,760
know also the security

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
issues on our supply chain site as well

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
and that's helps a lot so the better

117
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,120
understanding you have on the supply

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
chain side the better you can react on

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
your product offering

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,479
to make sure that your product offering

121
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
as such at the end is on a secure secure

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
way

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
standardization is a very important

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
topic for us we always try to work on

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
standards

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
because that helps of course also on

127
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
interability

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,199
and at the end for us of course id

129
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
security comes by design so we have a

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
holistic view i would say on the

131
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,440
on the total portfolio at the end have

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
on our base and that will also continue

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
of course if we enter cloud solutions

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
cloud infrastructure

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,639
where we have

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
open source solutions basically where we

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
have a full control of our

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,639
added value on the supply chain site and

139
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,880
also carefully analyze what's what's

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,919
underneath

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
so i.t security on the supply chain side

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
is as important as we see on the global

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,400
supply chains we have seen with the

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,720
shortages as well over the last quarters

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
to corona

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
george coming to apple what's your

147
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
perspective what's going on

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,919
so um apple clearly is not an island and

149
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,759
we have a very extensive network of

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,520
suppliers who actually uh you know are

151
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
part of our story

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
um so over the last few years we have

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
been noticing uh what is happening in

154
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
the industry and clearly as you said

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
before like we're seeing these attacks

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,280
especially

157
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840
hitting a very wide set of companies

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
that are critical of the supply chain

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
across the whole board

160
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
so when we analyze our supply line

161
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
we see a very big spectrum of different

162
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,360
suppliers that we have we have anything

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
from the people who bring the produce to

164
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,680
our cafeterias the software hardware

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,639
services we use for our everyday

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
product creation

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,479
content creation movies music and so on

168
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
all the way down to the suppliers who

169
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
are critical to our production lines

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
when we try to map on those suppliers

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
the different security capabilities we

172
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
have we also see a very wide spectrum we

173
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
see a set of companies who are

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
extremely the same sophisticated and

175
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,319
mature security programs but we also see

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
companies who simply security is

177
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,759
completely lacking

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
and if you kind of zoom out a little bit

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
on that spectrum

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
you kind of see us a line forming that

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
you know metaphorically speaking we call

182
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,280
it security poverty line where basically

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,639
the resources and the technical deficit

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,280
uh that a company has may not be enough

185
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
to actually create a security program

186
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
that is robust and we can actually uh

187
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,840
last

188
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,039
um and in general again in that spectrum

189
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,599
you find out that companies who are uh

190
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,880
who have the resources and have the

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
technical expertise the you know the big

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
fortune 500 companies seem to have a lot

193
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
more about us programs it contrasts in

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,759
the small and medium businesses who the

195
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,919
security spend and security expertise is

196
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
kind of lacking and again in general

197
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
there's actually

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
exceptions that are over

199
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
so the cliche comes over that says

200
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,960
basically if you're trying to fix the

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
security problem you're kind of trying

202
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
to boil the ocean

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,039
and we believe that basically one of the

204
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,840
uh

205
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,120
easy

206
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
success stories we can have is if we

207
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,199
focus on small and medium businesses if

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
focused to the companies who simply are

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
below that metaphorical security poverty

210
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
line and trying to make them more secure

211
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
thank you very much

212
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,479
um avid i'm very sure

213
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
despite the fact that a car for me still

214
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,960
is a physical thing cyber security plays

215
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
a great role in all this supply chain as

216
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
well what's going on

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
yeah you can be sure about that also

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,720
supply chain is very important because

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
we are not alone in the world we are

220
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
depending on our partners and our

221
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,160
suppliers and we only can manage to

222
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
produce cars if we can depend on that

223
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,639
network

224
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,199
that we that we need to do this uh

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
however during the last year we saw um

226
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
especially in our supply chain that

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,759
ransomware was a major threat that was

228
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
endangering

229
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
supplies

230
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,479
that's not only

231
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,400
true for our supervisor manufacturing

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
industry and more than that

233
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
and

234
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,840
i think it's

235
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
getting worse before better so

236
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
um

237
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,199
one of the one of the things that

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
needs to be understood in my eyes is

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
that security is a holistic thing so we

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
cannot be secure as an audi as a company

241
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
we can only be secure as a society so we

242
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,799
need to work together and meet an open

243
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
uh well sharing

244
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,120
um of things so what we saw and that was

245
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
very positive that ceos of the smaller

246
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
and

247
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
medium companies that we're working

248
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,640
together with have security very clearly

249
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
on their agenda so it is not a topic

250
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
about being not aware of uh about it

251
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,279
um but

252
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
still what we also saw was that the way

253
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
that they treated incidents yeah

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
some of the companies are very open and

255
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,760
are very

256
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,680
uh ready to share and that that was very

257
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
good experience during the last year and

258
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
uh helped understanding the kind of the

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
texts that were ongoing and we could

260
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
help each other out with advice and

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
procedures and whatever and on the other

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,160
hand there are still companies that are

263
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
very reluctant and being

264
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
open i don't know why um

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
as i said it's a society security cannot

266
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,270
be um

267
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,000
[Music]

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,399
managed alone and so so you need to work

269
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
together on this

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
and as i said very positive that they

271
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
have it on the agenda but they need to

272
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
have it more on the agenda still because

273
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
um we we were talking in the other panel

274
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
there was talk about thai sex titans

275
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
certification process that we have in

276
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
the automotive

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,600
and this really really helps to to

278
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
get them into our supply chain uh that

279
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
can prevent attacks but what we also saw

280
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
is that ty 6 may not be enough because

281
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
if you only have a a paper area and the

282
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
structure behind the paper

283
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
is not ready to to

284
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
get a grip on the attacks that are going

285
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
on it's for certain that's not enough so

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,959
um working together on a higher level uh

287
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
in sharing information in sharing

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
indicators of compromise for instance in

289
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,000
ongoing attacks that's going to help all

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
of us so

291
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,519
again the sharing culture is what makes

292
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,079
the difference

293
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,880
thank you very much

294
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
going over to phil

295
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,760
what does google think about all of this

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
yeah so in the context of the

297
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
software supply chain overall i mean

298
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
we've we've historically placed a

299
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
significant priority on the security of

300
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,240
our software supply chain as well as

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
the overall integrity of the hardware

302
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
supply chain and and you know we like a

303
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,800
lot of you know large technology

304
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
companies are continuing to invest in

305
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
the integrity of of that software and

306
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
and any external dependencies that we

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
have and i would say for us

308
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
a lot of the external dependencies are

309
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,839
mostly open source and and these are the

310
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,680
the elements that we've originated and

311
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
manage anyway

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
and at the heart of how we think about

313
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
software supply chain is is is a

314
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
concentration on how you not only

315
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
deal with software you've taken from say

316
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
an open source environment but how you

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
generate and build the the software in a

318
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
secure way internally and so you know

319
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
like a lot of companies we're very

320
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
focused on making sure there's

321
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
two-person control on changes uh a whole

322
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
drive for an intensive examination of

323
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
security through the build process and

324
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
then a hardened build process that

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
produces digitally signed software that

326
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,800
our infrastructure explicitly validates

327
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
before executing and the reason i

328
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
mentioned kind of our internal process

329
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
is we've actually taken this and turned

330
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
this into an open framework

331
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
an open standard that organizations can

332
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
use to assess themselves and their

333
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
supply chains and we we call this thing

334
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,880
salsa it's actually slsa it stands for

335
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
supply chain levels for software

336
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
artifacts and it's now an open an open

337
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,800
framework at slsa.dev

338
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
and again this is what we're using as

339
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
well to drive

340
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
that approach for

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,279
end-to-end secure software supply chain

342
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,880
management into a lot of the products

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
that we have that we that we share with

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
that we share with customers and i would

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,279
just kind of you know and you know end

346
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,200
this answering just also you know

347
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
building on what a number of the other

348
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,880
panelists said about the kind of the

349
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
partnership between organizations and

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
the partnership between the the public

351
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
and private sector and we're certainly

352
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
engaged with governments around the

353
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
world on looking at the software supply

354
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,279
chain risks and the wider ecosystem and

355
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,519
really figuring out ways we can take the

356
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
disparate sources of knowledge and

357
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,959
expertise in different companies and the

358
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,279
uh and the public sector understanding

359
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
the threat environment understanding the

360
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
best practices and and bring that

361
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,200
together but for example you know we we

362
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,279
with some of the other uh companies were

363
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
were founding members of the so-called

364
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
joint cyber defense collaborative the

365
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
jcdc organized by the us department of

366
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
homeland security and that's one of many

367
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
global efforts that are not only

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
coordinating on sharing threat

369
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,200
information but promulgating best

370
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
practices on how to manage the extended

371
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
risks in the software supply chain which

372
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
i think is a good pattern for what we

373
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
would expect going forward

374
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
thank you very much phil and um

375
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
i'd like to to stay with you for a

376
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,200
moment around this topic of

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
open source software i think

378
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
many participants uh uh have been

379
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
affected by the lobe 4j incident earlier

380
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
this year which was not so much about

381
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
someone uh

382
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
who tries to corrupt software with bad

383
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
intentions but where a an open source

384
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
component that was used millions of

385
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
times across the planet just due to the

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
fact that it was being maintained or is

387
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,680
being maintained by a small group of

388
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
volunteers uh had some

389
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,199
issues that that then led to the to the

390
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,680
long forget situation where a lot of

391
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,599
commercial packages became vulnerable

392
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,959
what ideas would you have to to kind of

393
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,120
across industries and across companies

394
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,519
try to deal with with this issue in a

395
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
better way because i think we have the

396
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,199
problem for a lot of

397
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,160
um open source components that are are

398
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,800
used multiple times yeah no i think

399
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,399
that's exactly right i think when i when

400
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
a lot of organizations look at their

401
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
software supply chain risk as i

402
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
mentioned a big part of that is the

403
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,760
is the consumption of and use of open

404
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
source software and for many

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,519
organizations the contribution back to

406
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,519
open source software and certainly you

407
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
know at google we've been a major

408
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,880
advocate for open source software and

409
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,519
the wider open source ecosystem and in

410
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,760
fact as i think many much of the

411
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,519
audience will know we we've originated

412
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
and made significant contributions to

413
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,160
key open source projects like kubernetes

414
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
tensorflow and and myriad of others and

415
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
so you know we we think the answer is

416
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
exactly as you're posing the question

417
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,720
when you think about open source it's

418
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,639
how do we collectively make sure we're

419
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
improving the security the management

420
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
and maintenance of open source software

421
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
rather than restricting issues because i

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,800
think open source provides tremendous

423
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,199
benefits and a large part of our global

424
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
digital ecosystem is built on the

425
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
benefits of open source but as you said

426
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
with things like log4j and some other

427
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,320
events before that managing the use um

428
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
maintenance update finding and resolving

429
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
security vulnerabilities in open source

430
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,720
is critical and this is again another

431
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,759
one of those

432
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
important community efforts so for

433
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,240
example in in 2020 along with a number

434
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
of other companies we co-founded a an

435
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,560
organization called the open source

436
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
security foundation

437
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,279
and this is dedicated to to help drive

438
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
improvements in open source security

439
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,000
we've for example we announced last year

440
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
a further commitment of a hundred

441
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,160
million dollars to help fund activities

442
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
in finding resolving critical security

443
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,759
issues in in open source software and

444
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,880
there's a whole array of things that

445
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
we're doing through that through

446
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
scorecards project to look at risks in

447
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
open source dependency analysis tools uh

448
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
and the recently announced alpha and

449
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
omega project which is really working

450
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
towards finding and resolving issues in

451
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
the most used projects and then

452
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,120
providing tools in the long tail of some

453
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,279
of the lesser used open source

454
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
open source packages that organizations

455
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,600
use and so like the final thing i'll say

456
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,399
is

457
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,199
in any organization that is using and

458
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,839
depends on open source software which as

459
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,000
i said i think is a lot of organization

460
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
should really kind of join the community

461
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,240
join the open source security foundation

462
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
and partner with everybody else on on

463
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,880
really driving improvements and tooling

464
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,279
and driving improvements in the most

465
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
critical open source software that all

466
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,680
of our society depends on we we have the

467
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
framework to enable that collaboration

468
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
and we we definitely encourage everybody

469
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,319
to sign up to help

470
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
thank you very much and indeed that's

471
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
that's uh an important approach to to

472
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
help across companies george i

473
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,439
understand uh you have some ideas around

474
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
that as well what what can be proposed

475
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
especially to smaller companies to to

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
get better cyber security in the supply

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,039
chain

478
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
so as you said um we have a clear focus

479
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
on the small and medium businesses how

480
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
we can actually improve security

481
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
we did a lot of analysis and one of the

482
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,400
things we found out is um for many of

483
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
those discussions that we have with our

484
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,919
partners uh we're asking them to do

485
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
security from zero to a hundred and just

486
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,039
to illustrate the point um think about

487
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,039
talking to your dentist and talk to them

488
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,440
about zero trust networking or think

489
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
about talking to uh like you know your

490
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,559
travel agent that say you need to do

491
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,200
advanced persistent threat hunting right

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
uh it's words that they are very

493
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,840
complicated it's a it is a you know the

494
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
world even the word cyber if you want to

495
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
put it into perspective it becomes very

496
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
unapproachable to many small and medium

497
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
businesses because i think like you know

498
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
spies and countries and so on

499
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
so one of the things we wanted to do is

500
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,679
we try we're trying to create the

501
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,760
experience of getting your feet wet in

502
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
security easy

503
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,960
so

504
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,240
we looked at all the things that could

505
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
be extremely impactful and we came up

506
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
with like five basic principles that we

507
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,360
believe that if small and medium

508
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
businesses start it's going to take them

509
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
into a path of getting you know

510
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
improving the robustness of the security

511
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,760
program the first one is training

512
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,240
and it sounds really simple but actually

513
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,280
a

514
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
basic training available to small and

515
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
medium businesses doesn't really exist

516
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
readily so we partner with the sub

517
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,640
readiness institute and we have

518
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
published the principles and also help

519
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,240
our suppliers go through a series of

520
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
training programs uh to just basically

521
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
understand security

522
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
after that we start looking at what

523
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
things could be more impactful

524
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,919
impactful and think of them as the first

525
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,640
five chapters of your security uh

526
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
adventure so the first one is to move

527
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
beyond passwords uh in this day and age

528
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
if you're using single factor off you're

529
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
gonna become a victim there's just no

530
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
way around it so if you can help our

531
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,919
suppliers move to uh multi-factor

532
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,559
authority to unvisible passwords we

533
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,080
think this is a very success would be a

534
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,679
very successful uh first step in

535
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,280
improving the security of our supply

536
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
chain

537
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
funnily enough about uh i think like i

538
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,760
think 33 percent of the uh suppliers we

539
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
interviewed they said they do not have

540
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
uh multifactor enabled but it was

541
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,559
scarier than that is

542
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,000
some of them actually did and they did

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
not know about it somebody had bought

544
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
the product that actually allows them to

545
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,600
have mfa but they haven't done it

546
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,960
so it was kind of like the general

547
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
awareness about mfa did not exist

548
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,720
the third pillar would be patching

549
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,080
we want companies to have a fairly

550
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
robust patching regime and that's not

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
just like the main product that they

552
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
have but the printers the routers and so

553
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,840
on

554
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
then we go to the more difficult things

555
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679
we want them to have logging enabled

556
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
which seems to be the most bizarre thing

557
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,039
where you buy a product and login

558
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
becomes like the five switches you have

559
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,799
to do in order to turn them on but if

560
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,320
you don't have logging enable the

561
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,919
companies will not be able to know if

562
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,280
they have been impacted how they have

563
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
been impacted in their clinic

564
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
and the fifth principle is all about um

565
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,679
incidence response you need to know the

566
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
first steps after something happens to

567
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,640
you how are you going to start

568
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
recovering your business where your

569
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,400
backups are who you're calling to come

570
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
and help you and try to restore yourself

571
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,360
to some set of normality so these five

572
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,400
basic principles is the five chapters uh

573
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,720
uh to help us get out of uh business

574
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
thank you george

575
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
be it the five principles for a small

576
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,159
company be it more elaborate measures in

577
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
a large company that's a significant

578
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,480
cost burden we're talking about

579
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
arvid um as a cso probably you often

580
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
have to justify yourself for the cost

581
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,039
how are you trying to deal with this

582
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,240
um

583
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
i'm in a happy situation because as i

584
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,120
said um our ceos have it on the agenda

585
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
however i see this is a problem for for

586
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
especially mid and small-sized companies

587
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
to argue for the money that you need to

588
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,880
invest in technology technology is the

589
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
thing that costs money however

590
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,799
technology is only a tool so it may not

591
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,799
be the right thing to invest into so

592
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,799
what i like to see

593
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,960
security investments well they're

594
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
they're considered a cost center i would

595
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,320
rather see them as a cost avoidance

596
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
center because i mean it's about keeping

597
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,480
risk from your business and um there are

598
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
figures around that that calculate how

599
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,080
much an uh cyber um incident costs a

600
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,880
smaller mid-size or a huge company

601
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
per day so if you

602
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,679
just take that you would have to um that

603
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,440
you would have to spend

604
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,280
as a result of a cyber incident and

605
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,559
invest one one day worth of um money

606
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,039
into your preparations uh into

607
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
technology into your people that may be

608
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,159
worth something so uh actually

609
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,520
preparedness for cyber attacks can save

610
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,000
business and can make the business more

611
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
valuable or uh save the value that the

612
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,039
business is expected to bring

613
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,400
i guess

614
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,039
if we're talking about investments um

615
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,320
um the

616
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,159
result that the security investment

617
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,840
directly brings in connection with the

618
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,559
business uh is not recognized that

619
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,320
there's reason for that because um

620
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,799
obviously the security experts like us

621
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,720
are not or i have not been able to

622
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
explain what the benefit of the

623
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
technology would be however it is more

624
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
important to also invest in the people

625
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,159
themselves because uh they need to react

626
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
to a cyber incident in the first place

627
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,799
by not clicking the link yes so

628
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,880
preparedness is something different is

629
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
something else

630
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
and that's not going to cost much money

631
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,360
so

632
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,679
the reason it may actually be that you

633
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,720
are more

634
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
successful if you

635
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,679
take the invest

636
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,400
only worth a day of of uh

637
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
of the cost of a cyber incident and uh

638
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
invest it uh

639
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
in a way that uh

640
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,559
that is uh valuable to your company

641
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,679
then just not to do anything about it so

642
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
to consider it as a cost avoidance

643
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,679
center helps to understand that there's

644
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
risk involved and to reduce the risk is

645
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
something that also the business leaders

646
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
do understand so it's the way that we

647
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,840
communicate the way that we explain

648
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,840
axel as the chairman of the european

649
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,679
cyber security organization you have a

650
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
broad perspective uh across what's

651
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,679
what's going on in cyber security in

652
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,320
europe what approaches are you seeing uh

653
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
to address this type of supply chain

654
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,639
problem

655
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
yeah well there are a couple of

656
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,120
of aspects um both from secondary side

657
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
but also from from exercise what we try

658
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,559
to achieve maybe let me start with the

659
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,080
second at first

660
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
and i think i would what had a very good

661
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,279
point where i'm

662
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
being the in the i.t security industry

663
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,799
for 20 years i'm a little bit frustrated

664
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,559
because we're still talking about costs

665
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
and risk avoidance

666
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,240
we never talk about business enablement

667
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,400
at the end because if we don't cover up

668
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
i.t security issues and cyber security

669
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,760
issues

670
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,640
i think we will block uh future business

671
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
models that are that are potential even

672
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
in the iot space etc nothing will work

673
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,400
without a decent

674
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
amount of i.t security i'm still

675
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,919
frustrated that's for us at least also

676
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,440
mixed picture

677
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
uh we'll see in the market that some

678
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,960
companies are really having a different

679
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,880
view on things really taking i.t

680
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,120
security seriously and having some sort

681
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,640
of long-term

682
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
understanding and roadmap building their

683
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,600
architecture

684
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
but still a lot of companies already

685
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
reactive mode on i.t security just

686
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,400
covering up

687
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,480
i would say the minimum requirements and

688
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,960
just taking up it as a risk management i

689
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,039
think we have to change

690
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
the educational level that's what we

691
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
also try to do with exo also consulting

692
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
the european commission on i.t security

693
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
on

694
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
digital sovereignty at the end what we

695
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
saw that of course a lot of european

696
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,320
manufacturers uh industry players

697
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,880
service providers are relying of course

698
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,039
on supply chain that comes both from us

699
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,880
both from asia and we cannot ignore that

700
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
and we have to collaborate so we

701
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
believe also from exo's point of view we

702
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
need partnerships to work in that

703
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
environment trusted partnerships we can

704
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
also certify

705
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,799
and i think that's a little bit the

706
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,279
challenge on the open source uh

707
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
situation as well we are working on open

708
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,720
source we believe open source is a very

709
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
good tool to solve those issues

710
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
but at the same time you have the

711
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,960
tension that you have also certain

712
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
trustworthiness in certifying products

713
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
so we do both we do open source

714
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,279
portfolio but we also do certification

715
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
with it which is of course limiting a

716
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,919
limit and the dynamic development

717
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,960
but

718
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
at the end we can provide a global

719
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,600
platform solution finances future it

720
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
will be also cloud offerings

721
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
uh that that will have a certain

722
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
certification that will be also

723
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,799
trustworthy to the market

724
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
and i think we need that partnerships on

725
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,919
the european level but also on the

726
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,840
global level but we need to have some

727
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,919
common standards in dropability

728
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,400
certification levels to have this

729
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
trustworthiness and that's i think what

730
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,400
has been shown in the in the last couple

731
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,919
of months you just mentioned the numbers

732
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,440
at the beginning

733
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,840
supply chain risks have been quadrupled

734
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
i think from 20 to 21 of course because

735
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,840
supply chains have been

736
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
obviously much more vulnerable probably

737
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,279
than they have been before and that goes

738
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,799
for the physical part but also for the

739
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,679
i.t security parts and i.t solution part

740
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,000
and i think that's something we have to

741
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,320
raise awareness at exo on the european

742
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,360
level

743
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,799
on a global level

744
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,159
as well

745
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,760
because we believe there are solutions

746
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,520
we can cope with it but we need to raise

747
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
the understanding in the

748
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,919
in the industrial world in the in the in

749
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,279
our customer

750
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,320
base and

751
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
we receive a mixed picture again some

752
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
companies are really having

753
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
addressed that issue working on it also

754
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,760
willing to spend money on i.t security

755
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,919
not just covering that as a cost issue

756
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,760
or we need finally we need to invest

757
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
some on i.t security but have a

758
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
long-term roadmap of integrating by

759
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,320
design i.t security

760
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
measures in their portfolio and i think

761
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,440
those

762
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
companies will be far by far better off

763
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,120
in the next couple of years so it's not

764
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,960
a risk factor it's really business

765
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,679
enablement at the end

766
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
and that awareness we have to raise uh

767
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,520
and that that

768
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,039
understanding also on the management

769
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,720
level still has to be uh more broadened

770
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,399
and that's from our point of view not

771
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,080
the case we have solutions there of

772
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,760
course and i think that it can be solved

773
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
also on a global level with partnerships

774
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,760
because we are relying on each other

775
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,679
uh but we have to work on it and we it's

776
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,679
some sort of long-term approach

777
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,360
with

778
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
certain milestones also on certification

779
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,799
because with all the dynamic we'll see

780
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,240
on the software development that's great

781
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
but that led also to the security

782
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
attacks we we saw in the last

783
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,360
in the last year so it's a balanced

784
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
picture and that's something we're

785
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
working on

786
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,679
thank you

787
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,640
um we already started to to move a

788
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,919
little bit into

789
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,159
uh how potential solutions look like and

790
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,760
what a potential focus uh could be

791
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
um and

792
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,559
i think it's great that we have an

793
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,320
audience with both uh company

794
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,559
representatives and policy makers around

795
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,679
us uh to to maybe take up these calls

796
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,200
for action

797
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,399
you already

798
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,960
mentioned the the human factor in your

799
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,840
last statement and we heard before from

800
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,320
uh from from jen easterly that culture

801
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,000
plays an important role when it comes to

802
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,440
cyber security

803
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,880
um

804
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,240
would you like to elaborate a little bit

805
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,080
more on that topic

806
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
yeah sure um the human factor i mean we

807
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
are humans and humans are prone to

808
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
making the failure and that's exactly

809
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,279
what leads to to cyber attacks in the

810
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,520
end like george mentioned with

811
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
some simple measures we could reduce the

812
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,279
risk and the the investment in reducing

813
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,720
this risk is

814
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
considerably low if you if you take into

815
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,720
account that people want to learn they

816
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
don't want to make error that they don't

817
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,399
want to make failures so

818
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
if you put humans in the center of your

819
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,440
strategy that not only means to invest

820
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,200
in technology it means to invest in

821
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,360
competencies um in in self trust yeah

822
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
enable the people um and that's then

823
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,679
actually that's more than i.t security

824
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,360
is more like information security

825
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,159
because human behavior will act upon

826
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,159
what i do understand where i see sense

827
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,640
in in acting or doing things it's like i

828
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,760
compare it with with normal traffic yes

829
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,919
we all we have uh

830
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,679
in in normal traffic we all behave

831
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,080
safely and we get from a to b and uh

832
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
we're not risking our lives so on the

833
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
digital highway we're risking our lives

834
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
because we just may not have the

835
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,760
competency to go from a to b without

836
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,000
making the mistake of clicking that link

837
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,880
and uh i think things are getting more

838
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,960
strange uh if you take into account that

839
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,440
we have uh synthetic voices and and deep

840
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,159
fake technology that um that makes us

841
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,399
talk to people and we are not even we

842
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,120
not even can be sure if these people

843
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,039
if the people we're talking to are the

844
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,000
people that we expect to be so put the

845
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,279
humans in this

846
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,360
center of biology means to to apply

847
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
trainings in a way different from what

848
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,159
we from what we did in the past like we

849
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,200
always have a problem in ig security

850
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
message because the message is very

851
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
technical yeah so bring let's bring us

852
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
to a different level in communicating to

853
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,360
the people communicate just um in terms

854
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,080
of understandable language in terms of

855
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
information security like

856
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,720
enabling this behavior this rational

857
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,240
behavior in the digital highway

858
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,600
environment

859
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,039
to make sure that people not only

860
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,840
behave but also do not make the mistakes

861
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,039
that they are tricked into by the

862
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,399
technologies

863
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,959
of today

864
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,480
thank you very much avid

865
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,279
phil we have been discussing how small

866
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,440
companies within a supply chain can can

867
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,360
be a bit of a challenge i'd like to turn

868
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
this around a little bit uh so that we

869
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
ask ourselves for for a minute as the

870
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,480
the large companies in the game um what

871
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,559
can you do to to bring more security to

872
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,879
others

873
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,200
yeah well i i think the the interesting

874
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,039
thing for you know particularly for

875
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,919
large

876
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,559
cloud companies but you know any large

877
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,880
kind of service provider the

878
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,960
small medium-sized enterprises and even

879
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,600
now very large enterprises and public

880
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,679
sector organizations and governments use

881
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,519
you know really the way to think about

882
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,960
this is that

883
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
the cloud has more than surpassed the

884
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,039
security of on-premise environments and

885
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
that's especially true for small to

886
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
medium-sized enterprises you may not be

887
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
able to effectively resource an i.t team

888
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,000
let alone a large enough and

889
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,320
sophisticated enough security team of of

890
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,640
depth to protect themselves so so

891
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,880
tapping into a you know a reputable

892
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
cloud service provider or other type of

893
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
service provider that maintains that

894
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,039
high degree of security and control

895
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,919
where

896
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,360
securities designed in not bolted on

897
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,679
after the fact where it it just comes as

898
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,360
a part of the environment if you like

899
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,679
it's a secure product not just a

900
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,640
security product and and and that goes

901
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,399
for cloud providers the same thing

902
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,840
happens in the communication

903
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
collaboration tool environment for

904
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
example you know what we deploy with

905
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,480
google workspace to small medium and

906
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
large enterprises is where we're

907
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,279
increasingly putting security defaults

908
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,720
in you know reflective of some of the

909
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
things that george talked about earlier

910
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,840
in terms of default levels of stronger

911
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,919
authentication default levels of of

912
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,039
email protection encryption malware

913
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,880
filtering and a whole array of other

914
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,679
tools that generally make the platform

915
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,919
safer by design and just safer to use

916
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,519
without having to spend a lot of time

917
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
administering and adding in

918
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,279
security after the fact and that's

919
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,360
particularly important again not just

920
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,120
because small medium

921
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,799
sized businesses

922
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,480
don't have a large budget for these

923
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
things they also don't have a large

924
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
staff as i mentioned before to

925
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,919
administer and manage these things

926
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,360
and finally the thing i would say as

927
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
well it's worth remembering that you

928
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,279
know cloud in particular but other large

929
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,679
service providers increasingly we're

930
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,640
acting like a a digital immune system

931
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,760
where for a small medium-sized company

932
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,240
you know taking every update we provide

933
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,080
and the same goes for large companies

934
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,240
we're driving out we're pushing out

935
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,399
hundreds of different security updates

936
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,799
every month that are reflective of our

937
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,799
lessons learned on the need for control

938
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,080
improvements feature requests from large

939
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,600
companies with large security teams

940
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,279
product features that come as a result

941
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,360
of our threat and vulnerability research

942
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
so again if you're a small medium-sized

943
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,360
enterprise sitting back and taking every

944
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,440
update we provide is just going to

945
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,919
propel your security forward without a

946
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,600
lot of effort and a lot of costs and i

947
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
think that's one of the great dynamics

948
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
now that we're seeing in the industry uh

949
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,880
with cloud providers being able to do to

950
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,559
offer that capability especially to

951
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,360
small businesses

952
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,000
thank you very much

953
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
um

954
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,039
i can still remember

955
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
being the ceo of a large organization

956
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,159
and i was swamped every day people

957
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,239
bringing great security solutions to my

958
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,079
table but you just can't look at ten of

959
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,800
them every day of the week um actually

960
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,199
given given your industry perspective if

961
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,239
you

962
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,719
had to name two or three

963
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,359
uh ideas or solutions to the supply

964
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,040
chain um

965
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
cyber security issues what should people

966
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,399
be focusing on from your perspective

967
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,079
at the end what i think they need to

968
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
have is a

969
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
holistic view on things and just working

970
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,679
on the

971
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,320
on the biggest let's say white spots

972
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,918
they have in their in their

973
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,520
infrastructure and that's very often

974
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
overseen yes they take the

975
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,599
the standard updates

976
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,159
nothing against against that and they do

977
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,159
softer up uploads

978
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
and try to improve the system but i

979
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,720
think

980
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,560
they need first of all the holistic view

981
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,359
on the on the i.t security secondly

982
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,359
just coming back one sec to exo i think

983
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
we need to provide some clear messages

984
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,800
and framework to the companies to give

985
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,000
them some

986
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,839
guidance and orientation that's still

987
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,079
missing and exactly what you said

988
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,839
they are they sometimes are lost which i

989
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,119
fully can understand they don't have

990
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
large it departments they just buy the

991
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,320
stuff they can get from the market and

992
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,240
trust that software downloads and

993
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,400
updates will work well

994
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
uh so they need to have some guidance

995
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,760
reference points and that's something

996
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,280
what we need to provide also on the

997
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,119
on the exo side on the on the total

998
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,640
european market from that point of view

999
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,160
coming back to the solutions to the

1000
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,599
market of course

1001
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,280
um

1002
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
there are

1003
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,960
of course a lot of aspects we believe

1004
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,880
software only will not

1005
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
will not make it but

1006
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,400
in the cloud it's a different point of

1007
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,760
course but still a lot of stuff is

1008
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
running on a physical side you need to

1009
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
have a good understanding of the

1010
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
hardware and we just see that

1011
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,400
vulnerability of just pure software

1012
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,839
stacks on top of the hardware you don't

1013
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,280
have an understanding so i think they

1014
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,839
need to have some sort of platform here

1015
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,440
on that one

1016
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,599
at the end it comes to the human factor

1017
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,520
i think couple of times it has been said

1018
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
you have to make sure that you have a

1019
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,119
good eid system and that not everyone

1020
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,119
has access to you to the

1021
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,040
to your framework and not getting some

1022
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,119
sort of administration role without

1023
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,800
having the really the

1024
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,640
the competence and the

1025
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,920
and the rights for that because very

1026
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,839
often we'll see and also most of the

1027
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,839
malware software works like okay we'll

1028
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,200
take so

1029
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
take over some sort of administration

1030
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,640
view and then we destroy the system or

1031
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,000
take out the data

1032
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,560
so there are a couple of um

1033
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
things on the id man eid management

1034
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,880
holistic view not software hardware full

1035
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,960
understanding so there are like three

1036
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,359
four topics i think the company should

1037
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,520
focus on to have some sort of decent

1038
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,040
security and just keep up with the

1039
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,839
market dynamics

1040
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,000
thank you very much

1041
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,520
george maybe you can help me with

1042
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,040
something there's something that i heard

1043
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,880
a couple of times today so there was

1044
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,359
janie steli saying we need this mfa

1045
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,400
thing you sent me this mfa thing now i'm

1046
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,560
asking on behalf of uh

1047
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,640
those people who maybe are not totally

1048
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,119
sure what that is and why they need it

1049
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,960
could you elaborate a little bit

1050
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,720
yeah and and by the way we cannot be

1051
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,560
more in agreement with directories early

1052
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,720
on this uh moving beyond passwords and

1053
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,640
enabling mfa or moving to unhackable

1054
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,119
passwords here's the thing imagine

1055
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,440
having something available to you that

1056
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,359
can take away by all accounts by any

1057
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,040
report you've ever read ninety percent

1058
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,880
of the attacks against you which are

1059
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,040
based on credentials theft and

1060
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,760
credential reuse and not using it and to

1061
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,440
me this is exactly the problem you're

1062
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,880
seeing with this

1063
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,680
without moving beyond passwords if you

1064
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,440
simply enable a second factor if you

1065
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,520
simply move to hackable passwords and

1066
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,599
there's many solutions out there

1067
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,640
you know

1068
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,960
you're already in a better space yet

1069
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,720
report after report after the report

1070
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
comes up that shows that many of the

1071
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
smaller medium businesses even bigger

1072
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,839
enterprises have not moved to a

1073
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,000
multi-factor or to a

1074
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
hackable passport scenario

1075
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,599
and to me this is an area where if you

1076
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,079
can take a goal that is undisputable

1077
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,320
right an easy solution to some of the

1078
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,160
problems and we don't succeed as a

1079
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
community as a global community then you

1080
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,400
know it's kind of hard to talk about all

1081
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,440
other security measures so to me just

1082
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,800
literally all we have to do is take a

1083
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,359
page out of the climate change

1084
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,720
programs and say you know what let's

1085
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
just set up some really big ambitious

1086
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,480
goals and start doing things like

1087
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,160
eliminate single factor uh you know

1088
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,040
you know

1089
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
reduce the flow of patching and so on

1090
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
and we can move as a community together

1091
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
uh trying to improve the security

1092
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,800
um

1093
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,079
the other thing is this is something

1094
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,160
that is not cheap you know enabling mfa

1095
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,839
is not a cheap solution it is a

1096
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
technically uh challenging thing so the

1097
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,839
challenge to the conference is make it

1098
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,200
easy

1099
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
make it cheaper make it effective and

1100
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,400
then we can all move uh together

1101
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,200
thank you very much

1102
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,760
we have a little bit of time left so i'd

1103
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,119
ask each of you to maybe give one final

1104
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,280
statement to the audience

1105
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,040
what should people bear in mind about

1106
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
this session what is it that they should

1107
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,960
be doing tomorrow morning or latest

1108
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,040
monday morning what's your perspective

1109
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,680
maybe let's start with phil again this

1110
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,359
time

1111
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,680
yeah so like i would echo a lot of the

1112
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,920
the sentiment that's come up during this

1113
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,800
panel which is it's it's important to

1114
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,079
make sure

1115
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,240
that the secure path is the easiest path

1116
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,800
this is an in many respects an economics

1117
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,520
and an incentives problem that if we

1118
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,079
provide the right behavioral nudges the

1119
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,640
right solutions the right secure default

1120
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,680
behaviors if we make available

1121
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
stronger forms of authentication that

1122
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,160
are usable cost effective and integrated

1123
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,640
with the services that people use and we

1124
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,280
strive to make sure that technology and

1125
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,119
other companies are delivering

1126
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,680
secure products where securities built

1127
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,079
in by design not bolted on after the

1128
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,320
fact and it's just available as a

1129
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,079
default for

1130
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,040
end users consumers small businesses

1131
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,119
large businesses governments the more we

1132
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,720
keep doing that then i think the more

1133
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,040
we're on the on the right path of just

1134
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,280
making sure security is the

1135
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,599
is the easiest path

1136
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,839
thank you arvid what do you think

1137
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,160
um i could not agree more with phil

1138
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,640
however also focus on the on the people

1139
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,040
so put them actually in the center so

1140
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,359
focus on their competencies and make it

1141
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,960
very easy for them to understand to

1142
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,440
follow and to see the purpose of uh

1143
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
of the measures taken

1144
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,680
so my advice would actually be invest

1145
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,400
more in in the competencies wherever

1146
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,319
people are and that actually starts in

1147
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,880
schools because um we're talking about

1148
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,640
our problems today they will not there

1149
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,240
will not be better tomorrow they're

1150
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880
getting worse so we we need to invest

1151
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,599
more into our our children also so that

1152
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,599
they grow up

1153
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,160
not digitally native

1154
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,119
not digitally native but digital uh

1155
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,000
secure

1156
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,119
thank you

1157
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,000
george

1158
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,680
what's your statement

1159
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
i'm going to be very monolithic here

1160
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,800
move beyond passwords let's just start

1161
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
with that let's just set up a goal and

1162
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,440
just help

1163
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,280
everybody just move beyond passwords and

1164
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
i think

1165
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
then you start the wheel going and then

1166
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
we start adding new chapters into this

1167
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,920
book of security to start with one

1168
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,520
though

1169
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,240
thanks a lot axel

1170
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,280
uh

1171
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,359
three topics first of all multi-factor

1172
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,599
authentication that's a great great

1173
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,560
start

1174
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,119
on the policy side policy maker side we

1175
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,800
need to provide them the companies a

1176
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,880
clear framework easier to understand

1177
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
than in the past

1178
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,280
and secondly i think or thirdly a lot of

1179
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,520
companies are in the verge of getting to

1180
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
the next level of digitalization moving

1181
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,040
their infrastructure to the cloud i

1182
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
think now it's also

1183
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,079
an opportunity for them to think

1184
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,400
long-term and integrate in their

1185
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
upscale infrastructure

1186
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,240
right at the beginning i.t security and

1187
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,839
that would help us a lot in the future

1188
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,040
when we build the next level of

1189
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,680
infrastructure
