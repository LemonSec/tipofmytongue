1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,960
thank you so very very much uh for that

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,200
kind introduction and welcome to our

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,880
panel um to our spotlight discussion

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
between a rock and a hard place

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
anticipating future cyber security

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
challenges in this spotlight

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,480
we want to

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,720
do a little bit of a deep dive on the

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
future challenges but then really also

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,800
identify what we can do about it across

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,558
policy fields

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,719
across business policy makers experts

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,360
and so on and what i really hope

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,320
is

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,160
that we

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
can answer

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,239
to the motto of the munich

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
security conference of this year which

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,039
is

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,120
unlearning helplessness

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
and i hope that after our panel

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,199
discussion

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
we will know that we are not helpless

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,800
and that we actually can do um quite a

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,360
bit if we do it uh together and for this

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,320
i have a really excellent uh panel i'm

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,560
delighted to welcome general david

28

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
which the general established in may

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
2013.

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
and you have made it your mission um to

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
i i hope i'm right to improve uh cyber

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
security um by working with experts

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
business leaders and entrepreneurs but

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,439
also by teaching at the stanford

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
university

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,840
and get students met on board on this

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
process and jeff moss

fellow in many institutions and on the

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,000
board of many think tanks

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,239
i'm very very happy to have all three of

53
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,160
you um today

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120
in this spotlight discussion

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
to prepare

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,360
for moderating this discussion i took a

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
look at the latest world economic forum

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,840
global risk report and what i found

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
staggering were a couple of numbers

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
and especially two

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
and the report found that in 2020

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
malware and ransomware attacks increased

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,879
by

64
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,360
358 and 435

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
respectively in 2020. i think this

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,040
underlines really um what we are talking

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
about but you are the experts and what i

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
want to start out with a short round i'm

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,400
asking all of you what do you see are

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,040
the greatest cyber security challenges

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,640
in the next 10 to 15 years and i would

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
love to start with you general

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
well thanks very much stormy it's great

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
to see you again and it's really

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
wonderful to be with two true legends in

76
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,200
the cyber field obviously alex and jeff

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,040
and i must say it's also great to be in

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
munich uh even if i am zooming in from

79
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
my hotel room uh

80
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,599
um

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,400
but first i i want to focus on two

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
issues uh that are in addition to the

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
colossal challenges that really were

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
already highlighted

85
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
and have been re-highlighted but the

86
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,599
first two speakers identified those of

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,840
filling the enormous shortage of cyber

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
security professionals

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
and also building the culture uh that

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
system director jen easterly uh

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
described as hugely important also i

92
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
hear i just might note that i have

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
continued gratitude to her

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,120
for what she did back in

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,000
iraq uh not as in iraq between a rock

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,040
and a hard place but really in iraq um

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
back during the surge in iraq when she

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
came out from nsa just for a week and

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,000
went home six months later after

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
building what has become known as the

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,799
cyber

102
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
fusion capability the real-time regional

103
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,279
gateway that as she noted during her

104
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
remarks earlier in this session

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
literally took thousands of seriously

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,840
bad guys uh off the battlefield the two

107
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,560
want issues on which i'd like to focus

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,320
uh again

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
cyber security uh challenges

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
the first is i think the single biggest

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,479
and this is embracing and

112
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,600
operationalizing something that is very

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,199
very challenging it

114
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,479
uh it is

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,160
uh understanding that no cyber security

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
uh application or product can by itself

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
provide

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
adequate cyber security rather what is

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
needed is a comprehensive integrated

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
managed cyber security solution based on

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,840
zero trust principles that is an

122
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
enormously big idea and it's even more

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
enormously difficult to operationalize

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
it typically requires somewhere between

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,479
80 and

126
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,120
90 or so applications and products all

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
of which must be integratable

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
can be actually installed managed

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,320
constantly updated uh overseen by knob

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,400
center and again based

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,199
on the idea of zero trust principles as

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,840
well um and again this i think is the

133
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,919
single biggest of the big ideas about

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
cyber security uh and also the one that

135
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,800
is in many cases the most elusive um the

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
second huge challenge

137
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,600
um i think is the growing imperative um

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
we've known about this for a long time

139
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,680
but it just seems as if ever more

140
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,400
important that we figure out how to do

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
much greater sharing of threat

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,759
intelligence

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
at real time at machine speed driven by

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
algorithms not by people not you know a

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,280
call from the fbi's field office to you

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,199
saying you've been hacked but a machine

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,039
notification noting that of course there

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
are certain ecosystems

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
certain areas of infrastructure in the

150
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
united states for example that are

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,319
uh really quite well integrated and

152
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
the gold standard would be the uh the

153
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,720
banking sector the financial sector just

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
because they have to the the penalties

155
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
for a breach are so enormous and the

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
treasury department does a very good job

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,639
of overseeing that but that is really

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,360
the outlier the norm is not that and

159
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,160
despite the new initiative uh the cyber

160
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,479
security defense collaborative which

161
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
cisa is pursuing which i commend uh very

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,039
strongly we've got to build out

163
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
something much much larger

164
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,680
and to figure out how to do that

165
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
with trusted networks and again get this

166
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
going at machine speed rather than at

167
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,919
the speed of a human and so those would

168
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,919
be the two that i would nominate

169
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,240
for the academy award and the two most

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
difficult cyber security challenges out

171
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,759
there

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
thank you so much general and we

173
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
certainly will come back to the question

174
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
of how to get there as well

175
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
in the second round but first uh let us

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
now also hear from jeff um what do you

177
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
think are you in your point of view the

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
greatest challenges

179
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
um so there's a couple i mean we could

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
talk all day uh in nuance but i think

181
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
the big picture for this audience is

182
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,319
um

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,880
the movement uh into the political realm

184
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
uh the movement into the geopolitical

185
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
realm of some of these things that were

186
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,560
niche concepts

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
concerns of cisos but not really the

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
general public definitely not really at

189
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
a national political level that that are

190
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
now um

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
so let me point to maybe two things

192
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,479
when stuxnet first happened

193
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,720
one of the reactions was that oh look

194
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
there's a new tool in the toolkit of

195
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,599
proportional response where

196
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,800
we can now do these sort of cyberkinetic

197
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
responses without having to blow up a

198
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,759
power plant we can do it or with a very

199
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
targeted very focused you know effect

200
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,560
speed forward to the modern day

201
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,039
china and india have a skirmish on their

202
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,240
border

203
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
and

204
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
what is their response

205
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
well india decides to ban apps from

206
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
their app store chinese apps that are

207
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,680
generating money for chinese businesses

208
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,759
are banned in india sort of this app

209
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,840
diplomacy has started

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
china can't easily respond because

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,479
china's preemptively banned all the

212
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,479
indian apps there are no indian apps on

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
the chinese app store

214
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,760
and so

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
you're starting to see other countries

216
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
adopt

217
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
in their political responses

218
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,479
technological

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
capabilities and so i think that's

220
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,959
pretty new the other new thing is really

221
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
the political targeting of malware

222
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,000
a few years ago really malware was quite

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
small there wasn't a lot of there was

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
some research and development in it but

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
it was not

226
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
like today's environment and i think a

227
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
lot of that can be driven by it has been

228
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
driven by nation state

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,959
interests

230
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,399
imposing costs through a third party um

231
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,399
on certain western countries

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,120
specifically united states um

233
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,399
well that has a knock-on effect

234
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
everybody learns right attacks never get

235
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
um

236
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
simpler i mean never get harder they

237
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
only get simpler and so now the real

238
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
criminals have also learned those

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
techniques so i think we're going to be

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
operating in that environment and you

241
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
layer that whole thing and you drop it

242
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
on a multi-tenant cloud

243
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
kind of centralized environment where

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
everything is dual use and if any one of

245
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
the tenants on the cloud are attacked

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
it's essentially as if all of them are

247
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
intact if it's a ddos against the

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
infrastructure and so

249
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
we're we're walking toward this more

250
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
fragile more centralized infrastructure

251
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,040
for efficiency's sake and and every one

252
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,560
of these things has a big political

253
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
component that we're going to have to

254
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
deal with

255
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,320
thank you very much jeff and alex i saw

256
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
you nodding a couple of times so my hand

257
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
over immediately to you

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
yeah well i agree with everything uh the

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
general and jeff said i i think to build

260
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
on both what the general said around

261
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,279
workforce development and jeff on the

262
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,160
geopolitics from my perspective one of

263
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,959
the

264
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,440
kind of driving issues of the last five

265
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
six years that i think will continue for

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,160
the next 10

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,320
is that the line

268
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
over which an organization is important

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
enough to have the top level adversaries

270
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,399
people who are real true professionals

271
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,800
who will spend six months nine months a

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
year trying to break into one

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
organization that line has only

274
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
constantly moved down over the last 20

275
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
years right if you look at the early

276
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
2000s we have

277
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
intrusions by chinese groups and russian

278
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
groups against the defense industrial

279
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
base the northrop grummans the bae

280
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
systems and the like the air buses

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
and then you have oil and gas and you

282
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,120
have the big banks and 2009 you have the

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,279
attacks against the tech industry and so

284
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
we've seen more and more industries end

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
up on the list of

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
companies that have to worry about this

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
the truth is that that line is almost at

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
the floor now that any organization

289
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,839
larger than a mom and pop shop now is

290
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,519
possibly facing really high-end

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
professional attackers either because

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,839
the definition of what is a legitimate

293
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,399
target of state actors has broadened

294
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,560
extremely widely or because of

295
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,959
ransomware because of the incredible

296
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
amount of money in the the point the

297
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
post cryptocurrency era the incredible

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,000
amount of money that people can

299
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,920
legitimately make hacking when jeff and

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,519
i were coming up when we when i was

301
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,600
going to defcon when i was 17 years old

302
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
um and jeff was a slightly uh older uh

303
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,279
which he looks younger now but i just

304
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,040
want to make for the the record that

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
jeff is is definitely older than me um

306
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,720
uh

307
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,279
that uh you know when i was 17 years old

308
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,519
you couldn't go be a professional hacker

309
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,720
and make millions and millions of

310
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,399
dollars a year it actually that's kind

311
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,480
of that's kind of a rumor that existed

312
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,800
but actually getting away with stealing

313
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
all that money and spending the rest of

314
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
your life on an island was extremely

315
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,839
difficult and today we you on a normal

316
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,680
tuesday you might have a hundred million

317
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,839
dollar theft or a massive ransom being

318
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,480
paid um and so the the change in the

319
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
economics and the change in the the

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,279
alignment of state companies of state

321
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,440
organized actors means that the threat

322
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
profile for most organizations got way

323
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
worse and those organizations are not

324
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
ready i do a lot of work with big

325
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,560
companies in the u.s and i would

326
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,399
estimate that maybe half of the fortune

327
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
500 of the largest 500 publicly traded

328
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
companies in the u.s have a modern

329
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
defensive outlook on cyber that they

330
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
have something approaching a zero trust

331
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
architecture that they have edr

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,680
capabilities that allow them to monitor

333
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
all their endpoints they have logging

334
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,639
and

335
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,399
timelining capability on a single pane

336
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,600
of glass

337
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,279
that they have the ability to to track

338
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,440
and isolate individuals conditional

339
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
access controls that allow them to make

340
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
decisions of whether somebody's

341
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,000
trustworthy or not

342
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
passwordless architectures probably only

343
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,519
half of the big companies and i expect

344
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
that's the same for the dax in germany

345
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
if you look at those 40 companies maybe

346
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,079
half of them are ready to play at this

347
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,680
level and half of them aren't and we

348
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
don't have anywhere near the amount of

349
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
talent necessary to get all of those

350
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
organizations up and running and we're

351
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,839
not just talking about the fortune 500

352
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,519
and the dax 40 anymore we're talking

353
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,800
about thousands and thousands of

354
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,839
companies that are up there i think

355
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,360
that's one of the lessons of last year

356
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
when you have companies like solarwinds

357
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,399
which is a company that nobody had ever

358
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
heard of outside of a small number of

359
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
i.t folks becoming a

360
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
major component in a state actors

361
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
campaign against western interests

362
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,040
that's the kind of thing that we're

363
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
going to see more and more of over the

364
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
next decade

365
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,000
yeah thank you so much all three of you

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
mentioned um that the borders between

367
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,880
politics

368
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
geo economics

369
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
and technology are more and more

370
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,519
blurring

371
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
and one

372
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
maybe it's not the right word to say but

373
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
playground of geopolitical actors is

374
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
currently the ukraine

375
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,000
and um alex i would like to um ask you

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
how are

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,000
how is the cyber security

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
environment in such a conflict how our

379
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
company is also dealing with us

380
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,000
preparing for it um

381
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
please

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
yeah so i first i just want to say is

383
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,079
you know while this is a conference

384
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,360
about cyber and i want to talk about

385
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
that obviously that's our area of

386
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
expertise um we're on the verge of a

387
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,800
massive humanitarian crisis you know

388
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
with the largest potential invasion in

389
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
europe since 1939 and the first use of

390
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
kind of um you know the general is the

391
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
expert in this but i don't think we have

392
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
a good example of kind of modern

393
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
combined arms uh between two adversaries

394
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
like this against each other so um i

395
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
just want to say like i think we all

396
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
should be cognizant of the the human

397
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
impact here outside of cyber because

398
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,360
it's gonna be horrible um i think a lot

399
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
of people are expecting that there will

400
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
be you know based upon russian activity

401
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,680
in 2008 and 2014 um tied to a variety of

402
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
their uh of their you know kind of

403
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,399
foreign adventures um that there will be

404
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,560
some kind of hybrid warfare that is

405
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
going on here we perhaps are saying the

406
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
start of that um there have been denial

407
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
of service attacks against the ukrainian

408
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,600
government um the ukrainian uh media

409
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
right so you start to have as as putin

410
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
ratchets up the pressure on ukraine the

411
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,160
use of a variety of cyber techniques to

412
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
try to raise the pressure on ukrainians

413
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,800
and give them and to instill fear by

414
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
cutting them off from from sensitive

415
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
areas of information i think the

416
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
immediate target will be in any russian

417
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
invasion that communications networks

418
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,120
right that's one of the big differences

419
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
between now and previous conflicts and

420
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
that a huge amount of the commanding

421
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
control that happens with a military

422
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,480
like ukraine's is based upon the

423
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,079
civilian network right and we do have

424
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,680
stories of this um that i'm sure the

425
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,279
general can tell about you know american

426
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
soldiers buying uh iridium satellite

427
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
phones because they work better uh you

428
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
know than than the initial equipment

429
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
they're given and such um we'll see the

430
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
same thing in ukraine where a lot of the

431
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,199
command and control are gonna be

432
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,320
happening off of people's individual

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
phones on the public network on the

434
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
public internet um ukraine has their own

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
teleco companies they also have a lot of

436
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,320
telco that's actually run out of central

437
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,120
europe and western europe and so um if

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,519
you know from a russian perspective uh

439
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
those those are gonna be like those are

440
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
gonna be legitimate targets and then i i

441
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,720
would expect that if we end up with a

442
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
nato response that part of the russian

443
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,839
goal to deter nato from backing ukraine

444
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,639
will be to attack um critical key

445
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
infrastructure uh and companies in the

446
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
west um now how much they turn that up

447
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,399
and how far they go up the cyber

448
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,920
escalation ladder i think is a big

449
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,959
question because one of the things we've

450
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
never seen before is we've never seen

451
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,519
the us and our allies kind of unleash

452
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
our offensive cyber capabilities and it

453
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,680
is unclear what that escalation ladder

454
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
looks like between the west and russia

455
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
yeah thank you so much um jeff you

456
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,759
mentioned that our

457
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
vulnerability is pretty high or has

458
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,240
increased because also of concentration

459
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,279
and uh due to efficiency reasons um and

460
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,639
that there's a lot of critical

461
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,639
infrastructure and alex just pointed

462
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
that out as well

463
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,680
have we not learned from previous crises

464
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
oh we've we've learned but but the

465
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
economic drivers are such that

466
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,720
efficiency wins you know efficiency wins

467
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
almost every argument

468
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,279
and

469
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,799
and i wanted to pick up on on some of

470
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,799
the themes alex was talking about which

471
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,599
is um in this

472
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,799
conflict

473
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,000
we haven't seen any real effort um

474
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,199
maybe

475
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,319
besides the financial fs fsi sacs

476
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
for information sharing or coordination

477
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
is

478
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,319
more and more dependence on civil

479
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,919
civilian

480
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
infrastructure and so in that

481
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
environment is there a responsibility or

482
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,960
is there something that the government

483
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,440
should be doing to sort of say

484
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
hey

485
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
critical infrastructure operators or

486
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,400
telco or non-critical infrastructure

487
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
operators like twitter

488
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
heads up there's going to be conflict we

489
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
think switch to

490
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,880
plan b switch to red alert whatever that

491
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,679
is

492
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,080
and then that signals to industry like

493
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
okay we're going into a potential

494
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
conflict um

495
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
what do we do we start checking our bgp

496
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
routes to make sure people aren't

497
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
hijacking us we run a full backup on all

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
of our data so if there is a destructive

499
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
event we're good right now we were going

500
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,919
to do it monthly but we just got this

501
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
heads up from our government we're doing

502
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,799
it now

503
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,840
um

504
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
are there things now that when i was

505
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,919
really young alex um you know we had

506
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
duck and cover because we still had the

507
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,799
shadow of nuclear war with russia

508
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,799
and so there were sort of preparedness

509
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,080
drills

510
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,039
do we have a civilian government

511
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,440
coordinated drill that we're supposed to

512
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,400
do

513
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,919
because it really seems like everything

514
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
we're talking about is the onus is good

515
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,200
and the harm is going to be on the

516
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,559
civilian infrastructure and cloud

517
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
providers and telco the average citizens

518
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
yet they're not really included in any

519
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
of the coordination or response

520
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
um planning

521
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,400
and i think that's a big gap that

522
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
incidents like ukraine and russia are

523
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,159
going to force us to have to adapt to

524
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,559
general again i saw you nodding a few

525
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,240
times

526
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,840
it would be great if you could also pick

527
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
up that question

528
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,960
well first i mean to answer what jeff uh

529
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
was discussing

530
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,280
we have to recognize that the cyber

531
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
security and infrastructure security

532
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
agency was established to do just that

533
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
the problem was it wasn't established

534
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
until about two and a half years ago in

535
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
fact it was established by

536
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,520
alex's now partner in the krebs damos

537
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,480
group

538
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
chris krebs who did a wonderful job

539
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
uh but

540
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,679
even part of that time the government

541
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,600
was shut down actually and so again

542
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,960
they've made a lot of dramatic progress

543
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
uh and they're the ones who do oversee

544
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,480
the

545
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
cyber security for these different i

546
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
think it's 16 areas that are designated

547
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,400
as critical infrastructure as i

548
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
mentioned earlier you have sort of the

549
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
gold standard that's sort of the banking

550
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,320
sector the financial sector

551
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
treasury department oversees that and

552
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,280
what you have are departments and

553
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
agencies that oversee these different

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
areas that fall within their purview

555
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,240
some cisa keeps itself like election

556
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
security famously of course

557
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
was overseen and you'll recall chris

558
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,679
krebs

559
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,320
assessing that the last election was uh

560
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,559
you know very very secure and so forth

561
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,080
um so

562
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
here you have the united states uh

563
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,520
leading the economy in the world that's

564
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
actually behind the others

565
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
we started after those we heard earlier

566
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,520
actually an earlier session from the

567
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
united kingdom's cyber security uh

568
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,559
center they're way ahead of us uh they

569
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
have a better partnership with their

570
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,720
version of nsa gchq

571
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
very good public private

572
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
sisa again terrific

573
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
founding director great uh subsequent

574
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,600
the second director jen easterly but a

575
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,919
lot of work to do and really to make up

576
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,760
for i mean a lot of us i think all three

577
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
of us were advocating

578
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,080
for this kind of organization

579
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
for years before it was finally uh

580
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,280
established so that's number one um

581
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,120
number two uh it is very clear that uh

582
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,360
cyber security is increasingly national

583
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
security uh for the reasons that were

584
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
mentioned and then beyond that when it

585
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
comes if i put my uniform back on again

586
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,440
cyberspace is now a domain of warfare so

587
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
you you know you have the traditional

588
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,080
ground sea air now space and subsea and

589
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,000
you have cyberspace

590
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,559
uh and it is an actual place in which

591
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,120
warfare actually is ongoing on a daily

592
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
basis uh you know the millions of cyber

593
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
attacks that take place uh every single

594
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,720
day many of which do target uh elements

595
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
of our defense department and other

596
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
areas of uh critical infrastructure so

597
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,679
again we can very much expect uh to see

598
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
because again russia has

599
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,039
pioneered some of this to a degree at

600
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,120
least actually used it

601
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,080
more to some degree than other countries

602
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
that if they conduct a ground invasion

603
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
they're also going to be conducting a

604
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,799
massive set of cyber attacks to bring

605
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,039
down the networks of the ukrainian

606
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,039
forces who are trying to respond to what

607
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,760
it is that the russians are doing so and

608
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,120
there will be much more than that there

609
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
will be exploitation of social media

610
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,480
putting out false uh information uh in

611
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
in all the rest so

612
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,200
again

613
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,760
very very substantial component of this

614
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
uh all of what we're talking about uh

615
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
cyberspace and cyber security uh from

616
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
what used to be just sort of a niche

617
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
back in the day

618
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
jeff please i saw your hand

619
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,360
yeah um so this this cyber as fifth

620
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,480
domain um is fascinating um because

621
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
unlike the other four domains um cyber

622
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,159
adapts and it changes

623
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,919
and atlantic council put out a paper i

624
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,640
don't know a long time ago now um about

625
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
saving the future

626
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
for our children uh on the cyberspace

627
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
and the idea goes that every time we

628
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,360
fight in cyberspace or um get into a

629
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,559
political debate in cyberspace um it

630
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,039
will adapt right routes will change

631
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
operating systems will be upgraded um

632
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
that doesn't happen if you shoot down an

633
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
airplane the sky is still there you sink

634
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,080
a boat the ocean is still there tank on

635
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
the land land is still there not

636
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
cyberspace not the fifth domain the

637
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
fifth domain will change every time you

638
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,440
tamper with it

639
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
and the concern is we tamper with the

640
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
fifth domain too many times we might not

641
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,039
like what we're left with

642
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,679
unfortunately time is running so fast

643
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,679
and i don't want to go

644
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,400
to close this spotlight talk with a

645
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,640
feeling of helplessness

646
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,080
now we want to

647
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
be helpful

648
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
and how do we overcome these challenges

649
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
and i would like to ask all of you again

650
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,960
to identify your two big

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
um

652
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,880
general oscar-winning

653
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,960
[Music]

654
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,600
ideas

655
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,440
[Music]

656
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,279
who wants to go first alex

657
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,799
again with us

658
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
go ahead general i i identified the two

659
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
areas that are the big challenges you

660
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,440
actually have to respond in those two

661
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,679
areas as well so you have to

662
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,600
again make the creation of a

663
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
comprehensive integrated managed cyber

664
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
security solution based on zero trust

665
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
principles

666
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,919
the standard

667
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,840
that's what it is that you are going to

668
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,679
want to establish

669
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,440
and then in in the other area

670
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
general you are muted

671
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
we have to figure out how to share

672
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,640
uh at real time

673
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
threat information and the threat

674
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,320
mitigating measures you know what is the

675
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
patch what has to be done

676
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
uh so that's not done with the speed of

677
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,600
a human but done at the speed of a

678
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,799
machine

679
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,279
again sysa will be the quarterback for

680
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
an awful lot of this hugely encouraged

681
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,840
by the two great leaders that we have

682
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,440
had there and by the initiatives that

683
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
they're taking but they still need a ton

684
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
of additional authorizations and

685
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
appropriations and our congress in the

686
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
u.s couldn't even get a law that would

687
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
mandate mandatory reporting of breaches

688
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
within 24 hours much less at machine

689
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
speed so we have our work cut out for us

690
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
without question thanks great thank you

691
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
so much uh general i still would like to

692
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
press you a little bit um for this for

693
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
this in time uh communication and uh

694
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,520
passing on uh of data and uh and threat

695
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,240
perceptions or threats are we ready for

696
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,159
this don't do we trust each other enough

697
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
to do this also across borders

698
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,200
well again let's try to get it within

699
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,840
borders first but you heard by the way

700
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
from some of the others earlier in the

701
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,799
sessions

702
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
uh that again other countries are ahead

703
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
of us germany does have a consortium

704
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,960
others have consortiums again the uk

705
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,799
is ahead in certain respects don't get

706
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,720
me wrong the financial sector in the u.s

707
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,880
is really pretty hardwired together

708
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,440
there are various consortia uh and and

709
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,080
to be fair the scale that the us has is

710
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
vastly greater than any of the others as

711
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,559
well and we have states and

712
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,440
uh territories and and reservations and

713
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
everything on top of all of that so the

714
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
challenges are greater but we really are

715
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,320
a bit behind where others have have

716
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
reached

717
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,360
and so we've got to very much pick up

718
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
the pace and yes there will have to be a

719
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
trusted component to that you'll have to

720
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
ensure ways of verifying that for

721
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
example this is not undoable and i'd

722
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,159
leave it to the two real experts on here

723
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,120
jeff and alex i hope to confirm or deny

724
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,520
uh that this is actually possible if

725
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,279
people have the will to do it and are

726
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,000
willing to put the again the financial

727
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,840
resources and authorities behind it

728
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,600
thank you so much uh over to you jeff

729
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,520
um so if i had to pick two

730
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,159
um i want to go with um the wise words

731
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,760
of tony sager

732
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
who

733
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,279
used to run a defensive group at nsa and

734
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
his plan was to automate everything

735
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
because you can't win head-to-head

736
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,080
against all your adversaries so you're

737
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,919
going to have to automate so you

738
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,520
automate all you can then you have to

739
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,159
study what you cannot automate

740
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,080
and then you have to automate that and

741
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
that's one of your only hopes for for

742
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
the future is mass automation and then

743
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
the second thing is i don't think we're

744
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,320
going to get the kind of outcomes

745
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,640
political outcomes that we're hoping for

746
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,480
unless something is done with software

747
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
liability reform

748
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,200
there's liability and everything else in

749
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
life automobiles airplanes but for some

750
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,480
reason the software shrink wrap license

751
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,039
in the software industry is unique

752
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,679
and it's really become an impediment um

753
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,120
and you can reform it in a number of

754
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,600
different ways but i just i see that as

755
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,679
the next barrier that's holding back a

756
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
ton of change

757
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,120
so if uh if i could softer reform and

758
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,360
more automation

759
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
thank you so much and i also would like

760
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,279
to press you on the issue of automation

761
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,240
um

762
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,559
uh the automation is still done

763
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,799
i mean in parts for humans don't don't

764
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,240
we have attention could you build it

765
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,960
yeah so the idea then there is um you're

766
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
trying to free up the human to do the

767
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,200
things that they do best right so

768
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
companies i mean uh computers

769
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,320
are not responsible right they're not

770
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,840
liable

771
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,080
you can't hold a computer accountable so

772
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
therefore

773
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
they should not be making certain

774
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
management decisions

775
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,039
humans should be doing that so we need

776
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,440
to do is make the computers as efficient

777
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,799
as possible in the things they're good

778
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,640
at right automate everything you can and

779
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
that should free up the humans from

780
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
doing the repetitive tasks and let them

781
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
focus on these higher value

782
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,159
decisions

783
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,919
thank you so much and last but not least

784
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,440
alex

785
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,600
yeah so my

786
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
suggestion would be

787
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,880
organizations if they want to play at

788
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
this level if they want to be truly

789
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,399
ready for the kinds of adversaries that

790
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,919
they should they're facing these days

791
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,840
they need to be in a constant mode of

792
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
response

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
organizations need to have internal

794
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,080
capability to investigate and to respond

795
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,679
to potential breaches

796
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,200
and they need to be feeding those

797
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
responders with telemetry data

798
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,279
operational data um on on endpoint data

799
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,760
continuously if you are an organization

800
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,000
over a thousand people and you are not

801
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,679
constantly investigating a potential

802
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,520
security breach then you do not have

803
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,200
enough information you are not playing

804
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
at that level um and then my other

805
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,399
suggestion executives need to just

806
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,159
assume that they've been breached like

807
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,039
the truth is being a cso in in 2022 um

808
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
is you know you have to accept kind of

809
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,720
the inevitability that you are going to

810
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,039
be breached keeping adversaries of this

811
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,799
level out of any reasonably sized

812
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,640
organization is impossible

813
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,520
that doesn't mean we have to have

814
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,679
nihilism and give up what it means is

815
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,440
that we have to focus on the the rest of

816
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,120
the kill chain of the different steps an

817
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,039
adversary has to take to be successful

818
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,120
in their goals and so preventing initial

819
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,559
breach is something you should work on

820
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,240
but not put all your eggs in that basket

821
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
you need to think about all the other

822
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,760
steps the attacker might take and have

823
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
the ability to interrupt their kill

824
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,000
chain before they get to the end

825
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,120
thank you so very much um to sum up we

826
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,440
don't need to be helpless but we need to

827
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
have the political will

828
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,320
to solve the problems this has been a

829
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
huge uh pleasure gentlemen this was a

830
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
firework of ideas and you really

831
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,960
wouldn't have needed me as a moderator

832
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,159
thank you so very much and we go back uh

833
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,840
to uh the plenary
