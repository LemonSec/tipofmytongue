1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,640
um

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,000
hello um

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,880
mike thank you for joining us for mcc

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
2022

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
speaking of

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,000
drifting clouds

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,759
do you think there's a perfect cyber

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,560
storm upon us

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
ah well thank you alex that's a

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
fantastic question um

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,800
you know really there's in my opinion

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,359
there's three global trends

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
that we see happening today that are

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
creating this perfect storm of cyber

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,239
risk and it's just the tip of the

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
iceberg now each of these three trends

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
we see happening um

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
by themselves they are very significant

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
but when you put them all together

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,200
it creates this unbelievable storm of

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,079
risk

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,760
to the globe to the world

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
the first one is these mounting tensions

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
we see between world powers and the

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,239
increasingly digital nature of modern

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
warfare the collateral damage

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,079
from this war the digital war is global

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,640
unpredictable and pervasive

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
the second one is we have this

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
e-revolution i like to call it happening

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
in the logistics automotive and

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
transportation industries and together

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
with that we have this proliferation of

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
smart cities intelligent enterprises and

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,320
digital ports

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
and because of this our attack surface

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
is growing exponentially and there's

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,439
more paths for this digital collateral

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
damage to propagate rapidly through the

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,079
through the globe um and then together

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
if that's not enough you add in this

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
global pandemic yeah so the global

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
pandemic itself has accelerated remote

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
work paradigms and cloud adoption um ten

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,040
years beyond what we were ready to face

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,759
and

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,079
most institutions and people

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
they really weren't ready for this and

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
threat actors are rapidly exploiting

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,520
this

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
now i like to use um an illustration of

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
a hurricane to help explain what i mean

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,439
here because there's also some

54
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,000
opportunity i grew up in texas and in

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,560
florida and on a regular basis almost

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
yearly it seemed we were faced with

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
hurricanes yeah now what happens when a

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
hurricane's coming well you put up

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,200
boards on your windows you you tie down

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,879
things in the yard you bring in things

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
you take your valuables and you secure

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
them you prepare for that storm and you

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,599
don't just prepare yourself you help

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,160
your neighbor also prepare so the whole

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
community they come together to prepare

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
for this storm to weather it together

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
and after it comes they share food and

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
they help each other get through the

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
aftermath

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
and so this is something although we see

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
this storm coming if we come together

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
and we help each other prepare for it

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
then we actually can generate

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
opportunity out of this

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,239
now let's talk about that first trend i

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,040
mentioned okay that first trend is this

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
tension this mounting tension between

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
world powers we see what's happening

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
with russia and with the ukraine and

80
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
this increasingly digital nature of

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
warfare is something significant cyber

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
really is the tool of choice

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
um especially during recent in these

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,159
emerging conflicts

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,519
you know i come from a military

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
background and there's basically two

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
modes of conflict right you have a

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
direct frontal attack

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
and then you have this covert subversive

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,360
and undercover kind of attack and i like

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
to use an illustration also to explain

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
that you know imagine a man standing on

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
the front line he's got his full body

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
armor on he's got his rifle he's got his

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
um night vision on he's he's watching

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
the front line he's watching for the

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
enemy for that frontal attack

98
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
now

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
while he's standing there he suddenly

100
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
finds himself on the ground

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
and then in the hospital and he asks the

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,959
doctor what happened

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,720
yeah i was ready i was armed up i was

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
geared up i was paying attention i was

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
looking for that attack and the doctor

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
said yeah but um in those rocks you were

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
hiding in there was a snake and he bit

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,799
you in a leg and you almost died

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
and so we have to really be aware of

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
these snakes and the rocks yeah so

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
troops they're massing on the borders

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
but the digital warfare is already

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
raging threat actors are infiltrating

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
targets now they're hiding they're

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,680
putting their digital snakes in the rock

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,239
waiting for that opportunity to be

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
called to action and what do these

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
digital snakes look like they look like

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
increased ransomware activity that you

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,358
see happening with russia china north

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
korea iran

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
you see upward trends in digital

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,840
blackmail fraud deep fakes in social

124
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,800
media tampering why because they need to

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
fund this war effort and they're going

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,000
to get money from wherever they can they

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,639
also need to discredit government

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,880
institutions and individuals so there's

129
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
an information operations piece of this

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
digital warfare so they're hacking

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
social media they're hacking media

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
outlets they're doing anything they can

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
to get in and hide those snakes in the

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,720
rocks now why is this important

135
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
well digital warfare

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,160
um it has global collateral damage

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,479
we all know the merck sharpen dome

138
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
um incident don't we from no from not

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
that yet yeah

140
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
this not picked yet uh incident in merc

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,199
sharpendome was caused by the digital

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,320
conflict of russia and ukraine

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
it was collateral damage in fact the

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
most costly cyber attack in history was

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,320
actually caused by collateral damage

146
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
from a digital warfare it was not a

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
direct attack on that company but

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
hundreds of companies and industries

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
were impacted by this and it's not just

150
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
the beginning we're going to see an

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
increase in collateral damage if we

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
don't take action

153
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,240
quickly decisively and also collectively

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
now something to keep in mind the us

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
intelligence

156
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
believes that russian

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
cyber criminals targeting the ukraine

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,120
can rapidly propagate

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
collateral damage

160
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,080
into industries like power and utilities

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
government transportation logistics

162
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
international organizations finance and

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
also media now not just propagating but

164
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
if there are sanctions placed against

165
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,759
them to prevent them from taking the

166
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
action they want they may very well

167
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,479
attack these sanctioning countries in

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
these industries so

169
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
um the collateral damage is an issue but

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
also the direct over attack is also an

171
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
initiative an issue to look at inside

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
the cyberspace

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,039
now that in and of itself is significant

174
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,400
but

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
that's not all happening the second

176
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
trend this e-revolution in logistics

177
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
automotive transportation this

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
proliferation of smart homes smart

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
cities intelligent enterprises and

180
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,840
digital ports

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,880
this plays a role yeah we have an

182
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,680
exponential increase

183
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
of technology devices what does that

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
mean that means increased attack surface

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
that means more rocks to hide those

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,080
digital snakes we are more connected and

187
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,400
more collaborative than ever before and

188
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,599
that's a

189
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
fantastic and fine thing but we are also

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,520
more vulnerable and more at risk than

191
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
ever before because of this

192
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
interconnected phenomenon that's

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
happening

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,840
now there's more snakes in the rocks and

195
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
there's more open pathways for

196
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,240
collateral damage to rapidly propagate

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
and even start claiming human life

198
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,160
think about it

199
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
trains buses fully automated power

200
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
plants fully automated they get hit by

201
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
this collateral damage you're not just

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
taking out industry and money you're

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,840
taking out human life now so we must

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,199
prepare now

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,560
that's not all

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
there's additional implications here

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
there's a race to 5g dominance happening

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
to support this now why is that

209
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,840
significant because that place increased

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
risk within the supply chains

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,560
you see what do i mean by that well

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
countries are racing to own the

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
infrastructure to own the 5g dominance

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,319
because whoever owns 5g

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,520
owns

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
business they own

217
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,199
the pathways to giant revenue um revenue

218
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
streams so think about this china

219
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,199
china owns a large percentage of

220
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,440
africa's infrastructure already china

221
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,319
heavily invests in underdeveloped third

222
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,840
world countries

223
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
now if you move your business and your

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
operations into africa you need to deal

225
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,599
with the complexities of being in africa

226
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,519
because it's a very complex environment

227
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
but geographically you're in africa but

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,360
digitally you're actually in china so

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
your cyber strategy has to have two

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
pieces to it how do i handle what's

231
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
happening to me kinetically in in the

232
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,160
real world in africa but also being

233
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,200
inside china digitally so our our

234
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
digital our cyber security strategies

235
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
have to have multi dimensions to them

236
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
because of this and because this is a

237
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,279
race people are buying components at

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
bulk and they're buying them cheap

239
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,200
who can i get it from how fast can i get

240
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
it from well who's checking those

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
components who's checking those devices

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
what payload is loaded in those devices

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
where is that snake in the rocks

244
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
fighting in our supply chain and our

245
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
infrastructure during this race

246
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
now if those two aren't enough

247
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
let's just add a global pandemic yeah so

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
the global pandemic leapfrogged us 10

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,760
years ahead of when we were ready to be

250
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
home office paradigms adoption

251
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,399
strategies every institution in the

252
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
world had to start embracing these and

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,399
the vast majority were not ready for it

254
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,480
many were ready many were prepared and

255
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
those are an example of people to

256
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,320
partner with to learn from but those who

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,120
weren't ready created gaps they created

258
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,160
holes within their their um

259
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
their cyber security strategy within

260
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,240
their protection layers and the threat

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
actors they saw it and they they

262
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,120
exploited this greatly ease of acts to

263
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,839
vulnerable homes and network systems and

264
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,120
what am i going to get there well i'm

265
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
going to get information about people

266
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
that i can blackmail them i can extort

267
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
them i can impersonate them so it opened

268
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
up the door

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
to um

270
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,880
unprecedented levels of exploitation and

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
that's going to continue to increase as

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
this phenomenon rolls forward

273
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
now this is not all doom and gloom i'm

274
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
talking about here right so

275
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
with any storm we have opportunity like

276
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
i mentioned in the beginning

277
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,399
so we have the chance to build global

278
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,480
strategic partnerships with economic

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
regulatory and trade leaders because

280
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,959
technology is not the only solution we

281
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
can help each other across countries

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,519
across

283
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,480
agencies across industries to really

284
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
weather this storm together to share

285
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
ideas to share innovation to collaborate

286
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
and not compete when it comes to

287
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,399
protecting ourselves

288
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,760
from these criminals and what's

289
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
happening in this storm

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
and these political and regulatory

291
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,519
allies i like to explain this circling

292
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,640
the wagons

293
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
a former brigade commander a very good

294
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,600
friend of mine

295
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
he used to always say hey when you

296
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
circle the wagons the guns point out not

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,040
in so we can't be shooting each other

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,399
competing against each other in the

299
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,000
cyber industry we need to partner with

300
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,440
each other to face that common enemy

301
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
another opportunity we have

302
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
is to engage

303
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
board members business leaders and

304
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
supply chain partners as risk owners

305
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,880
cyber is a hot topic cyber is a business

306
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
function it is not a function of

307
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
technology it is a function of business

308
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,560
directly related to quality and risk so

309
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
we can help businesses and governments

310
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
and agencies identify their crown jewels

311
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
their key assets

312
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,920
where to invest and prioritize their

313
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
investment how to help others because

314
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
you know these cyber criminals and

315
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,279
threat actors they move between

316
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
industries so something's happening in

317
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,519
one industry we can learn from it and

318
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,880
partner for the next industry and

319
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
prepare for what's coming in the tactics

320
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
they use

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
now making business and encouraging

322
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
business to own cyber and not technology

323
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,560
leaders to own cyber gives a much

324
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
different narrative

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
it helps unlock innovation it helps open

326
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
new markets it helps bring visibility

327
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,120
into risk that weren't known before so

328
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,440
that these new perspectives help us to

329
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,360
unlock new innovation and unlock new

330
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
markets in a safe in a prepared way

331
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
and this whole

332
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
e-revolution phenomenon i talked about

333
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,519
earlier it creates a need for certified

334
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,720
hardened and cyber resilient suppliers

335
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
that niche that need can be filled if we

336
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,839
partner together in the supply chain

337
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,959
industry

338
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,760
to think about how do we protect not our

339
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,040
customers

340
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
not our clients but those end consumers

341
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,120
those lives who depend on resilient and

342
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,440
hardened technologies and approaches and

343
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
this niche can be filled and it

344
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
generates fantastic opportunity within

345
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
the industries

346
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
and maybe finally um

347
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
our training initiatives you know we

348
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,880
train the office we train the employees

349
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
but do we chain train the families and

350
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
the children yeah so the families and

351
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
children those are our future employees

352
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
and future leaders you have huge stem

353
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
initiatives across um different

354
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
countries to really build up capacity

355
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
and capability in technology space let's

356
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,959
also help people understand the value of

357
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
cyber within these initiatives

358
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
working home have this very fuzzy

359
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,040
boundary so we can help people learn now

360
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
how to secure themselves how to secure

361
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,800
their children in their schools in their

362
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,279
daily lives and that propagates to

363
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,839
future leaders who understand this storm

364
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
and are prepared to weather it they're

365
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
not surprised by it

366
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
so really if we partner together to

367
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
weather the storm we open up new markets

368
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
we build alliances we invest in future

369
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079
leaders and we are ready not just to

370
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,639
weather the storm but to grow from the

371
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
storm to learn from it to innovate from

372
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,160
it

373
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,959
so if we are aware that the world is

374
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
changing and the storm is coming

375
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
if we understand there are snakes in the

376
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
rocks that we need to be be uh be

377
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,920
careful of and if we build the right

378
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,120
partnerships coalitions and investments

379
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,880
we can really bring cyber forward into a

380
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
business function that opens up a whole

381
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,160
world of possibilities and personally i

382
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
think the munich cyber security

383
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,560
conference is the ideal forum to build

384
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,720
these coalitions that we need to weather

385
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
this digital storm that's coming so i

386
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
encourage each of you everybody reach

387
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
out join working groups you've never

388
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
even thought of joining before build new

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,800
coalitions form alliances

390
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,519
not just within your industry but across

391
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
industries and across countries on a

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,920
global scale when you do this

393
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,079
you will certainly grow from it and so

394
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,600
will be together

395
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
what are your thoughts

396
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
fantastic mike this was a highly

397
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,399
interesting and would lead to so many

398
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,920
follow-on question

399
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
but i'll just focus on one uh given the

400
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
fact that you've been assisted yourself

401
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,399
and you're still advising

402
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
a lot of cios and sisters out there

403
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
um

404
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,199
there many times of course

405
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,680
there is this claim hey you know

406
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,639
cyber needs a seat at the board tape um

407
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,560
at the board table and at oh at the

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,639
board level and they really need to

409
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,279
understand it but i mean most businesses

410
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
um the ciso is not um at the board level

411
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,360
he might be reporting into the cfo or

412
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,880
ciso um yeah or cio

413
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
so i'm always wondering

414
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
what are your thoughts about that um is

415
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
has everybody not understood it or

416
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,600
should the ceso in fact not be

417
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,959
a level one

418
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,720
uh executive but rather you know it's

419
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,959
fine if he reports he or she reports

420
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,720
into a level one position

421
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,800
yeah so that's a great question alex um

422
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
and it's kind of a passionate topic of

423
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,160
mine uh the the csos of yesterday and

424
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
some of today aren't ready for a

425
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,759
boardroom seat

426
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,440
a lot of companies recruit technical

427
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,079
csos so a lot of companies still view

428
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,160
cyber and security

429
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,959
as a technology function and what needs

430
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,440
to happen is a growth in leadership

431
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,680
acumen business acumen leadership

432
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,079
capabilities the development of csos to

433
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:24,959
be

434
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
leaders of people leaders of

435
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,959
organizations understanding business

436
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,600
dynamics and business risk and when when

437
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
that phenomenon increases because it's

438
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
happening today you're getting many more

439
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
csos who are leaders from industry who

440
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,040
are um trained in certain business

441
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
aspects um and technology is their

442
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,040
secondary strength and when you have

443
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
csos of this nature they absolutely need

444
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
to be at that board room table sitting

445
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
there with a c at the board but not

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,480
owning cyber yeah so not how can um

447
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
you adopt what i give you a cyber no

448
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,399
more saying

449
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,440
you own cyber you own this risk

450
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
so how can i help you mitigate that risk

451
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,880
that you own because i'm here to help

452
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,079
you

453
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
mitigate that risk and grow your

454
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
business and to help you move into

455
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,480
industries that you want to explore and

456
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,160
grow in in a safe and manageable way so

457
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,919
i think as the dialogue shifts to a

458
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
risk-based conversation with business

459
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,439
leaders

460
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,120
you're going to see a natural evolution

461
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
of the csos into the boardroom but if

462
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,559
they're not prepared and trained for it

463
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
they're talking about digital um they're

464
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,320
talking about threat intelligence

465
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,440
they're talking about

466
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
malware hacks they're going to lose the

467
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,440
board members yeah it's got to be a

468
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
conversation in the language the board

469
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
understands and which resonates with

470
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,559
them which basically boils down to

471
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,480
ebit margin shareholder satisfaction and

472
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
consumer safety and quality yeah and

473
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
when you're able to have those

474
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,799
conversations the cso should definitely

475
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,640
be at the board but until he's ready

476
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,559
sitting with the cio the cfo is a great

477
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
opportunity to grow them and build them

478
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
towards that level hope that answers

479
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,760
your question

480
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,160
okay very interesting now a more

481
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
technically oriented one and that's my

482
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
final question for today and once again

483
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,200
thank you for for taking the time um

484
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,320
when you were

485
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,280
a ciso at merck

486
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
and maybe in prior positions what's your

487
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,039
position on um otit security i mean a

488
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
lot of these ot systems today are

489
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
isolated from the i.t

490
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
but there's of course this growing trend

491
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,600
as you

492
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,919
said yourself earlier um

493
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,360
in when we were talking about the

494
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,640
perfect storm

495
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
of connecting everything

496
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
so are you more in favor of

497
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,080
you know air gapping all these ot

498
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
systems or do you think it's inevitable

499
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
that everything needs to be connected

500
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
um and um it's actually possible with

501
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,840
the technology that is out there today

502
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,679
yeah so i'm a big fan of zero trust

503
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,520
networks and network segmentation and

504
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
but i'm also a big fan of risk-based

505
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,120
conversations and doing what makes sense

506
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
yeah so

507
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
i won't automatically say segregate

508
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
everything ot from everything i t

509
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
because it may not make sense the way

510
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
that particular business operates yeah

511
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
you've got to have this conversation

512
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
about the risk about the benefit

513
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,880
about the amount of revenue involved so

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,120
if it costs you

515
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
um

516
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
millions a day to shut it down and

517
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,480
upgrade it to mitigate a risk of a

518
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
couple of million for a year it's a bad

519
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
investment yeah so you've really got to

520
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
understand

521
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,960
um

522
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
what makes that company tick

523
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,679
yeah um what's important in terms of

524
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,080
confidentiality integrity and

525
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
availability availability the reason i

526
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
mentioned that so i had one of my

527
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
clients who's big in the generics market

528
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
right

529
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,679
and when i looked at their cyber

530
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,760
security strategy including how they

531
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,840
interacted with the shop floor they were

532
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,640
very heavy on confidentiality and i

533
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,919
asked them what kind of ip do you have

534
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,240
and they have virtually no ip

535
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,080
their business model was based on

536
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
availability they cannot afford as a

537
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
generic company they cannot afford to

538
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
have empty shelf space yeah so really

539
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,159
their key

540
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,440
um uh cyber element was availability at

541
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
the highest level so how do you keep

542
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
those what's their business continuity

543
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,280
plan what's their survivability plan how

544
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
do they keep those um stations and those

545
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
segments running in the production

546
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
because they can't afford empty shelf

547
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,280
space so it changes the strategy

548
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
completely and the dialogue about what

549
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
risk to address your cyber strategy and

550
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,679
that's where you figure out how to

551
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
handle the otit connectivity is based on

552
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
what threat factors and what kind of

553
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
risk factors you need to address for the

554
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
profitability of your business and your

555
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
organization

556
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
okay thank you
