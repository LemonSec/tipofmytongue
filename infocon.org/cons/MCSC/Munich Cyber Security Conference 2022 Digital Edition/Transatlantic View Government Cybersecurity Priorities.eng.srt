1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,200
welcome everyone let's start with the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
topic that's on everyone's mind the

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,559
looming threat of a russian invasion of

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,080
ukraine

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,320
russia has for years used cyber attacks

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
in support of its geopolitical ambitions

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
in ukraine and we've already seen cyber

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,039
play a role in the current crisis in

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
early january ukrainian government was

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
hit with a series of wiper attacks that

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,439
defaced government websites and wiped

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
out data on some government computers

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,760
they were widely suspected though not

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,320
officially attributed as being russian

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,960
let's start with you dimitri first

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
was this attack a prelude to more

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
aggressive russian cyber action

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,840
and how could cyber fit into a kinetic

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
conflict if russia ultimately decides to

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,879
launch an invasion

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
well first of all this was a fairly

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,280
basic attack that we saw happen just a

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
few weeks ago so i'm not sure that this

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
was a prelude to anything but i think

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,000
there are two

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,480
basic concepts that russia has potential

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
to execute here

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,840
one i think that they're going to have

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
an overwhelming uh preference to

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,600
actually shut down as many

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,760
communications within ukraine as

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
possible at the time that they actually

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
launched their ground invasion um the

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
reason is twofold they'll want to impact

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
command and control for ukrainian forces

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,720
for ukrainian government they want to

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
impact the ability of the ukrainian

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,439
government to communicate with its

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,560
population

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
when the war is ongoing

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
and they're going to have they're going

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
to want to make sure that as little

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,159
information as possible gets out of the

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,360
country

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
videos pictures

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
that people may be taking about what

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
russia is actually doing potentially any

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
information about civilian casualties

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
that that are taking place so i think

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
that their their preference may very

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
well be to try to shut off the internet

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,479
um they can do so fairly easily by

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
targeting about a dozen internet

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
exchange points most of which are

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,119
located within kiev and kharkiv and that

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,960
would basically shut off internet

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,520
communicate communications um to the

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,079
outside world from within ukraine

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
and um the other thing of course that

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
they're gonna do um is use their

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,959
extensive ew electronic warfare

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,200
capabilities to jam satellite

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
communications to jam uh radio waves um

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
uh prevent tv signals from from

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
transmitting cell phones i expect to be

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
shut off as well so i think that's going

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,760
to be their overwhelming preference if

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
they choose not to go that route they

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
can certainly use cyber in a tactical

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,000
way so one of the things that they can

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,640
do for example is do disruptive attacks

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,959
against key military objectives

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
military mobilization databases that the

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
ukrainians may use to determine how the

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
volunteers will be sent to the front and

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
and how to call up reserves they may go

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
after tv stations and newspapers to both

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
take them offline or potentially to even

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
put out misinformation

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,959
through those channels that will mislead

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
the ukrainian public about how the war

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,080
is truly going

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
and then you you will see some other

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
pressure campaigns on the ukrainian

85
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
population uh you may see this

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,760
information being distributed through

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,239
informal networks like whatsapp groups

88
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
uh you may see potentially uh impact on

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,800
emergency response

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,599
services like police and firefighters

91
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
and and ambulances

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
so a wide variety of things that they

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
could do if they decide to go down that

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
path

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,360
so yuck tell us a bit about how nato and

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
the international community are helping

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,040
ukraine shore up its cyber defenses in

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
order to be prepared for the sorts of

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
potential onslaught that dmitry just

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,040
laid out

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
yeah thank you well uh the clarification

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
i don't speak on behalf of nato the nato

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,879
cyber defense center of excellence is a

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
somewhat independent body uh but uh

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
i was i was in ukraine four weeks ago uh

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,120
20th and 21st of january a week after

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
they had discovered those attacks which

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
dmitry mentioned you know it turned out

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
it wasn't a serious cyber attack it was

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
rather i'd say information attacks at

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
that point they didn't know yet exactly

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
but they was they were digging to the

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,319
bottom of it

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
um what i saw there was really

115
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,720
encouraging especially compared to my

116
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
2010 experience in ukraine where 2010 i

117
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,879
was there

118
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,918
um right after yanukovych was elected

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
and there was apathy nobody really cared

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
about what was going on in politics

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,759
people were all ah

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,320
now this nation is together they are

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
united um

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
they know that they want to move

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
westward with with their future they

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
don't want to go back towards you know

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,199
embrace russia and the soviet union-like

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,680
regimes so uh

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,160
they they were focused there were four

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,919
different cyber security agencies and

131
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,360
different branches of governments that i

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
met with they were all coordinating with

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
each other there was no typical

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
you know

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,639
power struggle between the agencies uh

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,199
what is what what are we doing as a nato

137
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
ccdcoe uh we offer them

138
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
a broad array of options to choose from

139
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
from from training to participation in

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,240
our exercises conferences and we fully

141
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
understand that uh

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
they are a nice nation at war they might

143
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
not have time for everything they they

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
need to pick and choose what's most

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
beneficial for them uh so they can

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,039
benefit from

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
from it but i'm being selfish as well i

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
i want to learn from them i i think that

149
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,800
they are the most battle

150
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
scarred uh

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
nation now with the cyber experts for

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
last eight years they've been the

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
russian testing grounds of cyber weapons

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
so they they know what it's like to be

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
in the receiving end so i'd love to have

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
their experts over and telling telling

157
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
to our people what it's like

158
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
well rob of course the uh

159
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
potential for russian malicious russian

160
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
cyber activity in ukraine is not

161
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,560
necessarily just confined to ukraine uh

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
we know that in in an escalating

163
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
conflict the there might be cyber

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,880
activities directed against the west to

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
include perhaps the united states tell

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
us about how your agency how dhs is is

167
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
helping uh to ensure that u.s agencies

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
and critical infrastructure

169
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
are are hardened or protected against

170
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
any potential russians malicious cyber

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,160
activity and then maybe also what you

172
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
might be doing to help ukraine in that

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
regard

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
thanks ellen we've been warning for

175
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
months

176
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
uh publicly and and privately

177
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,319
that cyber attacks could be part of a

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,000
broad-based russian effort to

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
destabilize and invade ukraine and

180
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
there aren't any specific credible

181
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,759
threats to the u.s homeland right now

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,560
but we're of course mindful of the

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
potential for russia to

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,639
consider escalation

185
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,720
in ways that may impact others

186
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
uh beyond ukraine

187
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
and so we have been working uh here at

188
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,840
home

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
uh intensively

190
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
uh with industry with critical

191
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
infrastructure uh owners and operators

192
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
to go shields up

193
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
and we've been doing that

194
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,960
at the cyber security and infrastructure

195
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
security agency or cisa

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,400
here at the department of homeland

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
security we've been doing that

198
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,199
through an unprecedented number of

199
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
threat briefings guidances and alerts

200
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,880
to our industry partners and also to

201
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
industry regulators here

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,840
in the united states so that they can

203
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,479
work directly with their industries we

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
issued an alert together with the fbi

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,880
and the nsa on the russian threat and

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
specific tactics that we know

207
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,639
the russian government

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,360
to use um we're also

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
of course working closely with

210
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
international

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
partners

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
we're doing that of course we've been

213
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
offering uh support

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,520
to ukraine together with other

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
united states government agencies to

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
help ukraine harden its cyber defenses

217
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
we'll continue to do so in the days

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,160
ahead

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
that being said significant improvements

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
uh in uh in cyber defenses don't happen

221
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,039
in weeks uh or even months uh so we're

222
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,759
realistic about what we can achieve and

223
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,440
so we're also focused on ensuring that

224
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
we have incident response capacity

225
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,360
available to them

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,479
if needed

227
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
and i just want to add as well

228
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
that we have been working very closely

229
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
as an administration as a biden

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,199
administration and also

231
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,080
with

232
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
from the department of homeland security

233
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
uh with our allies and partners

234
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,160
including through nato uh deputy

235
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
national security adviser for cyber

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
security and newberger was recently uh

237
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
in warsaw meeting with eastern european

238
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,599
and baltic

239
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,880
nations to

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
show our commitment to

241
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
common uh cyber defense uh and uh we

242
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
work directly at the department of

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
homeland security to uh directly with

244
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
international assert partners

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
every day uh to share uh the latest

246
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
cyber threat information that we have so

247
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,279
we are

248
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
all hands on deck working with ukraine

249
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
working with other allies and partners

250
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,959
including through nato and preparing

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
here at home

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
thank you and of course ukraine is not a

253
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
nato member but deputy national security

254
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
adviser newberger made clear that

255
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,920
if there is a

256
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,600
destabilizing cyber attack on

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,040
any member really of the international

258
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,399
community

259
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,560
that nato and other members would be

260
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
prepared to call it out as a violation

261
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
of the norm you know sort of a u.n

262
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
endorsed norm of responsible behavior in

263
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
cyberspace

264
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
and

265
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
and and that also raises the issue

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
perhaps follow on cyber attacks against

267
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
nato members such as the united states

268
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
or other european western european

269
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
nations should the west essay impose

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
really severe economic sanctions on

271
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,839
russia

272
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
after an invasion what do you think

273
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
what kind of action might that trigger

274
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
from nato would that trigger the article

275
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,480
5 uh commitment to

276
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
to um you know an attack against one as

277
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
an attack against all what do you think

278
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,160
uh yak or dimitri

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
let me try to take a stab and dmitry

280
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
will help me out yeah nato has declared

281
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,440
that

282
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
cyber cyber domain is part of nato uh

283
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
collective defense as well

284
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
uh but it's uh specified in the whale

285
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
summit declaration that uh it is dealt

286
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
with on case-by-case basis by the north

287
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
atlantic committee um decided how they

288
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
will hand a particular attack so it

289
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
depends on the severity of attack or

290
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
their human casualties what's the

291
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,800
financial damage

292
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,079
etc

293
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,360
and um

294
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,640
very deliberately on purpose uh there

295
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,279
are no specific lines drawn that you

296
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,160
know three casualties 10 million dollars

297
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,959
damage that would only tempt you know

298
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,079
that the

299
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,480
opposition or the the adversary to test

300
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
your test your lines but if it's just

301
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
you know too casual what if it's just

302
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,200
you know 8 million uh damage so uh it is

303
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
vaguely defined uh if it's if it's

304
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
serious consequences then the north

305
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
atlantic committee will

306
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,959
uh debate and then decide how to how to

307
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,120
handle it uh or do you dimitri you know

308
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,399
one of the things i think most people

309
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,480
don't appreciate is the actual language

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
of article five so it certainly calls

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,279
for collective defense of nato members

312
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,760
and it calls on individual members to

313
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
help an attack party but to help them do

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
very specific things to help them to

315
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,959
restore and maintain the security of the

316
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
north atlantic area that nato is

317
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
responsible for so certainly when you're

318
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
talking about a kinetic invasion of a

319
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,720
country that means going to war and uh

320
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
using armed force to kick out the

321
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,800
invader in cyber it's less clear what

322
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
that actually may mean it may mean that

323
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,279
you're using defensive capabilities to

324
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,600
kick an adversary out of your network

325
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
and to restore the security of that

326
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
network um and and may not include any

327
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,120
offensive retaliation whatsoever it may

328
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
may do so if if um

329
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,519
uh the the parties agree that that's

330
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
what it takes to actually restore the

331
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
security but it doesn't have to so um

332
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,079
you know what you may very well see is

333
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
the nato members preferring not to

334
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,000
escalate the situation with russia would

335
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
it would engage in in purely defensive

336
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
tactics to shore up security to do

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
incident response and to remediate

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
damage uh from from any attacks that

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,880
they may have that that may take place

340
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,079
let's

341
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
turn to another

342
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
major cyber

343
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
aware a cyber concern uh

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,639
on people's minds in the u.s and

345
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,279
internationally and that is ransomware

346
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
it remains a top economic and a national

347
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,639
security threat and members of congress

348
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
the biden administration and u.s law

349
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,639
enforcement agencies have said that

350
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,680
combating ransomware attacks remain a

351
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
top priority how

352
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
tanya is the fbi approaching the

353
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
ransomware threat and what is it doing

354
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,000
with its international partners to

355
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,760
coordinate on the set of issues

356
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
if there's one thing that the fbi knows

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
how to do it's to work with domestic and

358
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,079
international law enforcement partners

359
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
to take down

360
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
criminal enterprises and that includes

361
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,560
cyber criminal enterprises so as we've

362
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,600
been

363
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,320
working ransomware over years we've

364
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
built relationships not only here

365
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,959
domestically with organizations like the

366
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
us secret service but also

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
internationally with europol and

368
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
eurojust and many

369
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,760
european law enforcement partners

370
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,959
to look at these entities and see where

371
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,440
we can conduct joint coordinated

372
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
disruptions

373
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
that will not only have short-term

374
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
impacts but really the type of

375
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
longer-term

376
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,760
reduction

377
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
in ransomware that we're all looking to

378
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,800
achieve and when we look at those

379
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,320
organizations and how we affect those

380
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
types of disruptions we're really

381
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,959
looking at three areas the actors who

382
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,639
are behind the tax

383
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,480
which may include the developers of the

384
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,360
ransomware itself as well as the

385
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,279
affiliates in the organization who

386
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,199
actually conduct the attacks the

387
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,440
infrastructure that they use to carry

388
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
out that activity and the money

389
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
and that last part of course is

390
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
especially important

391
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
because this is a profit driven

392
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,720
enterprise and so the more that

393
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,800
criminals see that ransomware is

394
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,399
profitable the more they'll be

395
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,560
incentivized and encouraged to conduct

396
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
these attacks

397
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,399
i think especially joining with our

398
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,680
european

399
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,920
partners over the past year

400
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
we've had some notable successes not

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,279
only in

402
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
infrastructure takedowns but also

403
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,279
arresting and extraditing some of the

404
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,760
criminals behind this activity

405
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
as well as some notable virtual currency

406
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,519
seizures

407
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
a lot of that is enabled by our network

408
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
not only of legal attaches stationed

409
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
around the world but

410
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
attendees here may be less familiar with

411
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,320
the fact that we have assistant legal

412
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
attaches

413
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,480
specifically focused on cyber

414
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
investigations also stationed throughout

415
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
the world

416
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,040
mainly centered in europe

417
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
those have been very helpful

418
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,839
in our support to ukraine

419
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
during this current period and in the

420
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
past as well helping to investigate

421
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,760
malicious cyber attacks against their

422
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,519
critical infrastructure and they're

423
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,120
really a linchpin

424
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
in how we work with our european

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,639
partners against ransomware groups as

426
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
well

427
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,279
you mentioned the money as a key prong

428
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
how are the gaps in the international

429
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,720
anti-money laundering regime affecting

430
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
your ability to combat ransomware i'd

431
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,880
like to hear from you and then anyone

432
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
else who's who's focused on that issue

433
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
sure i'll start so where as we look at

434
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
the the financial sector here in the

435
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
united states um one of the uh parts of

436
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,880
the regulatory framework that really

437
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,519
assists law enforcement

438
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,160
excuse me are regulations having to do

439
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,079
with know your customer or know your

440
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,440
client

441
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
information that

442
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,079
financial sector entities are required

443
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
to ask of their customers to help combat

444
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,320
financial fraud money laundering etc

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
so domestically we have great

446
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
partnerships not only with the

447
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
kind of traditional financial sector uh

448
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
but also with the growing number of

449
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
virtual asset providers or virtual

450
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,639
currency uh exchanges um who are growing

451
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,480
in this space but internationally

452
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
that kind of structure and framework is

453
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,720
not consistent

454
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
each country has their own requirements

455
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
that exchanges have to deal with

456
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,320
sometimes foreign exchanges want to be

457
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
cooperative and responsive

458
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
to law enforcement requests for

459
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,519
information

460
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,120
but because they don't have that

461
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,279
existing framework

462
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
that provides consistency in the types

463
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
of information that they're collecting

464
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,599
about their customers they may not even

465
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,240
have the information on hand to provide

466
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
to law enforcement even if they do want

467
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
to be cooperative and then of course

468
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,119
there would be the the category of of

469
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,799
companies um

470
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
and countries that may not have an

471
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
interest in being cooperative with law

472
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
enforcement in that way

473
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,880
so i know that international

474
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
standardization would greatly help

475
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,679
efforts in this space and i believe

476
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,600
there is an international entity the

477
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,160
financial action task force that's

478
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
working towards that goal

479
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
so are many of the bad guys actually

480
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
going to some of these exchanges that

481
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960
don't uh cooperate or or don't have

482
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
you know clear rules and guidelines

483
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
about knowing your customer in order to

484
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,960
you know

485
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
launder their money and get their cash

486
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
proceeds out

487
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
is that one of the problems

488
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,960
um i think we can expect that you know

489
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
cyber criminals in particular are savvy

490
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
in terms of how and where they conduct

491
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,679
their activity

492
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
ellen if if i can jump in here

493
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
cryptocurrency is such a critical

494
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
component of this not just the

495
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,760
ransomware it's really the oxygen the

496
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,480
fuels the ransomware epidemic because of

497
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,840
the ability of these criminals to

498
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
receive ransoms anonymously

499
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
or suited anonymously and and get

500
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
literally tens of millions of dollars in

501
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
some of these cases but also it's

502
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,840
fueling so much of other cyber malicious

503
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
activity um

504
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
you certainly have drug trafficking and

505
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
tax evasion other things are taking

506
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
place because of cryptocurrency but you

507
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,600
also have cryptocurrency being used to

508
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,080
purchase infrastructure in an anonymous

509
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
fashion in fact you have seen the

510
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,760
russian gru russian military

511
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,240
intelligence use bitcoins to purchase

512
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,880
infrastructure that they had used um to

513
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
uh infiltrate um um

514
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,679
elements of of uh our election

515
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,559
infrastructure in the past and attacked

516
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,039
the dnc in 2016 a story that you wrote

517
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,679
about ellen back then so it is really

518
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,320
really important as tanya has said to

519
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,520
enforce kyc and aml anti-money

520
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,240
laundering rules across the board

521
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
globally not just in the united states

522
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
where that's already taking place but

523
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
everywhere else on the planet and one of

524
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,520
the things that we've at silverado

525
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
called upon the us government and

526
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
particularly congress to consider

527
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,400
is expanding ofx authorities and and

528
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,520
responsibilities to start sanctioning

529
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
exchanges not just if you've um seen

530
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
them uh engaging with criminal groups

531
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,039
and and and facilitating money

532
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
laundering but also if they're not

533
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
complying with law enforcement demands

534
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
such as those from the fbi if they're

535
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
not doing kyc and aml i think that will

536
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,039
have a chilling effect on the criminal

537
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
ecosystem and particularly these

538
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
exchanges that may not be

539
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
will willfully

540
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
enabling these crimes but maybe doing so

541
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
because it's cheap for them not to

542
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,520
perform these compliance checks the us

543
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
government has enormous capacity here

544
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,000
and cutting off these exchanges from the

545
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
global financial system would literally

546
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,480
 them as we've seen in the cases

547
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
of chad x and suex that the u.s

548
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,280
government sanctioned back in october

549
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
but could that actually just drive these

550
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,720
criminals underground and have them use

551
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
money mules or other forms of um you

552
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,600
know ways to to to get their money

553
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,039
what do you think it certainly won't

554
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,799
solve everything but at the end of the

555
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,559
day you need those exchanges if you're

556
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,320
moving tens of millions of dollars

557
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,919
hundreds of millions of dollars as the

558
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,000
case with some of these uh criminal

559
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
organizations so um these exchanges

560
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,039
serve a critical function to facilitate

561
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
these forms of cyber crime and if you

562
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,880
can get them to clean up their act it

563
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,400
will make it much much harder not

564
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,919
impossible but much much harder for

565
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
these criminals to operate

566
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
okay

567
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,960
rob dhs is also on the front lines of

568
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
the anti-ransomware fight in the u.s

569
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
what's your analysis of the current

570
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
state of the us's resilience against

571
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,440
ransomware attacks

572
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
and what are your department's near and

573
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,840
long-term priorities on ransomware

574
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,000
we've known for a long time that

575
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,320
ransomware can have a devastating impact

576
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,799
on a victim organization i think what we

577
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,799
saw with uh what happened with colonial

578
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,919
pipeline

579
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,120
uh in may was that um you can also have

580
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,840
devastating cascading impacts physical

581
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,799
world impacts um for example in that uh

582
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,520
case where you saw half the fuel supply

583
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,679
to the united states east coast uh

584
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
disrupted and so there's just no

585
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
question that ransomware is a national

586
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
security issue in addition to

587
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
a criminal issue uh one of the very

588
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,919
first actions that uh secretary of

589
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,679
homeland security alejandra mayorkas

590
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,360
took when he took office

591
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
was to order a 60-day ransomware sprint

592
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
at the department even before colonial

593
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
hit

594
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
to

595
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,480
enhance our ability to work with

596
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
critical infrastructure and operators in

597
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,200
particular

598
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
to build up their defenses

599
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
against ransomware and so we have set up

600
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,480
a one-stop shop website of ransomware

601
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
resources we've done that together with

602
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,880
the fbi um we

603
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
issued issued

604
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,320
all manner of alerts guidances and best

605
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,440
practices um to industry uh that they

606
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
can pick up on and so that's a very

607
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
significant part

608
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,559
of our work

609
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
we also as an administration

610
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
are more directly attacking uh at the

611
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,480
problem to try to get it from all angles

612
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,640
um tanya spoke to a lot of that critical

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
work that the fbi is doing we're also

614
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
sanctioning cryptocurrency

615
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,919
uh exchanges um through through our

616
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,280
diplomatic

617
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,840
outreach to allies um and also our

618
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
direct discussions uh with the russian

619
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
and other governments um we are taking

620
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,440
this problem on uh from all angles and

621
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,679
it's among our very highest cyber

622
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,919
security priorities i'll also say we're

623
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,000
working very closely with congress to

624
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
try to get incident reporting

625
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
legislation

626
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
enacted that is legislation that would

627
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
require

628
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
critical infrastructure companies to

629
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,840
report serious uh cyber security instant

630
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,200
in uh incidents uh to sisa uh and

631
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,840
including uh ransomware incidents uh we

632
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,799
have to know uh about what is happening

633
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,600
uh to be able uh to appropriately defend

634
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,120
this country so that is our top

635
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
legislative priority with our congress

636
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,640
this year

637
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
yuck how is europe looking at the

638
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
ransomware

639
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
issue how much of a problem is it for

640
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
you what are you doing about it

641
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,679
um

642
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,400
well

643
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
our center has been kind of focusing on

644
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
national security the bigger picture and

645
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
we've been dealing with ransomware as

646
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,440
the criminal thing that we don't really

647
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,760
look into but it's it's becoming more

648
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
and more a security issue it's it's very

649
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
hard to draw a line

650
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
where is it the criminal gang and where

651
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
is the criminal gang on behalf of a

652
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,559
government or government themselves uh

653
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,039
doing it and it's just scaling it up so

654
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,640
uh it is it is a serious threat um

655
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,159
i i

656
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,200
europe has compared to united states

657
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
well we will need politicians here

658
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,799
instead of me you know so i don't i

659
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,760
don't think i'm going to have a

660
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
satisfactory answer here

661
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,880
but i want to i to pose a theory and a

662
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,039
question to to the rest of the panelists

663
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,120
regarding money laundering and crypto

664
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,000
you know

665
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,440
in the 90s

666
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
world had somewhat given up on tackling

667
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,559
money laundering dirty money uh yes

668
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,000
governments made efforts but they

669
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,039
weren't real efforts the 911 changed

670
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
everything just trying to cut down

671
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
terrorist funding the anti-money

672
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
laundering became very big and

673
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,760
impressive effort

674
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
what would be now the

675
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,159
event that would trigger the similar

676
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,240
governmental effort and

677
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
unanimous effort uh in the western world

678
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,440
against the cryptocurrencies and their

679
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,279
their use in not against the

680
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,640
cryptocurrency but the use of

681
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,600
cryptocurrency um in in funding crime

682
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
terrorism uh malicious activities that's

683
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
a great question uh throw it open

684
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
you know i i actually don't think it's

685
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
gonna be that hard it will take some

686
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,559
time but the reality is that the us

687
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
government has achieved unprecedented

688
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,120
success in the last 20 years getting

689
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,679
every nation on the planet to

690
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
accept that money laundering is is a

691
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
problem and that they all need to fight

692
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
it and that kyc and ml rules have to

693
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,559
apply broadly to their financial sectors

694
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,400
so we have seen countries like

695
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,559
switzerland and the cayman islands and

696
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
these traditional sort of offshore tax

697
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,360
havens and money laundering havens in

698
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,320
some cases uh really disappear because

699
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,559
of the pressure of the us government um

700
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,400
and and the threat of getting um these

701
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
organizations cut off from the global

702
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
financial systems really going into

703
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
effect so now that you've established

704
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
that baseline where everyone agrees that

705
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,600
we all need to fight money laundering um

706
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,919
and other forms of financial crimes it

707
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,080
is really all about extending that from

708
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,320
the traditional financial system into

709
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,679
this new uh web 3 d5

710
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,360
crypto ecosystem um that has emerged so

711
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
i don't think it's actually going to be

712
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
that difficult to get countries to

713
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,039
extend their rules and regulations in

714
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,200
such a formal fashion and obviously the

715
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,880
white house and the administration are

716
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
pushing hard on that um the recent

717
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,840
summit that they had in october with 30

718
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,159
nations on ransomware had a critical

719
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
component a focus on on on this very

720
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
issue and and how to deal with the

721
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,159
problem of cryptocurrency so it will

722
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,320
take time but i expect that this will be

723
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
solved in the coming years

724
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,679
what do you think tanya

725
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,760
how do you see the um the international

726
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
community responding to your all's

727
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,480
efforts to get them to adopt

728
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,919
standard rules

729
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,760
i think dimitri covered it well i would

730
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,720
certainly hope that um we're not waiting

731
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
for some sort of catalyst in the form of

732
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,240
a catastrophic incident to be what what

733
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
moves us to make significant progress in

734
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,279
this area i'd like to think that we've

735
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,320
learned uh some lessons from the 9 11

736
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,840
example that yak provided in that regard

737
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,240
um i also think we have to be realistic

738
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,799
about you know the world that we inhabit

739
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,640
today in terms of um cryptocurrency and

740
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
how money flows and you know sometimes

741
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,279
we see an extreme um recommendations in

742
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,600
terms of let's outlaw virtual currency

743
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
or something like that i think we need

744
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,320
to you know kind of reject unrealistic

745
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,279
suggestions on the margins and focus on

746
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,679
how do we improve kind of the standards

747
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,919
and the frameworks uh for the world

748
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,559
we're in today and also anticipate where

749
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,520
all this is headed going forward

750
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,640
so

751
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,039
we really haven't seen a

752
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,520
another you know massive zorova or

753
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
high-profile attack against critical

754
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,720
infrastructure such as the one against

755
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,440
colonial pipeline or even jb as the meat

756
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
processing

757
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,559
company

758
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,919
uh

759
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,480
and and rob so do you think that the

760
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
efforts at u.s russia dialogue over

761
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,120
getting russia to try to rein in these

762
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
uh criminal ransomware actors is having

763
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,159
some impact do you think it's the fbi's

764
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,080
actions on uh

765
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,039
you know disruptions and and squeezing

766
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
the actors in other ways is having some

767
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,760
what what do you see as the trend a and

768
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,679
b what do you think is behind it

769
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,279
so ellen it it's true uh that we have

770
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,559
not seen an incident of that magnitude

771
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,480
uh in some time it's also true that

772
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
we've seen reports of russian

773
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
authorities uh disrupting or taking into

774
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,640
custody uh certain ransomware actors um

775
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
but i think we

776
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
still need to watch uh for actions and

777
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
results

778
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
uh rather than words um

779
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,039
uh ransomware remains at unacceptable

780
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,320
levels

781
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
we've been

782
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,559
clear

783
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
with the russian government

784
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,480
um that we expect action

785
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
uh and that if they will not take uh

786
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,039
action we will take action

787
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,679
uh to disrupt those that would target us

788
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
uh with ransomware and so our work uh

789
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,919
absolutely continues

790
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,240
you know if i could add ellen uh even

791
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
though we have not seen a colonial type

792
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,640
of attack here in the united states uh

793
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,399
we have seen them in recent weeks in

794
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,559
europe there's been a german oil storage

795
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,279
company whose operations were disrupted

796
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,520
because of a cyber attack uh a ransom

797
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,799
were attacked there were a couple of

798
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,640
belgian energy companies that were hit

799
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,200
as well so we seem to have had the

800
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
significant amount of ransomware

801
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
appearing in europe

802
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
in the last few weeks particularly

803
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
targeting their energy sector

804
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,520
dimitri you follow this area very

805
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,279
closely do you think that the recent

806
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
actions to arrest some of these uh

807
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,080
criminal actors in russia

808
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
you know portends things to come or do

809
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
you think

810
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,320
those were sort of just gestures empty

811
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
gestures or one-offs by russian

812
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
government the russian government do you

813
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
really think we're making forward

814
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
progress or not here

815
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
yeah you know ellen i really called this

816
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,279
action ransomware diplomacy russia's

817
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,480
newly found cooperation on ransomware

818
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
is not an act it's not an accident that

819
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,880
is taking place in the midst of these uh

820
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,120
significant tensions over a potential

821
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,200
invasion of ukraine and the threat of

822
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,799
severe sanctions against the russian

823
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,840
economy from the west as a result so i

824
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
think they're sending a signal to us

825
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
that they can indeed be very helpful on

826
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
investigation of these criminal actors

827
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,679
and arresting them something that they

828
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,440
have not done in the past

829
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,279
but they will not do so

830
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,600
obviously if the relations disintegrate

831
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,120
over ukraine and i do think that uh if

832
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
if there are severe sanctions that we

833
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,960
impose on russia in the coming weeks

834
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
we may very well see a reversal where

835
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,640
some of these individuals would be

836
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,399
released and that would send an

837
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,120
unmistakable even unspoken

838
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,640
message to the

839
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,960
russian cybercrime ecosystem that it's

840
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,840
open season on western organizations

841
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,279
what do you think rob

842
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,640
i think we're prepared for all

843
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,720
contingencies um uh it's no uh secret

844
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
that russia has

845
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,120
proven itself willing to use

846
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,600
uh cyber means to achieve its broader

847
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
geopolitical

848
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
objectives we've seen that in ukraine um

849
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,960
with

850
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,159
what it did in the 2015 time frames with

851
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,720
disruptions to the energy grid there

852
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
and otherwise and so

853
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,679
we're preparing uh for all all scenarios

854
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,279
uh we're ready for it

855
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,320
um and uh and uh and that's why we're

856
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
working very closely with industry with

857
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,039
other government agencies to protect our

858
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,480
federal networks um from being targeted

859
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,640
uh and um i think uh

860
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,240
that's that's where our focus is right

861
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
now is on preparedness

862
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,919
and ellen if i could add in there i

863
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,919
would just like to recommend to those

864
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,480
watching a joint cyber security advisory

865
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,279
that

866
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
u.s government agencies like the fbi and

867
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,559
cisa recently published along with our

868
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,480
cyber counterparts in the uk and

869
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,960
australia looking at ransomware trends

870
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,799
not only in the u.s

871
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,200
but across all of our countries

872
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,120
noting some of the changes over the last

873
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,240
year

874
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
including you know particularly in the

875
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,399
u.s a move from

876
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,039
what we refer to as big game hunting

877
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,159
that focus on kind of high profile

878
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,799
victims to more of the the mid and

879
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,279
small-sized uh victims of the attacks

880
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,000
so in the event of escalating conflict

881
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,039
in europe in ukraine how concerned

882
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,480
should we be about a really devastating

883
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,919
and catastrophic uh use of cyber either

884
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,080
against ukraine or against the west

885
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,480
dimitri talk a little bit about the role

886
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,240
of cyber in the ukraine

887
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,360
you on me please

888
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,840
sorry about that um first of all i don't

889
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,039
believe that russia will be the first

890
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,200
one to escalate in cyberspace against

891
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
the west i think if we do see major

892
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
attacks against western entities it will

893
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,760
be because of severe sanctions that will

894
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,320
put in place on russian economy as a

895
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,240
result of invasion um so they're going

896
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,559
to wait and see um and

897
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,919
the signals that they've been standing

898
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,080
over the last few months have been very

899
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
clear they don't want to escalate

900
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,720
vis-a-vis the west they view ukraine as

901
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,120
their local problem and they are very

902
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,279
allergic to our

903
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,080
defense of ukraine however if those

904
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,240
sanctions do take a place i think you

905
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
can absolutely expect a rise in

906
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,880
ransomware attacks against

907
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,720
u.s institutions against european

908
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
institutions

909
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,919
you may very well see

910
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,000
even russian state actors engaged in

911
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,320
some cyber disruption but i think it's

912
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
probably less likely russia has enormous

913
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,799
leverage in the economic sphere even

914
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,360
outside of cyber to respond

915
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,960
through export control measures for

916
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,120
example on critical materials like

917
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,880
aluminum and uranium and titanium and

918
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,480
palladium and many other things that

919
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
that will do a lot to hurt

920
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
the us economy and the global economy

921
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,679
and rise and

922
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,000
cause rise of inflation so i don't think

923
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,719
that

924
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,679
cyber from state actors is going to be

925
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,719
the first

926
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,560
or the preferred mechanism from respon

927
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,159
for response but certainly things

928
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,159
continue to escalate everything is on

929
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,918
the table

930
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,520
okay

931
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
first time in my life i want to try to

932
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,480
disagree slightly with dmitry

933
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,599
you know

934
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,119
mr putin said in 2007 munich security

935
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,760
conference that he he's sick and tired

936
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,839
of their existing security architecture

937
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,280
and he wants to change that and he's

938
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,040
still at it so i don't think

939
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,560
uh ukraine is his goal

940
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,800
hopefully to get us the allies to fight

941
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,918
amongst

942
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,680
each other

943
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
and disrupt our unity

944
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,119
so

945
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,640
uh

946
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,079
cyber is a really really good way

947
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,800
to do that i can't right now come up

948
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
with a you know example how to get

949
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,160
nations to disagree on something but

950
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
a strong cyber attack against an ally

951
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,320
who

952
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,800
either is on russian border uh or is

953
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
very far away from russian border and

954
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
usually doesn't see russia as a threat

955
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
um

956
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,240
off of a specific character uh

957
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,800
and see how nations disagree on on the

958
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,440
response um and then go from there that

959
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,480
could be

960
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
that could be a way to drop the seed of

961
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,119
disagreement amongst us the nato allies

962
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,000
okay

963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,320
uh in in the minutes we have left i

964
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
wanted to ask a few of you um starting

965
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,160
with dimitri of your top cyber security

966
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
policy priorities for the coming year

967
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,880
um and in your mind which of these is

968
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,599
the most pressing and does the mounting

969
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
tension between russian ukraine change

970
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,560
your priorities at all

971
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,240
well as we've talked about i think the

972
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,880
cryptocurrency actions um and

973
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,640
particularly the the use of sanction

974
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
threat against exchanges that do not do

975
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,200
kyc and ml is a really important one i

976
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,480
think there is more that the united

977
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,400
states can do to reorganize its

978
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,240
government better

979
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,880
for defense particularly given csun more

980
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
authorities to um

981
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,800
to do defense broadly across civilian

982
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
federal government and obviously as rob

983
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
and tanya have mentioned

984
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,799
this

985
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,599
incident reporting legislation

986
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,079
that's on the hill right now that

987
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,160
hopefully will pass this sheer to enable

988
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,480
reporting to the government and sharing

989
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
across broader um

990
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,800
us government including the fbi is

991
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,079
really really important to give us a

992
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,520
situational awareness picture what's

993
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,280
going on and i do want to make a quick

994
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,480
plug for

995
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
something that has just happened that i

996
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,960
think is really a game-changing tool and

997
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
want to complement the uh department of

998
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,400
homeland security and and the

999
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,240
administration for setting this up but

1000
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,560
the cyber safety review board um that

1001
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,880
rob silvers chairs and i'm honored to be

1002
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
part of and and um tanya's boss brian

1003
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,680
vorden is a part of as well i think is

1004
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,320
really a critical tool to review

1005
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,119
um

1006
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,200
cyber incidents that have taken place

1007
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,280
and and determine holistically how we

1008
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,839
can do better as a nation as a world in

1009
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,000
responding to future cyber incidents

1010
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,839
learning from past mistakes is really

1011
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,599
really critical and we've just not been

1012
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,720
doing a good job in cyber so far

1013
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
great

1014
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,800
uh

1015
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,160
tanya or rob

1016
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,760
i think rob you mentioned earlier some

1017
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,000
of your top priorities right including

1018
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,880
incident response reporting

1019
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,680
how about you jack jack

1020
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,400
yeah um hard to pick the top top number

1021
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,839
one thing

1022
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,640
yeah one or two okay good we

1023
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,880
nato series coe is amongst other things

1024
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,280
the training organization and i i feel

1025
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
that uh

1026
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,000
the the better cyber hygiene is in the

1027
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,880
broadest amongst the masses of people of

1028
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,119
internet users the harder it is for the

1029
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,680
cyber criminals and cyber attackers

1030
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,240
so so training people training everybody

1031
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,800
uh from you know common user to expert

1032
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,680
level is what we'll keep on doing

1033
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,240
our exercises train the top cyber

1034
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,760
defenders

1035
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,119
and cyber offense nato nato has come a

1036
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,960
long

1037
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,440
we we are now you know not allergic to

1038
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,760
the talk of nato nations

1039
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,640
exercising cyber cyber offense

1040
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,160
it is it is

1041
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,960
it is a tool that needs to be used um

1042
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,040
and we need to come to the terms that in

1043
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,280
accordance with international law

1044
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,560
we need to be

1045
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,200
ready and and emotionally okay with

1046
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,839
using cyber offensive called upon what

1047
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,520
do you mean by that

1048
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
show give me an explanation example

1049
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,200
well um you know i'll go back to my

1050
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,760
previous job as an estonian air chief i

1051
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,000
i had a talk with a fellow air chief

1052
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,079
from a large nato nation and he told me

1053
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,040
that

1054
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
um in the theater dropping a

1055
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,040
laser-guided bomb on a

1056
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,839
confirmed isis server room is a decision

1057
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,000
delegated down to a you know major or

1058
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
lieutenant kernel level very low

1059
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,359
tactical

1060
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,280
doing the same with offensive cyber

1061
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
would be you know high political level

1062
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,200
decision uh

1063
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
it's not going to be come to the equal

1064
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,320
level in in the next year year or two

1065
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
but but at least it should be down to

1066
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,480
the operational commander the general

1067
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,760
officer in charge of the overall

1068
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
operation should be able to say that i'm

1069
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,640
going to use cyber uh that's that's how

1070
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,119
comfortable we should we should get

1071
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
in in the military realm right you're

1072
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,800
talking exactly yeah yeah

1073
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
okay it's interesting

1074
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
um

1075
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,760
and we have only a couple of minutes

1076
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
left i wanted to just

1077
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,119
ask you all about something very

1078
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,200
interesting that uh

1079
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,960
i've seen the us government do in the

1080
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,160
last few weeks really this is cyber

1081
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
related it's ukraine related it's

1082
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,320
russia's use of uh

1083
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,119
you know the cyber realm to

1084
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,160
conduct its uh its influence operations

1085
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,359
its information warfare and

1086
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,200
disinformation campaigns and the us

1087
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,839
government has been aggressively

1088
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,119
exposing

1089
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,160
these operations to often declassifying

1090
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,079
information and intelligence in order to

1091
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,560
make public what it's seeing

1092
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,119
about russian plots like you know false

1093
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,960
flag uh operations to say s stage of a

1094
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,599
fake explosion that takes

1095
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,760
uh casualties among ethnic russians and

1096
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,839
pinning the blame on ukraine in order to

1097
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,720
create a false pretext for an invasion

1098
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,480
uh how

1099
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,400
you know how unprecedented is that level

1100
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,720
of um sort of counter information

1101
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,280
warfare by western government what do

1102
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,640
you think of it

1103
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,280
um how effective is it

1104
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,760
you know i i it's been remarkable to

1105
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,079
watch this over the last few weeks ellen

1106
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,000
because um it's not just happening of

1107
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
course in cyber they're publicizing all

1108
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
sorts of intelligence about russian

1109
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,560
troop buildup about decision making uh

1110
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,240
that's taking place in the kremlin with

1111
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
regards to potential invasion and um i

1112
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,240
really have to commend the

1113
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,640
administration because they are clearly

1114
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,720
uh deciding to

1115
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,440
um um uh you know um to go all in on

1116
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,000
their attempt to stop this war and

1117
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,319
potentially change russia's calculus by

1118
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,640
letting them know just how much we know

1119
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,800
about what they're trying to do unclear

1120
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
if that will actually

1121
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,960
make a difference for putin but it's

1122
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,520
certainly worth a try and it certainly

1123
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,680
is remarkable to watch the the level of

1124
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,599
intelligence that we are actually able

1125
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,319
to

1126
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,640
assemble on on russia's intentions on

1127
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,119
russia's capabilities across the board

1128
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,839
in this upcoming

1129
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,240
conflict yuck

1130
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,200
i agree with dmitry we're we're

1131
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,760
learning that russia and accepting that

1132
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
russia in the past decade has been

1133
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,440
better than us and now we the west need

1134
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,560
you need to

1135
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,800
catch up and then to do information

1136
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,960
warfare as good as they are

1137
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,079
okay

1138
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:06,960
uh

1139
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,280
rob or tanya do you have any uh thoughts

1140
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,880
on on the

1141
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
hunter information

1142
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,880
uh disinformation campaign the us is

1143
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
carrying out

1144
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,280
yes

1145
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,920
uh information manipulation is a is an

1146
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,880
early chapter in russia's conflict

1147
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,920
playbook

1148
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,560
uh and we're not going to cede the

1149
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,240
information environment

1150
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
to russia in areas where

1151
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
it matters to us and i think what you've

1152
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,760
seen is a frankly an unprecedented

1153
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
um campaign by this administration

1154
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
to correct the record and make sure that

1155
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,160
information

1156
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
accurate information is out there uh to

1157
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,520
correct uh the misinformation uh that

1158
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,000
russia spews out uh in pursuit of its

1159
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,560
objectives and uh you've seen that in

1160
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,680
terms of the

1161
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,319
um uh releases of

1162
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,880
russia's plans and intentions i think

1163
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,480
you've also seen it with some terrific

1164
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
work that our state department has done

1165
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,319
uh by issuing a rumor control website to

1166
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,839
counter some of the

1167
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,400
more flagrant russian propaganda as to

1168
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
who is really responsible for the

1169
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,599
escalating situation uh in ukraine i

1170
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,760
think you can expect to see uh all of

1171
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
that continue

1172
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,680
uh and just uh rev up or committed to

1173
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,040
that line of effort as an administration

1174
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,359
well that's all the time we have for our

1175
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,920
panel i want to thank the munich cyber

1176
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,760
security conference for giving us this

1177
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,000
platform to share our thoughts and to

1178
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,560
thank you all for watching

1179
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,839
thanks again everyone
