1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,799
i love movies and one of my all-time

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,639
favorites is the graduate which won the

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,840
academy award for best director in 1968.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,920
in a classic scene from the movie recent

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,160
college grad benjamin braddock played by

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
dustin hoffman is pulled aside by his

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
father's business partner who tells him

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
with mystical intensity

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,439
just one word

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,359
plastics

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,439
i lead sissa america's cyber defense

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
agency and i've got one word for you

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,120
and it's not cloud or visibility or

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,000
analytics or zero trust or even

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
ransomware

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
it's culture

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
let me explain

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,280
i served in iraq in 2007 during the

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
surge when violence was at an all-time

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
high i was deployed there from the

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
national security agency to lead our

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
intelligence forces on the ground and my

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
team and i were asked to operationalize

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,760
a new high-tech capability that would

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
bring together all of the collection and

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,399
theater and enrich it and correlate it

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
and integrate it so we could illuminate

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
terrorist networks not in weeks or days

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
but in hours and minutes and provide

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,640
that actionable intel to the troops on

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,680
the ground

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
so my team sat in the middle of a base

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
in baghdad coding up the system and over

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
that time there were many small failures

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
but there was no failure of imagination

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
it was an environment of experimentation

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
and entrepreneurialism and teamwork and

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,360
creativity and we are empowered by some

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,240
of the most senior leaders to fail fast

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
to take risks

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
and ultimately over a period of weeks we

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
were able to get the system up and

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,159
running and it provided a capability

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,000
that helped to take thousands of

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
insurgents off the battlefield and save

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,640
lives

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
now after i returned from iraq i was

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
asked by general keith alexander then

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,640
the director of the national security

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
agency to stand up a new unit that would

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
leverage technology to deal with the

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
increasingly complex cyber threats we

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
were seeing on the horizon it would be

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,439
the army's first cyber operations unit

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
and just a few months later the military

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,920
suffered a devastating compromise when

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,758
an infected thumb drive was inserted

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
into a laptop at a base overseas with

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
malicious code spiraling across the

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
computers establishing a digital

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
beachhead for which sensitive data could

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,680
be exfiltrated it was to date the most

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
significant

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
breach of military networks and it was a

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
wake-up call

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
that the military needed to maneuver

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
differently in this new digital domain

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,239
and that it would require a new type of

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
command that would bring together

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
offensive and defensive military cyber

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
operations and because i was the

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
commander of the army cyber ops unit i

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
was asked to be part of a small team to

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
make that effort happen

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
it was me

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
army colonel paul nakasoni navy captain

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,680
tj white air force colonel sl davis all

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,519
operating out of a small office on the

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,840
eighth floor of nsa headquarters working

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
for general alexander and deputy

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,920
director chris inglis who empowered us

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,360
to design and create a new cyber warfare

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
command now in that small office we all

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
wore uniforms but there was no rank

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
it was just trust teamwork collaboration

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,879
imagination creativity

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,640
ultimately leading to the successful

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,080
stand-up of united states cyber command

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
now the common thread in each of these

90
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,920
stories and really a thread that's been

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
pulled from my earliest days as a west

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,400
point cadet to my time at morgan stanley

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
building our cyber security fusion

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
center to my current role at cisa

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,879
leading america's cyber defense agency

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,400
and that common thread is not about

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
operational success it's about the

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,599
environment that allows that success to

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,280
be possible

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
in a word

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,239
culture

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
as the saying goes culture eats strategy

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
for breakfast

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
and in my view it's the key to success

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
in the field of cyber security because

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,920
ultimately cyber security is not about

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,040
technology it's about people and

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
unlocking the power and potential of

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,480
people requires situating them in great

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
organizational culture

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
you know our world is incredibly

112
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
digitized and connected with a volume

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
variety of velocity of data expanding

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
exponentially

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,798
and that connectivity has brought us

116
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
much good

117
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,720
but as we've added more data points more

118
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
devices more platforms to the internet

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,919
we've created more points of failure and

120
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
we've increased the attack surface for

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
threats so now there's a cyber attack

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,720
roughly every 40 seconds 10 of websites

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
lead you to malware

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,479
cybercrime damages are expected to cost

125
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,960
the world 10.5 trillion dollars by the

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
year 2025

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
the same year when we expect there to be

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,479
3.5 million unfilled cyber security jobs

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
around the world

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
so the question is how do we grow a

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
diverse cyber workforce to develop

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
innovative approaches to countering

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,440
increasing cyber threats and how do we

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
incentivize the current workforce

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,199
some exhausted some burnt out to stay in

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
the field to thrive even

137
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
well the answer is that we as leaders

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,039
have to create organizational cultures

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,360
where our people love what they do

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
respect their colleagues are empowered

141
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,039
by their leaders

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,560
and feel like they're making a

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,759
difference every day

144
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,479
among the organizational imperatives of

145
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
this job i've spent a significant amount

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,400
of the last seven months

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
directly engaged with my workforce to

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,520
co-create a culture of core values and

149
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,759
core principles that define what we

150
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
expect from each other and what we

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
aspire to be

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,560
the themes include trust teamwork

153
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
collaboration imagination inclusion

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,199
innovation

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
empowerment resilience

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
and a fundamental recognition that no

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
asset is more important to an

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
organization

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,199
than our people it doesn't matter where

160
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
in the world that organization is it's a

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
universal truth

162
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
so what does that mean in practice

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
well it's a culture that recognizes

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,199
the importance of creating an

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
environment of psychological safety

166
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
where everyone feels they can be their

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
authentic self where they feel

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,319
empowered and supported and cared for

169
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,080
and always treated with dignity and

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
respect it's why we're instituting

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
workshops promoting psychological safety

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,280
across our workforce at cisa

173
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
it's a culture that recognizes the

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,960
importance of not just welcoming

175
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,319
diversity but truly celebrating it

176
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
because diversity neurodiversity ability

177
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
diversity of gender identity of sexual

179

background

180
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,639
all equals diversity of thought

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
and that makes us better puzzle solvers

182
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
that's why i'm proud to be one of the

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
first agencies to give our folks the

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,440
option of embedding their pronouns into

185
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
their email address as a small but

186
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
meaningful symbol of the importance of

187
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,680
embracing acceptance

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
it's a culture that recognizes that some

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,319
people can be just as effective working

190
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
at home

191
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
rather than a cubicle in an office that

192
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,440
it takes a long commute to reach that's

193
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
why we offer remote work for many of our

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
positions at sysa

195
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
it's a culture that recognizes that

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
pandemic fatigue and burnout and

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
languishing are all really real things

198
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,240
it's why we've made 2022 the year of

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
mental health because mental health is

200
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
health and it's why we've provided the

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
headspace mindfulness app available to

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,240
all of our employees for free

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
it's a culture that recognizes that

204
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,319
feedback is a gift

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,919
it's why we're one of the first federal

206
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,400
agencies to implement 360 degree

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
feedback for all our employees to

208
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
disincentivize managing up and to

209
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
incentivize teamwork and servant

210
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
leadership

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
it's a culture that recognizes we can't

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
be paralyzed by fear of failure but must

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
continuously learn from our mistakes and

214
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,879
from incidents and from events that's

215
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
why i was so proud

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,280
to appoint some truly incredible leaders

217
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,319
to our

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,520
first

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
cyber safety review board which will

220
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
assess our responses to significant

221
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
cyber incidents and make recommendations

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
on how we can improve

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
and it's a culture that recognizes that

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,840
trust is the foundation of any good

225
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
relationship from a marriage to a

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
business deal it's why last year we

227
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
established the joint cyber defense

228
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,320
collaborative or jcdc to move from

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
partnership to true operational

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
collaboration with the private sector

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
from information sharing to information

232
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,519
enabling and finally it's a culture that

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
recognizes that the human element of

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,839
cyber security is about more than the

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
cyber workforce it's also about the

236
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
billions of people around the world that

237
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
use technology every hour of every

238
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,880
our global population is now 7.9 billion

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
people 5.1 billion on mobile 4.7 billion

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,720
on the internet 4.5 billion on social

241
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,519
media in just one internet minute there

242
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,839
are now more than

243
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,160
575 thousand tweets one million facebook

244
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,839
logins two million snap sent 3.5 million

245
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
youtube videos watched 5.7 million

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,959
google searches and over 210

247
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,640
million emails sent in just one internet

248
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,600
minute

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
in a world so rich with data available

250
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
for social engineering it's not

251
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
surprising that over 93 of successful

252
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
cyber attacks start with a phishing

253
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
email

254
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,360
in such a world individuals may be the

255
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
last line of defense or

256
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,000
the weakest link

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
it's why a culture of resilience also

258
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
recognizes that good cyber hygiene

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,279
is critical to raising the security

260
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,560
baseline across the technology ecosystem

261
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,240
and it's why it says so we're reaching

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
beyond the cyber workforce to the

263
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
billions of technology consumers around

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
the world to raise awareness by

265
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,959
instituting a major cyber hygiene

266
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
campaign

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
and we're asking all of our partners

268
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
including you

269
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
to join us

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
starting with an effort to move beyond

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
the password and implement multi-factor

272
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,440
authentication

273
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
worldwide

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
because it can make us 99

275
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,720
less likely to get hacked

276
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
so to the theme of this conference of

277
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
developing innovative perspectives to

278
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
counter evolving cyber threats i submit

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
that cyber security is not about

280
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
technology or process or policy it's

281
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
about people and it's the responsibility

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
of all of us as leaders to create

283
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,959
organizational cultures that inspire

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,200
people and make it easier for everyone

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
using a device to protect themselves

286
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
creating such cultures requires

287
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,839
intentionality and relentless optimism

288
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,440
and an acknowledgement that at the end

289
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
of the day

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,560
we spend most of our waking hours at

291
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
work so it's incredibly important to

292
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
love what we do to feel like we're

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,959
making a difference and

294
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,880
to have fun

295
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,399
doing it

296
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
because to end on another movie line

297
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
this one from one of the greatest hacker

298
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,600
films ever

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
life moves pretty fast if you don't stop

300
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,959
and look around once in a while

301
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,120
you might miss it

302
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,360
thank you
