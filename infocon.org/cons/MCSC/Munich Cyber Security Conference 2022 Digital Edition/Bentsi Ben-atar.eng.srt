1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,480
um okay thank you for joining us for

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
mcsc 2022 um

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
thank you for um taking the time um

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,320
since you're an expert i would like to

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,279
ask you one question

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,640
why should

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,199
companies and people care about

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,119
supply chain attacks and hardware-based

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
security isn't this just a thing

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,439
of

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,800
government to government

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,360
cyber attacks at the state level against

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,280
military and intelligence units

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,600
so i think that's an excellent question

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,160
and an excellent starting point for for

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
the hardware-based attacks discussion

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
uh what you need to understand is that

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
attackers want to do well you know

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,879
they're

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,199
at the end of things there are rational

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,399
entities even they're a crooked cyber

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
cyber crime syndicate they want to do

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
well they want to succeed in their

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
attacks and they want to be able to

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,239
replicate their attacks and they want to

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
er to use as as

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
as most common elements in their attacks

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159
as possible because it makes their life

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,200
easier

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
now if you are a potential attacker and

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,080
you're

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
trying to target a certain bank or a

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,040
certain

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
a car manufacturer or a pharmaceutical

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
company

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,119
you have two main options one option is

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,799
to go with the let's call it the

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,680
standard way of of attacks or standard

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
procedures and then you need to go

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
head-to-head against existing

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
cybersecurity products which we know are

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,159
getting better in their grip on the ig

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,759
infrastructure

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
or you can find an alternative path into

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
the enterprise's assets and in that

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
sense the hardware-based attack vehicles

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
offer the attackers a highly lucrative

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
extremely successful

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
path into the enterprise's assets now if

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
i try to visualize things for you is

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
that you know look at your enterprise as

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
a house that you're trying to guard and

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
at the front door you put a lot of locks

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,280
and a lot of heavy doors and you weld

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
everything so if a potential attacker

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,400
comes in then you know he could go like

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
house of paper style and come out with

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
an innovative way of

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
hammering his way into the door and into

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,319
the safe or he could look up and see how

61
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,319
here on the second floor there's an open

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
window which doesn't have almost any

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,280
security on it so yeah i do need to

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
bring a ladder in order to get the into

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
the second floor but once i'm there

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,640
everything is wide open uh for me and i

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,519
can go in and out without being detected

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
so that's the the state of mind uh and

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
in that sense the attackers using a

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,080
hardware-based tools offers them a kind

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
of a invisibility cloak because due to

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
the fact that a lot of enterprises and

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,200
the market in general

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,280
perceived hardware-based attacks as kind

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,599
of a mic small sad fsv chinese north

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
korean type of

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
a type of struggle

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
they said okay i'm

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,519
i'm a manufacturer of automotive

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,200
parts or i'm a pharmaceutical company

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
i do not interest the north korean i'm

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
now interest of iran i don't have

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
nothing to do with it so who who do i

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
interest and then you have a false sense

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
of of security

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
the truth is is that every company has

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
their crown jewels that you need to

88
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
protect it could be an ip of a

89
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,159
of a very sophisticated polymer

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
substance that is a

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
provides an extremely durable plastic

92
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,840
material it could be

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
a pharmaceutical ip it could be the

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
footprint of uh

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
of a spare part for a for a m5

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,920
a

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
bmw that a manufacturer in china wants

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,159
to manufacture so

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,360
even if you're not government related or

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
you're not into intel or kind of a

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
homeland security type of business you

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,879
are still

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
much of a interest to those to those

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,400
attackers

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
uh but as always you know the the proof

106
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
is in actual attacks and i want to share

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
with you a couple of sample of attacks

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
that we've that we've seen

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,720
uh using hardware-based attacks and uh

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
recalling to my previous comment

111
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,120
hardware-based attacks come in two main

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
flavors they come either through

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
internal abuser um which i'll uh

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,840
explain

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,560
in

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
in a minute and the supply chain attacks

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
supply chain attacks in general also

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
divide into what we call two flavors by

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
itself there is what we call

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,280
hardcore supply chain attacks so if you

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
recall the story about bloomberg a

122
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,919
couple of years ago of a

123
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
certain entity manufacturing or taping

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
out chips

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
that were manipulated at the silicon

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
level that means that the chip itself

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,960
could be a legitimate chip that provides

128
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,240
a an spi buffer or an i square c a

129
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,479
driver or something like that but on top

130
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,720
of that on the silicon level it had an

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,039
additional functionality that allowed

132
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,320
sniffing out signals from the from the

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,199
server this component that looked like a

134
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
completely legitimate component found

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,880
its way to uh the assembly line and from

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
there to uh cloud vendors and so on so

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
this is what we call the hardcore supply

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
chain because it requires this one

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
really requires a kind of a state um

140
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,240
state-sponsored capabilities uh in order

141
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
to uh tape out this this chip

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,639
now the

143
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
other side of the supplied edge in

144
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
attacks is what we call the the soft uh

145
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
soft touch of supply chain attack so

146
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
let's say that

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,919
i want to go into a certain large german

148
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,199
bank now

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
obviously i'm aware of the fact that

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
this bank will probably be heavily

151
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
guarded and there's a lot of

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
physical access control measures and all

153
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,800
of that

154
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
so instead of trying to uh attack and

155
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
find my way into the bank through the

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
front door i can actually

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,039
look out look up and and see who's the

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,600
vendor the it equipment vendor or the

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
system integrator that provides the

160
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
equipment for that bank or who is the

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
courier company that provides that

162
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,639
equipment

163
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,720
and then i will either send someone to

164
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,440
work for that warehouse of that system

165
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
integrator or the courier for that

166
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
company and when i'll see oh there's a

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
package that i see that the final

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
address is a

169
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
deutsche bank headquarter then i'll

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
intercept that shipment i'll open up the

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
box

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
implant the device inside the switch

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
inside the laptop inside the keyboard

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,880
and repack everything and ship it

175
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
to its uh a final destination

176
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
the chances of someone actually

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,880
screening that equipment will be almost

178
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
minimal unless you're completely

179
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,000
paranoid um you know people usually

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,720
don't open up their keyboard or mouse or

181
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
or switches or or anything like that

182
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
and uh and you're in yeah once and once

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,599
you're in you can exfoliate the

184
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
information through various various

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
methods so that's the software

186
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
the software supply chain attacks

187
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
one example is that we've seen is that

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,639
in

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
in a server in a switch you have those

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
rj45

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,160
connectors ethernet connectors combo

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
type connectors and we've seen

193
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,199
a kind of a parasite uh connection over

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,000
that

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
uh

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
over one of those rj45 ports which

197
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
actually excluded any information of

198
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,319
that

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
specific port again without alerting any

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
or tripping on any of the intrusion

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
detection solutions that that company

202
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,879
had

203
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,800
so that's one example on the network

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
side the other example is from a

205
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
critical infrastructure from uh from a

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,879
country that has extreme retaliation

207
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,319
capabilities

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
and for this incident

209
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
a

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
several multiple hid devices

211
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,199
were

212
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,080
were switched hid devices uh in most

213
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
cases in the

214
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,680
in this domain will be a mouse or a

215
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
keyboard connected to an hmi terminal

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,639
the the kind that you see in uh

217
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,840
you know connected to uh

218
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
electricity manufacturing facility or

219
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,840
manufacturing facilities in general

220
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
obviously the network itself was air gap

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
with following best practices with

222
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,919
securing

223
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,880
your critical infrastructure so uh

224
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,440
you know data diodes for exalted

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
information and edr in place and ids and

226
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,720
all those scada sensors and

227
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
probes everything was in place

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
the only thing that wasn't in place is

229
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,839
the fact that

230
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,839
a keyboard was connected to an hmi

231
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,399
terminal and the attackers in this case

232
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
were able to switch some of the

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
keyboards in that facility

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
now the keyboard itself presented itself

235
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
on the logical domain as a legitimate

236
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
keyboard so it has the same

237
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
vendor id the same product id everything

238
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
that is required in order to previously

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,040
put this device on the allow list was

240
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
was in place on the logical domain this

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,279
device was completely legitimate but

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
inside that keyboard there was actually

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
a raspberry pi zero

244
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
that enabled the attacker to actually

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,279
run a very naive

246
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
no user privilege escalation was

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
required no it hasn't been flagged out

248
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
by any of the

249
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
existing solution and it allowed using

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,959
the raspberry pi zero w capabilities to

251
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,240
actually uh inject very naive payloads

252
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
and then extract the information and

253
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
and use the ad hoc mesh wireless

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
capabilities of that uh

255
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
pi zero in order to accelerate

256
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,959
information

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,240
so that by using a 20 25 us dollar

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
device and the tactile which is you know

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
you can

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
buy

261
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,399
out in the open you were able to take

262
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,000
down a a full-blown a critical

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
infrastructure facility

264
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
now the same way you can actually do the

265
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
same and

266
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
and harvest

267
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,320
production production files from

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
from your production machine so you know

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
you have those cnc machines and you have

270
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,279
those uh

271
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,440
a manufacturing

272
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,000
machinery that again they are completely

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
air gap and one of the

274
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
demos that uh that we did is with you

275
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,519
know

276
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
a guy would come up to us say oh we're

277
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
completely air gap there's no way you

278
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
could take anything out and then we'll

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,839
just switch a wired keyboard or a wired

280
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
mouse and then we could show him that we

281
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,800
can actually execute the e-drawing files

282
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
the pick and place files the

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
everything that he has on his machine

284
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
without being flagged out not as a mass

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
storage device not as a communication

286
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,800
device but as a simple keyboard running

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,240
their attack

288
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
and the most interesting examples that

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
we've seen was a biometric bypass

290
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,440
er again using a manipulated biometric

291
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
biometric sensor so instead of trying to

292
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,279
fabricate a fingerprint and using a you

293
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
know silica and then chemicals in order

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
to generate a rogue fingerprint

295
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
the attacker in this case placed a very

296
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,720
small board which is called the

297
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
beaglebone board actually it's very

298
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
relatively old board and created the

299
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
payload that actually allowed the

300
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
attacker to bypass the biometric measure

301
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
so you could actually put a smiley

302
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
sticker on that biometric sensor plate

303
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,000
and it will say that you know it's uh

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
it's hans or it's john or it's a alex a

305
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,800
it would approve everybody

306
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
so we see we see that happening we see

307
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
that happening in growing numbers and

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,920
you actually got a taste of it because

309
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
if you recall the the recent high

310
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
profile attacks that

311
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
we've encountered were actually supply

312
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
chain although they were software supply

313
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
chain attacks by by solo wins or or

314
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,560
other a supply chain attacks that use

315
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
open source

316
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,079
codes but again they are identical to

317
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
supply chain supply chain attacks

318
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
um we've seen them on the software side

319
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
and rest assure

320
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,880
that they happen on the hardware side as

321
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,680
well

322
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,760
and again to give you an example of how

323
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
easy it is if you recall a couple of

324
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,959
years back there was that nsa catalog

325
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,920
leak

326
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,639
which showed a variety of nsa

327
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,200
toolkits one of them was a device called

328
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,519
cottonmouth which was a kind of a usb

329
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
wireless interceptor

330
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
and back then at i think 2000 something

331
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,959
uh it was considered to be a state

332
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,680
state level tool now today you can go

333
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,839
into aliexpress or you can go to other

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
websites and you can buy a ninja cable

335
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
or an omg cable that provide the same

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
identical

337
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,480
capabilities at twenty five dollars

338
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
fifty dollars everything can be done

339
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
remotely if you uh you don't need to be

340
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,279
the brightest engineer in the room in

341
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,240
order to uh to identify uh

342
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
those devices

343
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
so um

344
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
hardware-based attacks do happen

345
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
companies commercial companies in

346
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,440
specifics are very reluctant to share

347
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,959
the fact that they've been breached on

348
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,760
this domain but rest assured this

349
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
happens

350
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
thank you very much um

351
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,040
just one follow-up question

352
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
do you even trust

353
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,120
your iphone's lightning cables and so on

354
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,920
or how do you even charge your iphone

355
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,639
yeah

356
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
so which the lightning cable obviously

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,360
has been tampered with as well hdmi

358
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
cables were tempered as well the i work

359
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
under the assumption that every digital

360
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,440
device that i'm using

361
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,839
a potentially could be could be hacked

362
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,959
and uh

363
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,959
you know that's a

364
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,800
bit being uh a bit paranoid uh but again

365
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
if you have important things that you

366
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
need to really

367
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,399
make sure that they're saved you will

368
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,240
use the

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
kind of a less digital type of way of uh

370
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
of writing things and and you do see you

371
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
know you do see people moving around

372
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
with uh going back to kind of a pencil

373
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,800
books and writing things down

374
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,959
instead of having everything digitally

375
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,920
on their

376
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,399
on their devices

377
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,839
thank you very much

378
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,920
i'll stop the recording now one second
