00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,440
excellencies ladies and gentlemen dear

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
friends from all around the world

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,440
good morning

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,519
good afternoon good evening wherever you

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,199
are at this point of time here from

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,359
munich in the house of the bavarian

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
economy to the eighth edition of the

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
munich cyber security conference again

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,119
as a digital edition

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
i'm very proud and glad that i can open

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,359
this conference here today

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
and in my short introduction word let me

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
briefly spend some context of the

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,200
content and and what we want to deliver

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
in our conference here

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,600
and the motto of this conference is

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
drifting clouds and we want to provide

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
some leadership perspective on the

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
ever-growing threat of the cyber attacks

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
and drifting clouds actually stands for

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
a lot of what happens in the world right

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,199
now

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,079
if we take two levels up and see weather

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
as part of our climate i think we all

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,080
know as human beings that we influence

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,439
our climate

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,600
and we also know that only through

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
cohesion and collective action of all

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,680
nations around the world we can

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
influence that climate will not

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,560
influence our planet too badly

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
if we take a level down and take weather

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
conditions to the current political

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,439
situation around the world but also the

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,600
security situation then we can see

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,759
really dark clouds

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,720
and eventually some storm coming up

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
and also the same thing it is only so

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
strong diplomatic initiative

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,720
and collective action that we can manage

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
these security threats and also

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
political um threats

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
and overcome them

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,479
and at the third part clouds in the

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,280
context of i.t and cyber security of

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
course have a different meaning

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
cloud infrastructures are a very major

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
part of today's it infrastructure of our

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,360
data management of iit management and in

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
that context we sometimes don't know

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
whether clouds are part of the problem

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,878
solving or part of the problem itself

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,120
and in this context we have tried to

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
build an agenda

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
for you which actually addresses a

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
couple of points and we have four themes

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
which we want to address the first theme

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,840
is how governments see

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
cyber security and what they want to do

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,239
about that that's the first part the

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
second part is how we want to mitigate

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
the challenges we have on the

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
ever-growing attacks

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,280
in the cyber world

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
and how to better anticipate that for

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
the future that's two themes and we want

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
to put a very special focus on the

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
security of supply chains

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
what we have experienced during the kobe

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
time is that the supply chain came very

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
much under scrutiny and we see from the

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
crunch of the chip crisis and for many

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
other materials that the supply chains

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
are very vulnerable so the security in

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,040
supply chains

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,159
are very

77
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
important in order to safeguard a

78
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,640
worldwide stability in many of the

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
economies around the world

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
and around those we have put a lot of

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
competent panelists together to give us

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,080
an input for the dialogue we need in

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
order to solve the ever-growing cyber

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
threats

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,640
and

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
with these short words i would like also

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
to hand over to the very first speaker

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
of today and i'm very pleased to welcome

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879

and vice president and responsible for

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
the security in the union he is here for

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
the second time we are together here in

93

the studio so we have to make a proper

94
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
handover like in corona times right so

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
