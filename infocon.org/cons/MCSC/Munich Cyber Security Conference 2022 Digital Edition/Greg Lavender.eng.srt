1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,080
hey greg good to see you again

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
hey chris uh nice to catch up uh after

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
this long covered physical separation

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,320
yeah i hope you're you're settled in

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,840
over there at intel it was uh great to

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,240
work with you at vmware and now we're

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,480
we're in this different setting so let's

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
uh let's go ahead and get into it

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,600
as i think back over the last few years

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,840
particularly some of the the time when i

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,080
was uh director at the cyber security

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
and infrastructure security agency uh in

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,279
the us

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,159
every year seemed to have some theme and

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
uh every year was certainly a little bit

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
different in terms of the security

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,000
challenges and the events that we faced

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,480
but between the time i spent in

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,800
the agency and the time i've since

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
been outside back in the private sector

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,039
two years in particularly really really

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,199
stand out to me uh 2017 with not pecha

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,160
and wannacry and bad rabbit and a host

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,039
of other events and then 2021 you know

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
really starting off the year with a bang

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
and addressing some of the uh solarwinds

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
issues and then getting right into

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,680
exchange hafnium

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
you think about the notable ransomware

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
events between colonial pipeline and in

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,119
jbs and then

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,840
unfortunately closing out the year with

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
log 4j

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,720
so

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,680
you know there's a big diversity

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
in terms of root cause between those two

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,479
years and the major events they have but

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,920
but you have a you have a pretty

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
significant r d

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
team at intel and as the chief

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
technology officer you're you're

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,759
responsible for renovation

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
so as you think about

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,079
whether it's those two years or just the

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
security issues that we have to deal

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
with

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
broadly what what are the most important

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,439
trends in security and some of the

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,119
breakthroughs that you're trying to to

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,200
drive it intel

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
yeah i mean that's a great question and

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,520
we all see the headlines but you know

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,719
there's others there's other sort of

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,320
nefarious things going on that don't

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
make the headlines and so

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,439
you know when i came in i've been here

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
about a little over seven months at

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
intel and uh as i came came in i

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
realized okay you know intel's got a

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
fundamental role to play in the

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
foundation of securing what i'll call

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
trusted computing platforms this has

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
been talked about industry at least for

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
20 years and i was like okay as the new

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
cto of intel how do i sort of pull

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,599
together

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
all the resources all the capabilities

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
across this you know big company to

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
basically really make a hard run at this

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
problem you know particularly the

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
foundational sort of say the chip level

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,239
and the operating system level the bios

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,040
level etc it turns out intel is already

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,959
doing a lot in securing the firmware

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
securing the bios we have a bounty

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
program that we run to get uh

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,239
you know

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
white hats to attack our systems and

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
identify any vulnerabilities we have and

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
we have an attestation service so every

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
server we ship you know through whatever

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,560
partners and vendors you know they can

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
attest to the the correctness of the

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,959
software the bios the firmware et cetera

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,319
so i think we have we had a strong

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
foundation but we didn't really sort of

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,280
had it all pulled together so i created

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
a security coe and pulled all the

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
constituent parts together the hardware

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,840
the firmware the software in and we

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
really look at it as you know how do we

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
provide a more trusted computing

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
platform and the whole industry needs to

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
line behind this so but that's just the

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
foundational layer if you then go up to

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
the next layer you have literally tens

97
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,159
of thousands if not hundreds of

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
thousands of open source software

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
ecosystems libraries etc and that

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,480
becomes an attack surface as we've seen

101
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,440
with recent events like log4j where

102
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
everyone's adopting this open source and

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,000
if one vulnerability gets exploited then

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,879
it has wide blast radius of problems so

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
i'm actually a member of this recently

106
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
formed open source security foundation

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,599
under the linux foundation and the ctos

108
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,440
and the leaders of many many companies

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
are actually

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
now there and this is the number one

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
priority for that organization is how do

112
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
we address the vulnerabilities of the

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
supply chain aspects of open source open

114
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
source you know there's a lot of great

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,239
creativity and innovation there but if

116
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
we also don't bring the security there

117
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,000
then we're all at risk and that provides

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
a vulnerability so you'll see more from

119
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
the open source security foundation as

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,239
we go forward into into this year

121
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
because this is the number one focus

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
yeah there are a couple words that you

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,238
use throughout that really stand out to

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,478
me and as you know i i spent time at

125
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,160
microsoft before coming back into the

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,919
government and i think back to the bill

127
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,320
gates trustworthy computing memo from

128
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,600
2003 and so this concept of trust where

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
trust is effectively the the you know

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
the coin of the realm

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
in the it industry and if you think back

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
to the super bowl the other day with uh

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
the coinbase ad with the qr code dancing

134
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
across the screen and and it really

135
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,639
generated an interesting you know

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,520
brouhaha in the infosec community but it

137
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
really came down to me that if if

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
someone can't uh you know click on a qr

139
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
code on a tv after the

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,600
the advertisement was you know about 16

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,240
million dollars worth of investment then

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,919
fundamentally we we've done something

143
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
wrong so i think it gets back to your

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
point of how do we work higher up the

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,520
stack in in the technology stack to make

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,800
sure that downstream it's more secure by

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
design and deployment and everybody can

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
benefit from that and and i think that's

149
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
particularly import important because

150
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
again pointing back to a few of the

151
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
events over the last couple years where

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
the adversary has targeted uh supply

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
chain and they're working further down

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,520
the supply chain as i see it into that

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
kind of middle market space some of

156
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,680
those increasingly systemically

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,479
important companies that provide

158
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
software solutions and services but they

159
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
don't have the massive security budgets

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
of the microsofts and the intels and

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
some of the others and so how you know i

162
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,919
think it's a it's a not just a good

163
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,160
thing it's a great thing when we provide

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,720
a more trustworthy foundation

165
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
so i want to i want to go back to the

166
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,319
open source piece that that you just

167
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,840
talked about so that that was uh

168
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,360
unfortunately one of those things that

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,199
you you kind of expect every year

170
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
something always happens right around

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,600
the holidays whether intentional or not

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
but it tends to ruin a bunch of leave

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,639
and holiday for for folks and we saw

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,800
incident response teams and technology

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
teams trying to get their arms around

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
where within their organizations they

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,000
were using this open source technology

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
and so putting aside for the moment the

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
concept of a software bill of materials

180
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
that may help people rapidly respond to

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
events like this i noted that

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
in the u.s the department of homeland

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
security recently stood up their cyber

184
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,360
safety review board and they're they're

185
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,039
going to take a among other things down

186
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,639
the road at least they're going to take

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,360
a look at log 4j they convened a group

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,319
of

189
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,880
key open source or key technology

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
executives to how to address

191
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
uh the the broader challenges of open

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
source software can you can you tell us

193
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
a little bit more about what you're

194
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,400
doing

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,960
on the board of the open source software

196
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
security foundation that open ssf that

197
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,639
you mentioned

198
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,440
what do we think we can do here and uh

199
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
how can we incentivize

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,880
more secure outcomes uh more broadly

201
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
yeah let me just give you a little

202
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,840
sample from my own background i worked

203
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
in financial services for six years and

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
i had a cto level role broad

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,080
responsibilities and of course cyber

206
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,880
security engineering was a key function

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,360
in my organization and of course the cso

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
set policy and the sock you know ran the

209
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,840
uh day-to-day you know firefight with

210
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
all the adversaries but it was always

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
like you know you know i think i had

212
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
over 150 security products deployed

213
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
throughout the environment and when i

214
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
would give the board an update they

215
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,319
would sort of say well you know can you

216
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,919
give me a guarantee

217
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
that we won't be hit and i says well no

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,960
i can only give you a guarantee that

219
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
we're as good as we think we can be

220
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
until the next event

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
and we always assumed that we would be

222
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
hit and we would have it's all about you

223
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
know the cyber kill chain and how do you

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
recover from the event right so you

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
can't just keep building the wall higher

226
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
and higher and this is this is the

227
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,199
dilemma and so

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,199
i you know we used a lot of open source

229
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,120
and so i did what many you know large

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
organizations who can afford to do is i

231
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
had my own internal repos of all the

232
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
open source technologies that were

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
authorized for use across you know the

234
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,319
firm globally and you know ran you know

235
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
technology like black duck and you know

236
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
sonar cube all these sort of scanning

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
tools even to make sure that what i had

238
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,759
in that repo and and i blocked all

239
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,479
access to external open source uh

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,719
accessed by any developers in the firm

241
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
and so that way i sort of had you know a

242
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
reasonably good guarantee but we still

243
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
got bit by open ssl so we had the open

244
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,479
ssl heartbleed everyone will remember

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,320
that one from a few years ago and it

246
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
took me several months and several

247
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
millions of dollars just to remediate

248
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
that with my own technologies but all

249
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
the vendors had it embedded in routers

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
switches and firewalls as well so you

251
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
have to wait for all the vendors to do

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,959
it so it's a pretty big blast radius

253
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,959
when something like that occurs so i

254
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,880
think you know the industry we're now at

255
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
a much larger scale than that was just

256
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
eight or nine years ago so we're a much

257
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
larger scale now of available open

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
source and we all want the innovation we

259
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
all want that technology but you know if

260
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,640
everybody has to go create what i

261
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
created at a major financial institution

262
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
at some great expense right we're just

263
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
not going to scale to that problem so i

264
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
really think it's up to the community

265
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
together you know to bring together a

266
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,360
secure open source repo and we can all

267
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
pay our little fair share to access it

268
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
but that we know that all the code

269
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
that's in there has a provenance that we

270
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
could trace back to named individuals

271
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
right we can put a risk rating on every

272
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,680
single code contribution if we need to

273
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
and we have all the power of all the

274
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
best tools in the industry to run

275
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
against that right and so i really think

276
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,240
i think what i'm pushing and what i'd

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,040
like to see is is a shared common set of

278
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
repos global level maybe they're

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,440
regionally you know sort of uh attested

280
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,160
to

281
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
and and then you know when you get that

282
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
code you should be able to run it on an

283
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
intel platform or amd platform an arm

284
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
platform or whatever and have a trusted

285
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
computing foundation and intel wants to

286
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
be a leader we will be a leader in this

287
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
space with our technology and i will put

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
my money where my mouth is to enable

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
this to happen in the open source

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
community

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,519
well i you know you you hit on a couple

292
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,000
things there uh that i found interesting

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
i think first is it it really is going

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
to rely upon big technology

295
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
companies to make the investments to

296
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
ensure we have that scalability and

297
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
extensibility but another interesting

298
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
thing i'm seeing is that that kind of

299
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,240
first generation of cyber security and

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,959
technology

301
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
you know folks that hit it big are

302
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
starting to plow through philanthropy

303
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
efforts back into

304
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,120
into the community you know i think

305
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
about craig newmark and ron goula a lot

306
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
of folks that have that have done well

307
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,680
and really have a sense of community and

308
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,959
so i expect to see a lot more of that

309
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,320
and i think that's a that's that's

310
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,480
really kind of the path forward

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
you mentioned another thing in there at

312
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
the very beginning was

313
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
about uh briefing boards on uh you know

314
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
what are some of the key metrics and

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
assurances i think that's that's

316
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
probably greg maybe a separate panel

317
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
conversation that we should have kevin

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
mandia talks about this and it cracks me

319
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
up but he says you know when he goes in

320
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
front of boards and you know you throw

321
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
green harvey balls up there

322
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
and the board doesn't believe you throw

323
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
yellow they get frustrated and then uh

324
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,839
when you throw all red up they they they

325
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
lose hope so we've got to come to i

326
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
think some sort of uh better approach to

327
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
translating and

328
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
discussing risk at the executive level

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,200
so again let's let's maybe do that uh do

330
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,519
that panel next year in munich

331
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
all right so let's close this one out we

332
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
got a third let's let's move on to chips

333
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
uh really i think the the strong suit of

334
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
intel right now so one of the one of the

335
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
many takeaways that i had from covid uh

336
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
was the supply chain stresses and the

337
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
incredible demand for chip

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,519
semiconductors and the technology that

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,920
was helping us get through this event i

340
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
mean you still look out today it's hard

341
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
to get some of the things like a

342
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
playstation 5 you know automobiles in

343
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,079
particular

344
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,839
new new vehicles at least running off

345
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,560
the line even boats so can you can you

346
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
tell us a little bit about uh what

347
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
you're seeing out there in the world

348
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,880
about how we're boosting supply because

349
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
it's not just about the diversity it's

350
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
about boosting that supply and you know

351
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
i've seen that the the european union's

352
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,519
making big plans to address the chip

353
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,000
shortage the us has made uh some

354
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
legislative bets and and i think there's

355
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
probably room for additional funding so

356
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
tell us you know with all this in mind

357
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,040
what

358
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
how how does a uh resilient supply chain

359
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,720
for chips enhance national and regional

360
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,959
defense including in the eu

361
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,560
uh for uh defense and security goals

362
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
yeah you know i'm not i'm a

363
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
semiconductor supply chain expert you

364
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,720
know from a software guy who's built a

365
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
career and made a good living off of all

366
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
the semiconductor technology that's been

367
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
developed since you know i started you

368
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
know with the 80-85 and like when i was

369
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
in high school

370
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,519
and so you know here we are today where

371
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,440
the whole world is just super highly

372
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
dependent on semiconductor technology

373
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
and all the software we were just

374
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
talking about

375
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
and so as the cto of intel now i sort of

376
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,399
look at this and say okay

377
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,920
you know i'm addressing the software

378
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
part i said i'll address the trust you

379
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
know part on the computing side but you

380
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
know the fundamental problem is just the

381
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
demand is accelerating right so that the

382
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
fundamentally is it's in a demand

383
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
problem and then we have you know

384
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,240
dependency all the way back to the rare

385
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,519
earth metals

386
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,880
right that we have to mine out of the

387
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
ground to produce these semiconductor

388
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
technologies and create the wafers and

389
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
do all the processing so it's a complex

390
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,680
ecosystem right companies like asml in

391
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
europe which were partners and would do

392
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,079
joint research with and

393
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,760
you know i think the whole industry is

394
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
dependent on a small number of suppliers

395
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,240
for this advanced technology and we need

396
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
diversity in that in the in the

397
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,800
manufacturing which u.s has now done

398
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
with the uh the 20 billion investment in

399
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
the state of ohio including money for

400
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
academic research and partnerships with

401
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
academia and incentive incentivize

402
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,480
innovation and then you know um we're

403
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
we're obviously pro european following

404
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,360
suit with uh european chips act if i

405
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
could call it that and so you know and

406
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,959
we've already got research partnerships

407
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,160
and investments in high performance

408
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
computing with academic institutions

409
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,079
we've got a quantum computing effort

410
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,920
going on in intel labs partnered with

411
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
european university so i think you know

412
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,959
our strategy is europe has a huge demand

413
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,800
particularly with the auto industry in

414
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
the manufacturing industry that's there

415
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
that's very strong and so i think we

416
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
need diversity global diversity of that

417
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
supply chain the global diversity of the

418
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
manufacturing capacity right to give

419
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
some level level the playing field and

420
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
provide more choice for the industry and

421
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,920
for the world

422
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
yeah i look i had a saying when i was at

423
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
cisa defend today secure tomorrow if

424
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,800
we're not thinking about how to address

425
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
tomorrow's challenges then we're we're

426
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
going to be blocking and tackling on

427
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
today's issues for the rest of our lives

428
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
so it's great to hear about you know

429
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,320
what what intel is doing looking forward

430
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,519
and how to address some of those

431
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
challenges so greg uh we're at time i

432
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
really appreciate uh chatting with you

433
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
today thanks for your insight on some of

434
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,920
those key pressing issues for today and

435
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
uh you know i think the broader munich

436
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,079
cyber security conference is going to

437
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,880
benefit from this conversation

438
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
thanks and i'll quote my uh my boss pat

439
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,079
gelsinger who says you know

440
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,399
semiconductors are the the oil of the

441
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
21st century and we have to think of it

442
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,639
that way

443
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
great thanks craig

444
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,319
thank you
