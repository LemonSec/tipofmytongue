00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
individuals to have this conversation

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,600
particularly given in the the political

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,199
time that we are in right now with the

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
geopolitical environment and i know uh

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,960
everybody is joining from different time

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
zones and certainly look forward to this

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
discussion uh as you just heard from the

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
director of our agency jen easterly at

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
cisa the cyber security and

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
infrastructure security agency in the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
united states we're dedicated to

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,320
building a culture of resilience to

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640
strengthen our digital infrastructure in

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
the long run and as part of this global

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
community one of the efforts that i'm

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,600
particularly interested in as we focus

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,920
on looking at how sisa can engage

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
collaboratively across the global

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
environment i'm interested in this

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
conversation as we look to really build

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
out cyber resilience global cyber

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
resilience worldwide as we all know

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,840
cyber security doesn't respect

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
boundaries it is something that we all

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
have to come together to engage upon and

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
uh this panel is an incredible caliber

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
of experts for this discussion and

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
without going any further we'll jump

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
right into the conversation and i want

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
so much everybody for joining us today

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,799
so we'll get right into the conversation

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,479
firstly as we look at this environment

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,560
the geopolitical environment uh the

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
active one today uh we recognize it's

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,960
really since the beginning of the

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,719
pandemic but it's hard to know where the

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,399
lines on this really started or where

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
the the current event started the scope

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,280
and severity of cyber attacks has really

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,879
been increasing uh certainly with the

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
pandemic we saw with the move to work

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
from home the interdependencies that

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
were created and the vulnerability of

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
the threat platform getting larger with

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
everybody working on their own digital

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
devices and looking at that

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
interconnectedness and in the past year

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,400
we've witnessed really a series of major

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
ransomware attacks major events uh on

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
jbs the us colonial pipeline but other

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
cyber attacks and ransomware in the

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,720
context of geopolitical tensions so i'd

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,879
like to ask ask each of you as we start

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,360
this conversation from an agency

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
ministry and country perspective what's

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
your assessment of the current cyber

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,160
threat but importantly

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
get in light of your assessment what are

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
you focused on what are you prioritizing

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
in addressing it and now lindy i'll

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
start with you

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,120
thanks very much indeed kirsten and

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
fantastic to be here and have had a

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
chance to hear jen's amazing knows so

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
you know i think we're in a really

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
exciting year for cyber security it's

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
important not to see this just as a set

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
of threats albeit the current context

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
means we have to but actually has a set

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
of opportunities the reason cyber

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,560
security is higher up the agenda and

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
it's higher up a much bigger agenda you

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,840
know this was discussed last year at the

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
g7 is because it's about the

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
opportunities of technology as well as

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
the national security threats but i

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
think the really great thing for me is

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
that this now is the subject of

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
conversation between world leaders

102
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,440
because this is something that is no

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
longer seen simply as a technical set of

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,799
issues as jen said it's an

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
organizational culture set of issues and

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,159
in fact it's a geopolitical set of

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,680
issues so for me there's a real

108
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,920
opportunity this year to take cyber

109
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
security out of a technical conversation

110
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
and into a political and strategic

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
conversation that says actually this is

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
something for everybody but it's not

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
something to be scared of it's something

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
you can do something about each of you

115
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
as private citizens as members of

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,519
organizations can actually do something

117
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,120
to improve your own personal resilience

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
your organization's resilience but

119
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,159
actually it's something that we really

120
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
do have to take seriously because we

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,040
want people to be able to live and work

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
safely online in our own countries and

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959
globally and to do so confidently i

124
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,959
think so for me it's that moment of

125
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,399
political change that is the biggest

126
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
sort of turning point in cyber security

127
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
at the moment but i think of course you

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
know we can't not reflect on the current

129
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
crisis where i think that you know this

130
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
is a moment where we are certainly

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
um re-emphasizing to organizations the

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
real importance of making sure that they

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
are prepared not just for the kind of

134
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
cyber criminality that we see but also

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
for potential uh for state action in a

136
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
way that means that they need to have

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
built their resilience it's not about

138
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
asking them to do new things it's about

139
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
asking them to carry on doing the things

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
they should have been doing anyway but

141
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,759
to do them faster and better in order to

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
anticipate a level of uncertainty and so

143
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
i think we're taking that as a moment to

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
kind of get people to shift their

145
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,880
behavior and shift it faster but i think

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
then the third thing i just say is that

147
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,639
it will be easy for the current

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,280
geostrategic crisis to to pull us onto a

149
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
very tactical set of issues currently

150
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
it's really important that we don't lose

151
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
sight of the trajectory of change in

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
technology in the long term which i

153
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,360
think is the big trend that we need to

154
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
really get ahead and that's where i'm

155
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,560
asking my organization to spend a lot of

156
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
time thinking very imaginatively about

157
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
what technology of the future will look

158
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,280
like in a way that means we should think

159
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,639
about what cyber security of the future

160
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,560
looks like as well

161
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
thanks so much lindy and you you really

162
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,240
captured this the the spectrum of what

163
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
we're dealing with which is the work on

164
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
human behavior ensuring that individuals

165
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
really understand their accountability

166
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,479
and responsibility in cyber security

167
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,800
from strong authentication to looking at

168
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
you know fishing and all these pieces

169
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
and i know the ncsc has led some

170
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
tremendous work with small businesses

171
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
and that really is so important and then

172
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
on the other end uh at that evolution is

173
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
inspiring and encouraging innovation to

174
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
recognize that you know we've got to be

175
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
able to look at this full spectrum and i

176
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
think it's so critical to see this

177
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
comprehensively and looking at cyber is

178
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
truly interdisciplinary um and there's

179
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,240
there's a lot that you talked about that

180
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
i definitely want to follow up on but

181
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,160
i'll uh turn it over next to benjamin uh

182
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
as you look at this and your assessment

183
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,039
of the threat and what you're

184
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,400
prioritizing

185
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,080
how would you lay out that sequence

186
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,559
benjamin i think you're on mute

187
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
do you think that after two and a half

188
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,880
years of this we have gotten that back

189
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
but thank you very much kirsten for the

190
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
question and uh thank such a pleasure to

191
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
be on this panel with such illustrious

192
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,479
speakers and thank you lindy for such a

193
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
positive view of the opportunities

194
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
rather than just the threats because

195
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,319
there are a lot of threats and the

196
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
pandemic definitely hasn't helped

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
reduce any of them cyber crime has

198
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,759
really increased in the asian region

199
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
asean countries have experienced a lot

200
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,319
of

201
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,280
phishing

202
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
a lot of

203
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
scams and

204
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,039
this also has been a problem because

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,360
many of us have had to go online there's

206
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
been a digital divide problem in many of

207
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
the asean countries where people who

208
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
were not previously online had to get

209
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
online very quickly and possibly on

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
systems that were not as secure and

211
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
without the training in security to be

212
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
able to keep themselves safe

213
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,520
so

214
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,880
if you look at it from an opportunity

215
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
point of view this is actually the

216
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
opportunity to get everybody to

217
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
understand better how to give themselves

218
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
a better cyber hygiene

219
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,360
and for the whole of society to really

220
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
band together to help those who are at a

221
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
disadvantage to

222
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,759
get on board so that they can come on

223
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,000
board and benefit from all the benefits

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
of digital transformation in a safe way

225
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,919
because

226
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
it is a problem that if people are not

227
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,840
equipped

228
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,560
with either with the adequate technology

229
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
or with adequate information then it's

230
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
very difficult for them to protect

231
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
themselves and so it's both hand in hand

232
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,400
as a whole of society we've got to do

233
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,520
that and

234
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,879
in the

235
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,319
asean context

236
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,440
the

237
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
other than cyber crime of course there

238
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,639
is a concern that a geopolitical

239
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
situation can spill over to us because

240
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
the supply chain is international and we

241
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,319
are part the asean countries are part of

242
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
that supply chain

243
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
and we have many businesses

244
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
in singapore whether they are ukrainian

245
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
businesses russians businesses chinese

246
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
businesses us businesses uk businesses

247
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
who could become collateral damage and

248
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,039
then of course spill over into our

249
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
situation as we learn from the wannacry

250
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,639
and not badger situations so cautiously

251
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,039
hopefully

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
thank you so much and thank you for

253
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
enforcing and emphasizing this cyber

254
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,279
hygiene piece i think you know we still

255
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,360
there's been this expectation that

256
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
solutions rely only in technology and so

257
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
as we look at what again to lindy's

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,559
point that individual responsibility but

259
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
then how do we marry that with

260
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
technology and innovation to help us

261
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
move to the next place um peter i'll ask

262
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,120
you your thoughts on on this issue and

263
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
the assessment of the current threat

264
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,519
thank you it's a pleasure to be here

265
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,880
so in a hungarian perspective and as we

266
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,279
see in our constituency the number and

267
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
the severity of

268
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,399
ransomware attacks are also increasing

269
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
the major threat is that there is no

270
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
longer just factor factories or critical

271
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,160
references infrastructures sorry and

272
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
services that are being attacked but

273
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,440
also has cascade facilities which means

274
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
that he is a real threat to human life

275
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,720
so the increase in the number and

276
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
complexity of phishing attacks is also a

277
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,240
major problem and it's a vector for the

278
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
attacks

279
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,920
or tax authorities are now refunding

280
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,930
personal income

281
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,000
[Music]

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
tax

283
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
and it is exploited by criminal

284
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,760
organizations for the purpose of fishing

285
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
sometimes fishing

286
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
sites are using

287
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,519
goep ip filtering and redirect from a

288
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,399
foreign ip address to the rio site

289
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
that's make it more difficult to

290
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,839
convince

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,920
foreign service providers

292
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
to shut down the malicious websites so

293
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,959
as as

294
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,880
in north perspective

295
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,760
coordination communication and working

296
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
together with other nations is very

297
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,279
important to tackle these difficulties

298
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,839
and regarding the russian and

299
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,000
ukrainian conflict

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
the attribution is very hard to to do in

301
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,160
such a attacks and earnings incidents so

302
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
we haven't detected any offense or

303
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
offensive activity uh regarding these

304
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
conflicts that we can surely attribute

305
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
to any kind of uh

306
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,959
transactors

307
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,720
thank you so much painter uh and arne uh

308
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
as you look at these issues um from the

309
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,200
perspective of of germany how would you

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,959
assess the threat and importantly what

311
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
are you prioritizing and how you're

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
addressing it

313
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,720
yes cousin thank you very much and to be

314
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
very clear i would love to see you live

315
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
on stage

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
even if i'm a head of a national cyber

317
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
security authority i really would love

318
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,040
to see you live because i prefer to do

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,240
it this way

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
because then we can have much more

321
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
interaction on all the different kind of

322
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,240
areas

323
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
and this is exactly what covert 99 i

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
think first of all has shown us very

325
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
clearly

326
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
that we are now living much stronger in

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,519
a digitized age than before

328
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
and this made it very clear also that

329
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
potential attackers are having a much

330
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,920
larger scale how to attack us and this

331
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,279
is something i think what we have seen

332
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,959
over the last years

333
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,399
in october in germany i published

334
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,320
the so-called annual i.t security report

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
there we made it very clear

336
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
that for example

337
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
we see per day per day for more than 400

338
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,639
000 new variants of malware

339
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
this is compared to 21

340
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,920
an increase to 2020 an increase of 22

341
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
percent

342
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,399
and the criminals and the other actors

343
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,720
are not providing all this malware just

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
for fun it's not their hobby it is for

345
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
earning money

346
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
for doing something with it

347
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,079
we

348
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
have seen of course some uh great

349
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
ransomware attacks ddos attacks and so

350
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
on all this is on the rise we saw it

351
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,880
towards local governments

352
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
we saw to many organizations we saw two

353
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
hospitals

354
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
to companies

355
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
and therefore we have stated in october

356
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
last year already that in

357
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
some parts

358
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,519
that we are having a kind of red alert

359
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
in the overall cyber scrap

360
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,399
landscape

361
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
for example within germany we have seen

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
we have

363
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
related malware infections we have sent

364
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,200
to the so-called provider we have

365
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,959
doubled the

366
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,519
notifications to the provider from 7 to

367
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,440
14 million

368
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
and we have of course increased also the

369
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
malicious malware attacks to the german

370
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,279
government

371
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,320
from

372
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,639
35 000 to 44 000 per month

373
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,519
and for me it is very important that the

374
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
overall as you have said question the

375
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
it is not a static situation we are

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,839
looking for it's a very dynamic

377
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,600
situation we see of course

378
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
malicious actors that plan to do

379
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
sabotage which we which are going to use

380
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
ransomware

381
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
we see it quite clearly and i think

382
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,240
you see it in the same way like we do

383
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
we see it that some conflicts outside of

384
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
europe let's say let's put it that way

385
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
can

386
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,040
move towards europe and other actors

387
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,160
by accident

388
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,600
and we see

389
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,199
and this is something which is

390
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,320
increasing

391
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,079
hackers for hire

392
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,160
so therefore you don't need to have your

393
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,880
own capability it is very easy

394
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,680
to

395
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,120
to purchase to procure hackers

396
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
on the darknet on other kind of criminal

397
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,560
areas

398
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
and they are selling their exploits and

399
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
malware to international customers who

400
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
is who is paying most is getting this

401
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
kind of expertise so this is something a

402
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,279
kind of shifting away from where you

403
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
need to have the own resources

404
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,760
to that you can just hire it like an

405
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
account you can hire you're a hacker who

406
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,079
is going to do the work for you

407
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,440
and this of course

408
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
will become very important and therefore

409
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
i think for me there are three areas

410
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,639
which we have to intensify one is

411
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,959
technologically yes

412
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,480
otherwise it will be extremely difficult

413
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
to identify

414
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,399
the actors number two is international

415
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
cooperation that's why i'm so grateful

416
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
that we're having this panel here i

417
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,360
think it's great to be with our friends

418
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
from hungary

419
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
from singapore from the u.s and from the

420
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,399
uk to discuss how to move forward

421
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,079
jointly together we have to come and go

422
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,959
there

423
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,959
and number three that's exactly what

424
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,160
jean has already said it is cyber

425
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
hygiene how to train the people because

426
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
just technology will not work just

427
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
people will not work so it needs to be a

428
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
combination out of it so that's how i

429
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,639
see it thank you very much

430
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,440
thank you so much and as you talk and as

431
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,959
each of you has spoken about the

432
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
integration of different elements uh to

433
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,199
help not only assess the threat but how

434
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,120
are we going to address it one of the

435
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,199
key elements to all of this as we have

436
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,760
looked at it is how we work with

437
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
industry and government

438
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
in uh january of this year the uk has

439
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
published a cyber security strategy as

440
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
part of an investment in cyber security

441
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
in the united states there's been

442
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
greater investment in the cyber security

443
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
and infrastructure security agency on

444
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
the public side but as we know what we

445
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
often say in the u.s government is cyber

446
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,839
is a team sport this is not going to be

447
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,079
achieved accomplished overcome by any

448
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,399
one entity and that is true obviously

449
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,720
across industry and government and the

450
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
other evolution of this thinking is

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
we've talked a lot about public-private

452
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,079
partnerships but how do we really

453
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,839
operationalize that and so one of the

454
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,839
terms that we're using at cisa is very

455
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,839
much about operational collaboration and

456
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,920
you heard jen mention that in her in her

457
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
address and i think as we look at this

458
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,759
it's really how are industry and

459
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,240
government working together effectively

460
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,199
and so i would ask each of you how is

461
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,199
your public sector equipped for attacks

462
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
and importantly how are you working with

463
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
industry and are you seeing any

464
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,639
successes or particular challenges in

465
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
light of the threat in light of what's

466
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,320
happened over the last couple of years

467
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
and benjamin i'll start with you

468
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,519
thanks christian

469
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,560
i think that our public sector has been

470
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
pretty secure and

471
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
not just from my view but since we were

472
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,720
ranked fourth in the

473
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,279
itu's global cyber security

474
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,920
index gci for 2020 and there's a huge

475
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
budget of

476
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
a billion singapore dollars which is

477
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,199
about u.s 700 million but

478
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,800
aside from that good news and the fact

479
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
that the critical infrastructure

480
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
providers are also required by law to

481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
harden their cyber security one of the

482
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
things that we've really been very

483
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
cognizant about in singapore is the need

484
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,039
for the whole

485
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,000
of the population to be secure because

486
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,039
it's not

487
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
necessarily just the public sector or

488
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,319
the critical infrastructure that's going

489
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,640
to be a target because once these are

490
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,359
hard and then the soft underbelly is

491
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,679
actually the person in the street

492
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,559
and

493
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
that's why singapore launched the safer

494
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
cyberspace master plan which is a whole

495
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,679
drive to get everybody the small

496
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,280
businesses the medium businesses which

497
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,840
actually make up the huge chunk of

498
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,160
every economy especially the asean

499
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,919
economies and to person in the street

500
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,720
to get that awareness out on cyber

501
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
security cyber hygiene just to give an

502
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
example without having to hit the banks

503
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
recently there was a hard speed of

504
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,320
phishing scams on one of the major banks

505
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
and dozens of people were cheated out of

506
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
their entire life savings and the banks

507
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
had to do a huge um well legally they

508
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
were protected they could have actually

509
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,160
washed their hands out of it but because

510
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,080
it was such a huge thing they had to

511
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,480
give out goodwill reimbursements of to

512
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
the tunes of millions of dollars

513
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
and if you can imagine if this had been

514
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,679
scaled up and then combined with a

515
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
cyber-enabled information operation you

516
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
could have

517
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
started a panic run on the banks it

518
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
could have really affected the financial

519
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,840
system and for countries which are very

520
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
interconnected with other countries and

521
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,120
depend a lot on trade that would be

522
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,799
disastrous so

523
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,000
really the

524
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
it was really attacking the banks

525
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
through the customers and that's

526
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,559
something that we have really been very

527
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,760
very aware of now

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
thank you benjamin uh would anyone else

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
like to talk about efforts underway to

530
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
both secure the public sector and or

531
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,820
engagement with industry

532
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,880
[Music]

533
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,120
if i can i mean i really like it

534
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,039
so i mean you know i think the uk public

535
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
sector has come a long way i think you

536
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,559
know particularly our critical national

537
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,000
infrastructure you know sectors are

538
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
really stepped up

539
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,000
uh we're helping to use uh our cyber

540
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,679
assessment framework to help them assess

541
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,520
their own maturity and think about

542
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
bluntly then what the right level of

543
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
maturity is for different sectors who

544
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,760
have different needs in the same way

545
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,799
they do actually in a range of other

546
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,039
security issues and but i think you know

547
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,799
we have to be conscious that the

548
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,400
governments and public sectors face

549
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
particular risks in particular i think

550
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
from state actor interest whether that's

551
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
you know espionage to find information

552
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,120
or whether that's the potential for

553
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
and other kinds of cyber incidents and i

554
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
think therefore we certainly expect that

555
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,720
our own public sector it really takes a

556
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
leadership role in this and demonstrates

557
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
what's possible that's partly why we put

558
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
a level of protection around them with

559
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
things like our active cyber defense

560
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
program but it was also actually why the

561
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
uk government published its government

562
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,880
cyber security strategy recently

563
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
uh which is an attempt to demonstrate

564
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
the kind of resilience we expect and its

565
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
two major focus areas are you that

566
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,960
really basic focus on resilience so

567
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,039
really drumming home that we expect

568
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
every organization in the public sector

569
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
to have prepared itself to be resilient

570
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
against a reasonable range of of threats

571
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
and actually to be conscious of the kind

572
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,280
of threats they face so one of the

573
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
things recently for example i did was to

574
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,200
talk to suppliers of government and in

575
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,760
particular i.t suppliers who sometimes

576
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
think of themselves as having the kind

577
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
of risk associated with an i.t company

578
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
but actually if you're a supplier to

579
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,240
government in many ways you take on the

580
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
level of risk of the people you supply

581
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,679
as well and we need the people in that

582
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,600
supply chain to be really conscious of

583
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
how their cyber security affects the

584
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
cyber security of the organizations that

585
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
they serve as well i think that's been

586
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
an increasing trend that we've seen

587
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,760
over the last year or two and something

588
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
we're certainly pushing much harder for

589
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,520
example in our own procurement processes

590
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
because again as government we can set

591
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
expectations of what good procurement

592
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,880
looks like in this space that then

593
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,400
actually help to change the market

594
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
because frankly if we're asking for

595
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,000
others can ask for it too as well

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
and so i think you know we're keen to

597
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,720
see a lot of resilience but we're also

598
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
keen to talk about defending as one in

599
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,159
the uk we don't quite have the model

600
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,000
that some organizations do in terms of

601
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
the sort of single government i.t system

602
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,280
you know we've allowed a real

603
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,960
proliferation of different systems over

604
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
time in order to be able to take

605
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,679
advantage of the kind of you know

606
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,520
commodity technology that that gives us

607
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
you know the ability to buy of

608
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
cutting-edge systems but actually what

609
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,159
we want people to do is understand that

610
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,360
there's also a level of collective

611
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
responsibility again that you know one

612
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,360
part of the public sector can introduce

613
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
risk to another part and therefore it's

614
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,720
really important that people see that

615
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
collective sense of responsibility and

616
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,159
don't simply assume that they're not

617
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
always much interest because they're not

618
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,080
big service providers or you know more

619
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
sophisticated you know parts of

620
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
government that have national security

621
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
concerns yeah just because of that

622
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
doesn't mean you're not an interesting

623
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
place for uh for an adversary to

624
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
consider acting so i think we really are

625
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
asking for a complete step up in in

626
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
resilience

627
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,240
and a different level of awareness you

628
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,760
know as technology changes we want to

629
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,039
see the uk government you know really

630
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,320
leading the way and making the uk the

631
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,679
safest place to live and work online and

632
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,120
that's partly why in the last spending

633
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,640
review the government announced

634
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
investing 2.6 billion in both cyber

635
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
security but also legacy i t and they

636
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
you know their willingness to take this

637
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,679
to a different level and say so publicly

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,679
thanks very much lindy and i want to um

639
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,799
just pull out a couple of things that

640
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
you said i think uh peter and i both

641
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,720
wanted to respond to this question you

642
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
talk about supply chain and obviously as

643
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
the digital economy grows and the

644
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
interdependencies grow the lines around

645
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,039
what is critical and what is not have

646
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
blurred pretty significantly because of

647
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,799
how we're all connected particularly

648
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,400
with the financial infrastructure

649
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
and communications infrastructure and

650
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
very much uh support what you say

651
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
obviously about government as really

652
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
using the power of the purse to change

653
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,600
behavior so it's a bit you know you can

654
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
say these are the standards that you

655
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,880
should should act but if you're saying

656
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
you can't work with government unless

657
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
you do certain things that starts to

658
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,559
really move the needle the united states

659
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,919
the government's the you know the

660
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,559
largest client customer certainly um

661
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,159
with its uh with its investment and i

662
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,520
think globally a it's a really

663
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,919
interesting point so um arne as i turn

664
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,760
to you for this question on uh public

665
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
private engagement how you're protecting

666
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
the public sector uh if you can talk

667
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
about supply chain security as well as

668
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,919
and that integration and any efforts

669
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,159
underway uh in germany because i know

670
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,000
that there's been a lot of lines and

671
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,919
work streams in this space that would be

672
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,200
great

673
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,679
yeah sure thank you very much

674
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
so i try to be very sharp first we have

675
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,280
a legislation one had been passed in

676
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,600
2015 the so-called i.t security law 1.0

677
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,679
where we have giving some standards

678
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,440
minimum standards for the critical

679
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,039
infrastructures

680
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,480
we have been done

681
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
the same we've been doing the same in

682
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
2021 where we have large the overall

683
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,480
scope

684
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,200
for example also to the defense industry

685
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
also to a special

686
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,679
let's say a strategic interest for

687
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
germany we are a car nation so of course

688
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
a big car industry is of metric sites

689
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,760
and so on so to protect them especially

690
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
and there we are in quite a high level

691
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,120
of standards there we are getting all

692
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
the reports where they have been

693
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,400
attacked how they have been attacked and

694
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
we can support them so therefore we're

695
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,720
having a very detailed overall

696
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
situational picture and i think this is

697
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
very important for us

698
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,840
number one

699
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
and these are

700
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
hundreds or thousands of companies which

701
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,559
are

702
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,120
somehow let's say fulfilling the minimum

703
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,559
standard of technique

704
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,559
and what is interesting

705
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,720
we we as a government we have a

706
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
procurement power of course

707
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,799
but the big changes coming out of the

708
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,039
industry so what we try to do is to

709
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,799
discuss with the big

710
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,919
the daimlers the bmws and so on folks

711
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,600
fun to discuss with them

712
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
what is the right level of technique

713
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
what suppliers has to fulfill on the

714
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,679
level of information security

715
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,760
like with the thai sex standard and so

716
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,480
on and this is quite working quite well

717
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,200
and this is quite a successor

718
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
then

719
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
we're having a public-private

720
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,080
partnership started with the so-called

721
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,720
alliance for cyber security

722
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,600
and

723
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,360
within the alliance for cyber security

724
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
are participating more than 5 500

725
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,799
companies in germany and this is also

726
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,200
i understood the biggest let's say cyber

727
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,279
security organization was in europe with

728
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,799
these number of companies these are

729
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,799
small medium-sized companies but also

730
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,120
bigger ones and this is creating a kind

731
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,559
of network

732
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,440
of companies to cooperate and how how to

733
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
deal how to react on the kind of

734
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
successful cyber attack and prevent

735
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
it also

736
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,480
and

737
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,279
last but not least uh two areas i i like

738
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,360
to to mention one is

739
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
what we have said is there are lots of

740
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
digitization programs in the government

741
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,919
and for the first time in 21 we said

742
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,760
okay we are going to invest three

743
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,279
billion on the digitization of hospitals

744
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,400
but you can just get money out of this

745
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
three billion as a hospital

746
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
if you are at a minimum investing 15

747
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
percent of it into the level of

748
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
information security and then to state

749
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,960
for the first time that information

750
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
security is a precondition of

751
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
digitization and you have to to invest a

752
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,799
certain kind of amount otherwise you are

753
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,200
not obliged to to participate in this

754
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
kind of government funding

755
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,919
and last but not least what benjamin has

756
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,279
just said

757
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,640
honestly when i'm going into uh i don't

758
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,679
know to

759
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,880
to a seller of a smartphone if i like to

760
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,039
get a new smartphone

761
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,720
you cannot see it now

762
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,279
so um

763
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,520
i will not get any advice how secure it

764
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,240
is

765
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
so therefore this was for us very

766
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
important germany that we also

767
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,240
we want to change the overall market

768
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
that the consumer the end consumer has

769
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
the possibility

770
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,000
to identify how secure is a product

771
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
because then can then he can decide if i

772
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440
want to have a more secure product or a

773
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
less secure product

774
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
and therefore we created the so-called

775
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,440
i.t security labeling first time

776
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,240
starting with messenger uh services

777
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
which we gave to the uh and there then

778
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
for the first time the consumers now can

779
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
decide how secure it is and there's much

780
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
more there on run for example for smart

781
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,039
tv and all the other devices but the end

782
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,760
consumer can decide and with this area

783
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,360
we want to increase the level of

784
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,919
information security and i think this is

785
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,840
our holistic approach in this area

786
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,240
thanks very much rna petr did you want

787
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
to respond to this question i have

788
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
another one for you if i didn't know if

789
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
you wanted to to answer to this one

790
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,559
i'm mostly supporting the other opinions

791
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,799
because we generally think the

792
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,320
the most important key element of

793
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,880
raising the resilient status and

794
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,080
preparedness is in the human factor and

795
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,520
most uh

796
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,320
in most cases the humorous areas are the

797
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
the problems so

798
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,279
in our uh structured cyber statutory

799
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,880
which is under uh the renewment process

800
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,159
uh the k element is is raising awareness

801
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,080
uh also not neglecting technical

802
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,440
preparedness so that's all i can say for

803
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,120
i'll follow up on that because i think

804
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
you know we've talked about human

805
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,559
behavior the human factor as you just

806
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,799
said and there's you know a big issue as

807
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,840
we look globally on the workforce and we

808
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
define what we call a cyber workforce

809
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
which is really you know looking at how

810
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
do we fill these positions i think you

811
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
know i'm of the mindset that cyber

812
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
security is an interdisciplinary issue

813
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
and so when we think about how do we

814
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
bring in diversity of thinking and

815
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,480
innovation going to an earlier point

816
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,320
we've got to be pulling in expertise

817
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
from many disciplines psychology

818
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
sociology history as well as math and

819
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,399
science uh and really getting that

820
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,039
innovation in how we think are there any

821
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
efforts um in workforce development as

822
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
you look at this human piece that you

823
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,039
are focused on or that you've seen that

824
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,559
you think are being particularly

825
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,080
effective as we're really looking to

826
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,640
build out this resilience in the human

827
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
factor

828
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
yes we must if you

829
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,679
educational materials

830
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,559
for for general uses and raising the

831
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,760
education

832
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,320
of the population on the cyber security

833
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,200
field and we must build

834
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,840
connections with the

835
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,720
universities and

836
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,760
and make new uh

837
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,960
educational programs for cyber security

838
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,080
talented

839
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,320
people and and get more in the

840
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,439
government area sorry

841
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
so the education piece is is extremely

842
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
important obviously as we look at

843
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
workforce and how are we building out

844
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
the workforce not just in this moment

845
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
and whether we're re-skilling or

846
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,840
upskilling individuals but how do we

847
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,480
cultivate a workforce with children

848
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,640
today i mean i'm also of the mindset

849
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
that when you know kids are learning how

850
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
to read on a technical device they

851
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,279
should be learning cyber hygiene and

852
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,360
it's integrated into how they look but i

853
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,279
would ask each of you lindy rna benjamin

854
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
as you look at workforce development and

855
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
or the education element of this are

856
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,760
there any initiatives or successes that

857
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,919
you're seeing or challenges that you'd

858
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
like to talk about

859
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,200
aren't they

860
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
yeah sure so so let me

861
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,080
try i'm far above three small children

862
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,240
and everybody says as a digital natives

863
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,760
everybody can understand how to deal

864
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,640
with it

865
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,279
they have no clue about cyber security

866
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,520
they don't know how to behave

867
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
and it's the same when small children

868
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,360
start to go on the street they have to

869
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,960
learn what does it mean when is the

870
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
flashlight red when is it green and what

871
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,399
does it mean

872
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,120
and it's exactly why we

873
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
for the smaller people

874
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,440
that where we intensified started with

875
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,799
the so-called

876
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
school

877
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
bible school book

878
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,640
for uh how how to train

879
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,799
the the children the challenge is the

880
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,880
biggest challenge is the teacher

881
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,039
because they also don't know it either

882
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,519
to how to behave in a digital world

883
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,600
more more securely so this is something

884
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
where we are going to try and start

885
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,240
educational programs and so on

886
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
so the biggest challenge what i see is

887
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,360
when i when i compared to the technology

888
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,640
development

889
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,480
within our staff and in the public

890
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
administration

891
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,799
when i compared to google facebook and

892
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,919
the other ones they invest 20 of their

893
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,200
working time

894
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
to new programs to to to educate their

895
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
own people

896
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,200
can you imagine in the public sector

897
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,159
that we are saying 20 of our time is for

898
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,760
educating the people

899
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,240
our own workforce this means from monday

900
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,480
to thursday we work normally and on

901
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
friday the uh bsi as national cyber

902
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,120
security authority is closed because

903
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,600
everybody has to educate say

904
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,279
and this is something i think we have to

905
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,760
get to overcome and that's why we try to

906
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,799
do lots of training on

907
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,240
webinars

908
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,760
training exercises and so on and very

909
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
important have as peter i think has

910
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
changed they said

911
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,399
very detailed exchanges directly from

912
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,600
bsi

913
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
cooperation directly in the industry

914
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,480
sector or at science sectors and then

915
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,240
after a certain kind of period of two

916
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
months or so and then come back to bsi

917
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,159
and to bring the new learnings new

918
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,000
thinking into bsi

919
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,640
and to to re-educate the staff of bsi so

920
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,799
that we have a much closer exchange i

921
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,480
think you have it's the same person in

922
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,200
the

923
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,039
united states it's a principle of

924
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,799
revolving doors somehow for a certain

925
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,640
period of time that's how we try to move

926
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
forward

927
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,080
thank you

928
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,480
one other yes lindy i was gonna say i

929
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,159
think the other yeah the two major

930
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,559
workforce concerns i have if i can the

931
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,000
first is scale and the second is

932
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,120
diversity

933
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,200
and so in terms of scale i think there

934
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
is just a massive challenge of making

935
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
sure that the education system is

936
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,039
generating the kind of scale of

937
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,399
workforce that we will need for the

938
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,080
digital future that we see

939
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
and i think you know there's just a real

940
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,640
question of the imagination you know of

941
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
the scale of change and how it's you

942
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,000
know ernest three kids um you know we'll

943
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,919
be joined by many others that need to

944
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,200
really have you know have thought about

945
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,240
this as part of their future so we're

946
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,840
certainly thinking about the kind of

947
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,159
stem skills that you need at 11 for

948
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,760
example in a way that means that that

949
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,120
you you could you can choose certain

950
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,399
professions i had a fantastically

951
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,519
inspiring

952
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,080
weekend um at our cyber first girls

953
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
competition in northern ireland a couple

954
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,960
of weeks ago

955
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,320
which is aimed at young teenage girls

956
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,919
who haven't yet made the choices in

957
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,320
their education and system of what to do

958
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,480
so we we have a chance to to help them

959
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,679
imagine the possibility and the

960
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,200
excitement of some of the things that

961
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,799
they could do both in their education

962
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
but also their natural future possible

963
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,000
careers and it was the most inspiring

964
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
bunch of people i've hung out with for a

965
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,440
long time and we do that partly because

966
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,799
the challenge is not just scale it is

967
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
also diversity if we simply replicate

968
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,799
the workforce that we currently have and

969
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,080
i think that's particularly true in the

970
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,679
national security side but it's also

971
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
true actually in tech in general we will

972
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
end up missing the opportunity of half

973
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,360
the population

974
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
the world of computing was dominated by

975
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,640
women very early on and i'd like to see

976
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,480
frankly a bit of re-leveling to ensure

977
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,320
that it's a bit more equitable as we go

978
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,399
forward and yeah that's not just in

979
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,760
terms of gender we also need to make

980
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
sure that cyber security is reflective

981
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,120
of the populations that we have as a

982
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,119
whole in terms of geography in terms of

983
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,040
ethnicity yeah and i think in terms of

984
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
you know observations and behaviors and

985
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
so so i really want to make sure that we

986
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,320
don't simply recruit our own image we

987
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
actually think about a much wider set of

988
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,079
potential recruits and for this industry

989
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,918
in the future

990
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,760
i think that is such a critical element

991
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
diversity is just its diversity of

992
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,800
thinking it's one of the efforts that

993
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,359
we've prioritized here at cisa because

994
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,679
it's very much about not just gender and

995
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,520
race diversity it's socioeconomic

996
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,599
cultural background we're launching a

997
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
neurodiversity program because to your

998
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,839
earlier point about innovation if we're

999
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,359
truly looking to innovate we have to

1000
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,520
think about these problems differently

1001
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,199
i'll share a quick anecdote about our

1002
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,199
united states agency for international

1003
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,560
development they were building out an

1004
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
ebola suit for healthcare workers and

1005
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,719
they did an audition and they ended up

1006
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,079
bringing in a woman who was a wedding

1007
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,918
dress designer because she understood

1008
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,920
breathability of fabric and movement and

1009
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
all these elements and i think it was

1010
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
just a great example of how we've got to

1011
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,480
be thinking about

1012
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,400
these problems and these issues

1013
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
differently and also

1014
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
pulling off of other sectors and so i

1015
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,680
think that's a critical piece um

1016
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,119
benjamin did you have your hand raised

1017
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
for this for this question

1018
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,320
oh just something that ernest said which

1019
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,400
so for the young people we've definitely

1020
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
had a government-funded program to look

1021
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,720
at the sg cyber youth program to reach

1022
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
out to the young and career mentoring as

1023
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,079
well

1024
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,480
for senior cyber people to mentor the

1025
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
young people to help them along the way

1026
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,079
but we also know that this is going to

1027
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,560
be a long game and in the meantime we've

1028
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,520
really spent a lot of time on

1029
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,440
re-skilling a lot of government funding

1030
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
for re-skilling and every citizen has

1031
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,400
been given a certain amount of money to

1032
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,640
go for additional courses

1033
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,680
and so that's really really been helpful

1034
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
and one of the things of course is that

1035
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,359
to

1036
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,760
train people up in this

1037
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,240
the cyber security agency has shown

1038
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,839
led the way because

1039
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,200
it's populated by people with

1040
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,280
backgrounds not just in computer science

1041
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,119
and information security or military

1042
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
cyber ops but also with history degrees

1043
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,440
with sociology degrees and

1044
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,599
all kinds of backgrounds

1045
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,760
in the cyber security agency so that

1046
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,960
helps

1047
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
it's a wonderful point because they do

1048
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,160
think it's about how do we make this

1049
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,640
field accessible uh and how do we help

1050
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
mentor and and really guide uh

1051
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,280
individuals and commend the work that

1052
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
each of you is doing in this space with

1053
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,720
with organizations that are really

1054
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
looking to build young talent and

1055
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
building out our younger workforce um

1056
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,000
unfortunately we're getting close to

1057
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
wrapping up i do want to ask an

1058
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
important question for this particular

1059
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,480
group which is we've talked about each

1060
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,280
of your individual efforts um and what

1061
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
you're doing but as was mentioned at the

1062
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
outset cyber security offers a

1063
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,400
tremendous opportunity for bilateral and

1064
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,640
multilateral cooperation and we talked

1065
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,880
about somebody we were thinking through

1066
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,119
this international norms and standards

1067
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
what do you think the priorities for

1068
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,280
multilateral collaboration and

1069
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,040
cooperation and cyber security should be

1070
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
or what are the efforts that we should

1071
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,760
be focusing on uh in this moment

1072
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
and peter i'll i'll turn it over to you

1073
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,560
well i think all the man all cyber

1074
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,359
security elements are are very important

1075
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,760
and we have a

1076
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,680
multi-level approach

1077
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,960
regarding the corporation it must tackle

1078
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,119
the detection prevention mitigation

1079
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,040
restoration problems best practices and

1080
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,880
we must have a

1081
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,320
regular coordination goals regarding the

1082
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
incidents and and uh and in in evil eu

1083
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,240
eu level anisa and international

1084
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,000
adversity and so

1085
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
we have we must have

1086
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
cooperation groups for information

1087
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
sharing and the better information

1088
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,839
sharing

1089
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,839
internationally

1090
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,279
thank you uh arne

1091
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,800
sorry for finding the mic so quickly so

1092
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,359
very uh for me very very easy i think

1093
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,960
we're having very good information

1094
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,480
sharing on the technical level for

1095
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,160
example with the c cert network and all

1096
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,400
this kind of area i think it's working

1097
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
great

1098
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
um i think it is a great for example

1099
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,720
that the white house for example started

1100
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
the kind of let's say discussions

1101
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,480
regarding ransomware on these kind of

1102
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,960
different how to tackle these areas i

1103
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,280
think this is also great

1104
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,920
and what i love to see is not because

1105
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,839
cyber security is currently on the top

1106
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,599
of the list of everybody that everybody

1107
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,160
starts to do to create something new

1108
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,400
but more or less stay with the existing

1109
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
ones and makes it more professionally

1110
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,800
gives them the right resources and these

1111
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,599
kind of areas and when i look to our

1112
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,880
friends here

1113
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,040
with everybody on the call and even much

1114
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,960
more we are cooperating very closely and

1115
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,200
i think this has to be intensified we

1116
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
see people who also bring something on

1117
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
the table not just getting something but

1118
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
bring really something on the table but

1119
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
i think this is very important to have

1120
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,320
sierra with a like-minded

1121
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
people nations

1122
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
a very close cooperation

1123
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,359
thank you i think that point about

1124
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
like-minded economic partners and allies

1125
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,839
is so critical um

1126
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,920
benjamin the good news for asean is that

1127
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,280
asean was the first region to adopt the

1128
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,119
2015 ungge cyber norms and the asean

1129
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,400
member states appointed singapore to

1130
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,640
take the lead in helping to build out

1131
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,880
the operationalization of the norms so

1132
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,640
we're pretty optimistic about that we've

1133
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
actually had the singapore asean

1134
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,240
singapore cyber center of excellence

1135
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,640
which my center also does a lot of work

1136
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,440
with to build capacity among the asean

1137
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,280
nations and with a lot of help and

1138
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
cooperation with us with the uk with

1139
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,440
netherlands and japan and also within

1140
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,520
depaul to really build capacity among

1141
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
asean member states so we're really

1142
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,720
looking forward to more of that

1143
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,599
cooperation in the years to come

1144
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,400
thank you and and lindy to you on how we

1145
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
should prioritize

1146
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,000
bilateral multilateral cooperation when

1147
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
we look at cyber security and and the

1148
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,400
work and the efforts of the uk

1149
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,920
thanks i mean i think our national cyber

1150
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,560
strategy is clear that we not only see

1151
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,599
international engagement as an

1152
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,280
absolutely key part of our own cyber

1153
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,040
security but also actually that we can

1154
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,200
see as key to our broader foreign policy

1155
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,400
so i think it's very much at the heart

1156
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,760
of it is no longer a sort of you know a

1157
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,440
marginalized issue and for me the

1158
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
absolute criticality here is thinking

1159
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,319
about the ethics and values behind this

1160
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,720
as technology changes as democracies we

1161
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,240
need to think about the kind of values

1162
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,680
that we want to see encoded into that

1163
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,839
technology and make sure that the kind

1164
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,000
of security we put around that reflects

1165
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,520
you know what our citizens expect you

1166
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,280
know the kind of freedom of speech that

1167
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
they want the kind of ability to operate

1168
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,440
in their lives to take advantage of

1169
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,200
opportunities as well as to feel they

1170
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
can protect themselves adequately and i

1171
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,200
think there's something really

1172
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,319
fundamental about how we do that as

1173
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,119
democracies going forward

1174
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,040
thank you so much because i do think

1175
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,720
that would be another discussion that

1176
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,160
would be wonderful is how we look at

1177
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,720
ethics and innovation and you know how

1178
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,560
we're prioritizing security and all of

1179
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,000
these these elements which is so

1180
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,079
critical as we are focusing on human

1181
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,920
behavior but focusing on this innovation

1182
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
on the other piece and

1183
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,040
this has been a fantastic discussion and

1184
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,800
as i expected i wish we had a lot more

1185
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
time i'm very grateful to each of you

1186
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
for the the work and certainly for your

1187
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,760
service um on this issue and for how

1188
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,680
creative and thoughtful and deliberate

1189
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,040
each of you is in your role and i think

1190
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,400
you know thinking through as we've

1191
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,240
discussed this importance of human

1192
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,480
behavior of technology and innovation

1193
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,400
how we secure supply chains and use

1194
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,720
governments as a real force multiplier

1195
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,960
for action when it comes to supply chain

1196
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,119
and being able to operationalize that

1197
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,359
with industry and then importantly how

1198
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,920
we're looking across the globe for

1199
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,400
like-minded partners like-minded allies

1200
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
as we're building out cooperation and

1201
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,480
standards and approaches to how to

1202
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,400
secure the global economy and create a

1203
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
more resilient infrastructure so to rna

1204
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
to benjamin to painter and to lindy

1205

discussion
