2
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,219
what I want to talk about is artificial

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,910
intelligence and the question is we in

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,440
the last panel in the last discussion

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,020
and presentations we already talked

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,740
about that cybersecurity becomes more

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,800
and more challenging and for sure

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,240
artificial intelligence will change the

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,849
game again it will change the game from

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,059
two sides first of all when we think

11
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,570
about where the cybersecurity topic come

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,760
from it's not only from email it's

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,980
coming from IOT it is coming from

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,840
whatever is connected on this world

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,640
artificial intelligence will drive and

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,360
enable a complete new set of connected

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,870
devices artificial intelligence will

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,510
also enable a different type of things

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,910
the Machine and when thinking about

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,680
artificial intelligence artificial

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,460
intelligence is not good not bad so you

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,080
can use it in two ways

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,490
it can be the attacker of tomorrow as

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,750
well as the defender so the question is

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,360
how do we deal with artificial

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,500
intelligence in this way so first of all

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,330
I'm pretty sure artificial intelligence

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,680
will help to support schemes for with

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,470
say attacking learning how to find out

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,189
passwords how to change very quickly the

31
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,619
approach on fishing and many other sites

32
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,229
I think that's pretty obvious so the

33
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,540
question is what we have to discuss how

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,930
to deal with this on the other side

35
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,790
artificial intelligence can also be of

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,750
great benefit artificial intelligence

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,619
can supervise what is going on the in

38
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,380
the internet what is going on in the

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,909
data exchange environment and then from

40
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,300
these peten make proposals on potential

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,760
problem it can help the people who are

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
responsible for the defense

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,040
of the companies but we also talked

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,830
about the normal people on road the

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,530
normal people who like me and others who

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,310
are happy to get some more IOT devices

47
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,800
which help them in life which are making

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,340
life easy art IOT is about a matter of

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,780
ease-of-use IOT years and artificial

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,989
intelligence is instrumental on this if

51
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,269
you would go so for that we think about

52
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,030
the collaborative robot at home

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,430
artificial intelligence there'll be the

54
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,810
key engine in it

55
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,310
and to be very honest I'm not so sure if

56
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,959
and we debated today we should program

57
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,299
however they do our software diligently

58
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,390
I'm not too sure how trained to how to

59
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,230
train an AI in a diligent manner so a

60
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,390
lot of topics are coming up there but

61
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,360
they will come now there was another

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,569
question how to deal with as an average

63
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,859
person to this problem I fully agree

64
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,380
that we need to be significantly more of

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,450
the heir of what it means on cyber

66
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,310
security but I give you a picture where

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,370
I believe it is it will not work so

68
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,000
easily when you do your driver's license

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
normally you learn besides many other

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,340
things you should take care for the

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,400
pressure in your tires there had been a

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,549
phase where we had a lot of rollover

73
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,030
accidents in as in us with the SUVs why

74
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,060
because of deflated tires and what

75
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,489
happened there was a ruling that you

76
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,040
have to build in by the company's a tire

77
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
pressure monitor so for me the big

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,579
question is when I look at cyber

79
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,890
security at the cyber space how to deal

80
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,400
with this and in many other areas then

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,600
how can we first of all think about the

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,228
right ruling the right ease of use for

83
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,820
the end customer because if you have a

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,280
tire pressure monitor you will not

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,780
forget you will not think about dirty

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,450
fingers you will get the

87
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,490
Carville tell you you have to go to the

88
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,730
station and take care of work so AI can

89
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,030
be a crucial role on this hey I can help

90
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,180
in order to highlight if it detects

91
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,140
problems that to the end-users that they

92
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,170
should take care for on the other side

93
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,690
in order to make that happen we have to

94
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,620
think ourselves how do we enable our IOT

95
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,220
devices our infrastructure in a way that

96
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,880
this can be done reasonably well if you

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,610
have an unsecured item from the very

98
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,790
beginning you don't need even to observe

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,450
it just take it out of the network I'll

100
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,010
take it out of some relevant I would say

101
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,460
communication I personally would be

102
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,920
extremely happy if I would see such a

103
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,770
surveillance program which would if I

104
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,870
receive an email and the name and the

105
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,230
email whatever it comes true or not has

106
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,170
a color green yellow red green or

107
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,030
something where obviously this person

108
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,730
has identified all the device identified

109
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,490
itself from the very beginning and when

110
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,710
I think about IOT I even do not think

111
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,990
about the people writing emails the IOT

112
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,320
device well it's not so difficult when

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,180
you think about we have a lot of devices

114
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,450
today where we say yeah we can have a

115
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,990
secured Hardware we have that in the

116
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,670
phone we have that in the banking card

117
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,270
it is an anchor there you start with you

118
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,330
identify your device and go on from

119
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,150
there so if this device becomes yellow

120
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,360
what you can take it out of many

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,360
activities if it becomes red you may

122
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,930
think about to block it in the whole

123
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,960
communication area so again here

124
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,690
ease-of-use metals in two ways first

125
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,240
ease-of-use fools those who design

126
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,280
products I think you can ask for a very

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,850
high quality software but this is not so

128
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,450
easy to do we can develop a hundred

129
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,750
percent reliable software but maybe we

130
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,370
can't at least we

131
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,540
on the way think about automotive

132
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,490
functional safety requires that you can

133
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,729
develop software which is from the first

134
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:54,600
moment totally functional that even in a

135
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,120
case of a non-functional element there

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,840
is a fallback so basically we can if we

137
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,020
want but the question is can we afford

138
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,490
and I don't think we can afford so we

139
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,979
have to think about in two ways how to

140
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:13,620
use AI to create a surveillance and how

141
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,350
to make things easier for the people who

142
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,770
design IOT devices who design software

143
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,210
and at least for the user in order to

144
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,210
that and here I believe artificial

145
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,630
intelligence can help a lot how to use

146
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,690
it and how to get informed about what is

147
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,860
going on and what is off many of us are

148
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,830
using in their PC a virus scanner you

149
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,690
now can believe it or not but it's on

150
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,389
you some people put it off but I think

151
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:45,960
here

152
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,099
nevertheless it is running my not having

153
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,280
these topics in your software in order

154
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,479
to help his room because my expectation

155
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,889
is not that people are hesitant to go

156
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,030
and use new gadgets to be I would say

157
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,970
keen to have IOT but they will not

158
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,699
understand what is going on when you buy

159
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,830
a car I also tune would ask you to think

160
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,330
about the software which is in your

161
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,340
engine management in order to make sure

162
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,590
you know what what is going on in the

163
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,550
exhaust or whatever I think here it is

164
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,099
true V and there I that we have to

165
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,440
expect more but we have to make it more

166
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,339
easy now I come to one point talking

167
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,049
about these identities nobody debated if

168
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,339
it was meaningful to have the icon which

169
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,250
is kind of encoding the name of an

170
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,440
address which you know somehow into a

171
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,250
number why not having similar ways done

172
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,650
on a public-private partnership or even

173
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,950
on a part pop and

174
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,720
cooperation level in order to provide

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,250
services where the people might be

176
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,100
willing to pay for of course the idea to

177
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,900
have us incentive in order to highlight

178
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,740
vulnerabilities by the way it already

179
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,460
exists to a certain degree makes also

180
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,850
sense but again I believe artificial

181
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,550
intelligence will change the game

182
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,860
significantly on the attack and the

183
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
defense side so the question is what do

184
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,830
we do early enough to enable artificial

185
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,870
intelligence on the defense side in

186
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,380
order to provide a reasonably of as a

187
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,360
system which you can handle where you

188
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,330
can think about additional value being

189
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,540
created and by the way again a lot is

190
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,480
there the only point is how to put it

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,520
together in an overall working system

192
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,120
and to make a move on that so I think

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,270
with this I want to conclude and I'm

194
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,460
looking forward to see the going on on

195
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,540
the further discussion

196
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,490
and my question is again for this and I

197
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,800
administer stable she is a one who is

198
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,710
advertising a lot I think we should in

199
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,810
general think about how to help instead

200
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,690
of how to raise the finger with this

201
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,190
thank you very much

202
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:26,490
