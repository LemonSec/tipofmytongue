2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,969
my name is marina Boyer and and I'm at

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,010
the moment the chair chair of the global

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,330
Commission on stability of cyberspace

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,730
I'm former Estonian foreign minister and

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,580
cyber came into my life in 2007 when

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,230
during the cyber attacks I was a student

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,090
ambassador to Russia and had to deal in

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,470
practical terms with International

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,390
Cooperation I'm a strong believer in

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,980
International Cooperation although we

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,100
didn't work then please kitty my name is

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,930
Katie my Soros I'm the founder and CEO

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,360
of luta Security I'll try and include

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,150
this half of the room as well I work

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,260
with governments and large organizations

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,890
to create programs to deal with

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,740
vulnerability reports whether you are

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,570
paying a bug bounty or not we'll touch

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,000
on that a bit later but I've also helped

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,280
my government and the European

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,040
governments on thinking about how do you

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,520
how do you create a more flexible work

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,399
force in terms of cybersecurity and what

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,009
are some of the policy creations that

26
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,829
some regulators have made that in fact

27
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,170
started out as good ideas but the devil

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,150
is in the details so I've had to help

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,979
undo things that we're a little

30
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,600
overzealous such as the Wassenaar

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,010
arrangement how many of you have heard

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,530
of that in in the regulation of this

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,840
space in order to not over regulate

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,970
defenders as you are trying to protect

35
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,159
and control the proliferation of cyber

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,560
weapons perfect maria afternoon i'm the

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,140
CEO for the cyber defense alliance or a

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,570
non-profit public-private partnership we

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,510
focus in the financial industry we take

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,790
information we shared industrialized

41
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,189
levels we take that information and turn

42
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,570
it into actionable intelligence

43
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,460
something that we can use to stop

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,890
something from happening in industry we

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,140
also do intelligence reports that are

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,490
actionable that we give to law

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,409
enforcement so that they can go out

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,840
seize assets seized funds and make

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,630
arrests we're extremely tactical works

50
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,189
opera who have operationalized

51
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:10,679
everything or extremely strategic

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,750
because we're helping to build maturity

53
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,650
levels across the the members across the

54
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,749
sector as far as you know raising

55
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:21,120
maturity levels raising resilience

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,129
an accelerated preparedness against

57
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:26,549
cyber crime in cyber threats Thank You

58
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,150
Mariana andreas yeah andreas kun I'm the

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,890
leader of the department for cyber and

60
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,349
information security within the German

61
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,900
Department of the Interior building and

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,150
community and so we are working on the

63
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,090
cyber security architecture in Germany

64
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,959
the forthcoming IT security law the

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,079
cooperation with industry and last but

66
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:55,799
not least to immediately come up with

67
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,930
the question of research on research in

68
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,079
cyber security and to enforce more and

69
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,530
new ideas thank you thank you well my

70
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,079
name is Raul Driscoll I work for the

71
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,239
Spanish cybersecurity Institute is a

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,209
national governmental t-shirt and we

73
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,609
worked to protect different

74
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,109
constituencies they are very different

75
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:17,159
from each other

76
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,680
so citizens companies a critical

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,959
infrastructure I am the former head of

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,390
research and development and I'm working

79
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,730
in intelligence as well as industrial

80
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,540
control systems and I was co-chair in

81
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,880
European Commission and IES platform who

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,639
delivered the research roadmap and now

83
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,579
and and then became on exo which is the

84
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,500
European cyber security organizations I

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,629
was part of the board member of the

86
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,180
board so I think this is more or less

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,560
describe my experience

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,019
thank you wrong so before we starting

89
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,669
and stepping into the discussion I would

90
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,790
like to do a poll and I would like to

91
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,010
ask you one question do you feel that

92
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,730
the cyberspace is already over regulated

93
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:06,419
yes hands up not a single hand as Hanna

94
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,859
so Marina even one okay so we will

95
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,299
definitely have some questions for us

96
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,090
later on so but I would like to start

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,000
with marina first of call of all I feel

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,310
some time frustrated because if you see

99
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,090
the national protectionism and also the

100
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,000
organizational silos we working in I

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,669
feel sometimes this is almost impossible

102
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,740
to have a multi-stakeholder governance

103
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,860
in place globally so

104
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,229
not a waste of time - speaking on on

105
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:41,099
this topic nowadays before I go to the

106
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,379
question I'd like to say how proud I am

107
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,229
on a panel with so many ladies I think

108
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,090
that we are the most gender balance

109
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,969
panel Katie oh my I think I know for a

110
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:56,009
long time now but because diplomas they

111
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,419
never answer the questions they say what

112
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,789
they want to say and so I thought but

113
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:04,530
committed question I think what we need

114
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,860
today is clarity because we all are

115
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,469
using the same words we are talking

116
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:14,969
about open free accessible data use of

117
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,479
ICTs we are talking about

118
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,529
multi-stakeholder model a model and

119
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,479
inclusiveness but what do we mean by

120
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,680
that hmm each Chinese internet as free

121
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,699
as it is in Estonia question mark so I

122
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,250
think that we need clarity and here we

123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,990
need international law and we need nodes

124
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,639
I'm a lawyer by the education and then

125
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,110
that moment I'm a politician so we

126
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,699
understand the difference between

127
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,620
international law and political norms

128
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,259
but I also know that so far we haven't

129
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,169
been able to agree on how international

130
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,300
law applies to cyber we'll go to the

131
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,669
conference's and repeat international

132
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,460
law applies to cyber but how we haven't

133
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,560
answered it means we don't have clarity

134
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,589
there and maybe through nomes through

135
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,900
additional regulations we can start

136
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,860
answering how exact what are the norms

137
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,659
how to behave because we need clarity

138
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:12,509
what is allowed what is not what happens

139
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,629
if somebody violates multi-stakeholder I

140
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:20,099
also think that we are we are close to

141
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,289
understanding it's crucial and important

142
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,659
and I would say that for me maybe the

143
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,270
document that proves that was the Paris

144
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,909
call which was introduced by President

145
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,069
McCrone celebrating the 100th

146
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,740
anniversary after the of the victory of

147
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,020
the first of the end of the first world

148
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,169
war which was signed by close to four

149
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,759
500 participants among them states

150
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,399
industry civil society NGO so I see that

151
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,870
there is appetite

152
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,539
but again the future and the coming

153
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,879
future in the United Nations and in

154
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,639
other organizations will show how we

155
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,180
will be able to take multi-stakeholder

156
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,479
model inclusiveness from nice slogans to

157
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,650
practical cooperation

158
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,479
yeah that would leads me to a question

159
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,659
to Andres and actually I had a very

160
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,400
interesting report in my hands from

161
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,349
Norwich Tifton I found what emerge

162
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,110
system and they had a study about 50

163
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,300
organization or so and that's just in

164
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,370
Germany are handling the topic cyber

165
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,379
right we talked about this previously

166
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,740
and my question is is there not so much

167
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,279
level of a conflict of interest having

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,319
this organization in place and having

169
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,599
silos talking maybe not to each other

170
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,969
how to solve actually that operational

171
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:41,099
issue clearly we need communication for

172
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,009
that and so what we did is establishing

173
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,219
the German Cyber Response Center clearly

174
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,319
there are 50 organizations but it

175
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,339
depends on the fact that we have 16

176
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,370
several states in Germany and that's

177
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,060
part of our constitutional system to do

178
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,759
it that way that the federal states in

179
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,270
some responsibility for cyberspace and

180
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,689
so that anyone has to fill its own

181
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,180
obligations then if you do it that way

182
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,149
and it was a really effective system

183
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,729
during the last 70 years in Germany

184
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,909
brought as freedom and prosperity so we

185
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,360
have to find a way to communicate and to

186
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,969
make a fortune all of that that's not

187
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,069
easy clearly there are many things

188
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,259
lacking at the moment for example it's

189
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,589
not so easy to bring in for example the

190
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,870
federal states in the communication of

191
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,809
police forces no less we have to do it

192
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,360
and we did it organized that way for

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,850
good reasons mm-hmm I had also chat

194
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,610
about this was Rowell and and you also

195
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,000
have an initiative running in Spain and

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,350
actually concluded that the silo

197
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,480
breakdown is one of the major issue we

198
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
have to face what have you done actually

199
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,250
in Spain in order to get this out of the

200
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,520
way

201
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,310
well we realized that at the end we all

202
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,180
share common goals no matter if for sure

203
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,730
there are also different outcomes and

204
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,190
but we should be focused on that so we

205
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,230
made an experiment and now become a way

206
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,529
of working I think that we reset the way

207
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,380
of working because the parity that we

208
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,910
are what we lived until today was part

209
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,970
of that so a lot of people with

210
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,540
different ideas but common goals met met

211
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,850
together and then decided the

212
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,330
Constitution or whatever so we agreed to

213
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,959
sit down

214
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,360
even competitors between between them so

215
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,390
big companies startups companies and so

216
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,440
on and we realized that after you know

217
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,010
we make some dynamics as the government

218
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,430
to you know start these kind of

219
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,410
discussions then we got an agreement on

220
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,579
30 initiatives that were common for

221
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,709
everyone and we were interesting to put

222
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,160
resources on them at the end even in

223
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,950
those who seems to be just interesting

224
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,430
force small companies who stood up at

225
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,529
the end were interested also for the

226
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,459
large company I put an example we

227
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,300
launched a cybersecurity initiative for

228
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,029
creating new startups it was a hundred

229
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,180
percent public initiative large

230
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,610
companies didn't care about it but then

231
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,120
when those were meeting different

232
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,829
investors from different countries they

233
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,890
say ok but what I have to done with this

234
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,010
investment I am interested on on it so

235
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,230
even large company were interested on

236
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,959
this so for sure there are different and

237
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,630
hundreds of initiatives that for example

238
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,670
making some kind of research studies

239
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,970
it's up to each of them to use it

240
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,370
differently or not but at the end all of

241
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,660
them were interested in this kind of

242
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,090
research so why not put effort together

243
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,300
try to get something that probably we

244
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,660
all sell a shirt and then you know today

245
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,180
it's working so for sure it would be

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,450
better and but let's reset or mine

247
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,570
because all of them wants to do good

248
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,180
things and we sit down not only company

249
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,410
but also researchers hacking conferences

250
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,190
as well

251
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,560
so this is different venture capitalists

252
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,460
and so on it was very difficult but it

253
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,280
was dialogue dialogue after one after

254
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,860
another and I think that we all agreed

255
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,160
on this kind of strategic plan so for me

256
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,870
it's um quite important marina you you

257
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,780
mentioned the Paris call and at the

258
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,180
Paris call you have the IGF as well the

259
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,310
the internet governments forum you

260
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,840
mentioned in other forums we have in

261
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,390
place who should be actually responsible

262
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,580
to bring all these initiatives together

263
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,270
yeah who is a global you you named

264
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,070
yourself as a global Commission for

265
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,740
cyber stability but how should these

266
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,130
dialogue really go into the nation in

267
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,030
order to get the national views on etc

268
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,770
always roots have their answer today but

269
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,660
I know that there are discussions going

270
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,610
on at for example secretary-general of

271
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,620
the United Nations called high-level

272
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,200
panel to look exactly at that how to

273
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,140
bridge the different frameworks that are

274
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,790
happening as much as I know there are

275
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,250
about 100 international cybersecurity

276
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,590
dialogues which is good we're raising

277
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,900
awareness but now it's time to start

278
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,500
cooperating and so I'm really looking at

279
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
the work of the high-level panel which

280
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,220
will come out with recommendations also

281
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,680
how to bridge different topics how to

282
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,020
bridge different institutions but I

283
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,970
don't think that in the end there's

284
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,430
going to be one responsible there will

285
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,320
be state responsibilities government

286
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,390
responsibilities which will be the

287
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,880
centerpiece in cooperation with others

288
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,210
and Maria you you have a close

289
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,370
cooperation also with the Europol

290
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,160
and your counter fighting fraud

291
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,500
obviously how's that actually working

292
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,820
what is the government's actually for

293
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,640
your institution with public

294
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,990
institutions how do you deal with them

295
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,870
so it's working extremely well but I

296
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,630
it's working well because you have

297
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,730
like-minded people that have a common

298
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,470
goal and no one cares who gets the

299
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,980
credit

300
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,770
so everybody realizes that leave your

301
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,850
ego at the door

302
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,850
the enemies on the outside let's all

303
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,830
work together for a common goal and we

304
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,900
work with law enforcement you know they

305
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,880
they work with us they're in the same

306
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,310
you know offices with us they're in and

307
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,740
out we have the banks sitting there so

308
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,050
all the banks have a seconded employee

309
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,160
that sits there

310
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,470
our team sits there you know so

311
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,020
constantly we're building trust and you

312
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,790
know we talked about trust and I think

313
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,770
you have to earn trust and you can't

314
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,510
ever break that trust so it's working

315
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,890
because you have people with that are

316
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,610
like-minded

317
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,000
that know that this is a systemic and

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,470
it's a global problem and it's an

319
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,210
epidemic proportion and it's not just

320
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,490
financial I meant financial I think you

321
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,959
know we talked about research and

322
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,940
development we talked about you know

323
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,890
some of the merger and acquisitions and

324
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,470
I think you know it's we need so we need

325
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,540
do need norms and we do need you know to

326
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,570
earn trust but how do you do that when

327
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,279
you have countries that protect the

328
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,870
people the very people that are

329
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,540
attacking us but it does work when it

330
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,950
does and it works we've been able to

331
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,709
prevent DDoS attacks because we're

332
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,240
sharing intelligence sharing information

333
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,180
you know two banks got ransom notes one

334
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,430
bank that threatened to ddos the other

335
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,320
bank started one of them started getting

336
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,930
ddosed the other bank did not you know

337
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,260
we but we took all the information the

338
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,360
type of attack you know the specifics

339
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,490
around it the technology around it

340
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,380
architectures topologies all those

341
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,690
things the other banks you know went

342
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,370
away and they changed their architecture

343
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,200
so they made changes in their topologies

344
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
and by doing that you know one bank and

345
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,000
I earn fifty minutes before the same

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
attack or attacked they had just made

347
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,130
some changes and it was a non-event so

348
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,670
we can do this so what only concerns me

349
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,850
is actually this sharing of information

350
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,680
and fighting against fraud is fantastic

351
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,720
but when we talk about vulnerabilities

352
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,290
and

353
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,310
exploits etc I just sitting next to the

354
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,170
bounty queen and first of all you have

355
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,120
to explain us what the bounty queen

356
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,610
means and then I would like to share

357
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,700
some thoughts with you

358
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,230
vulnerabilities and exploits are still

359
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,360
weaponized right they're still being

360
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,390
used by nation states and in violent non

361
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,050
nation states how we can create trust if

362
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,110
there's not a frame or part of a norm

363
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,480
how to deal with that

364
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,850
okay so first to answer your question I

365
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,400
think I've earned that title bounty

366
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,770
queen because I convinced Microsoft who

367
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,110
had publicly pledged to never pay for

368
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,940
vulnerabilities and just start their own

369
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,330
bug bounty program in 2013 and that was

370
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,730
over three years of preparation because

371
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,440
I was a strategist at Microsoft but I

372
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,840
was using the data that we had to

373
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,790
predict how can we make this more

374
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,800
efficient and more win-win for both

375
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,560
sides at the time Microsoft was

376
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,530
receiving over 200,000 non-spam email

377
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,660
messages a year of people trying to

378
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,420
report security bugs for free over

379
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,260
200,000 today with six years of bug

380
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,750
bounty under their belt they still

381
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,340
receive about the same amount so it

382
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,470
wasn't about increasing the reports it

383
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,750
was about using the data that we had and

384
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,060
using incentives to target those

385
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,190
friendly eyes so to your point about the

386
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,140
different markets there is an offense

387
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,520
market some people call it the black

388
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,070
market for vulnerabilities and exploits

389
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,840
there is a there is a purpose and a use

390
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,819
for this market that is lawful and

391
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,619
legitimate you know you don't

392
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,630
necessarily call people who work in the

393
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,369
intelligence community inherently evil

394
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,760
if they make use of these weapons it's a

395
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,890
matter of finding ways to balance the

396
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,869
equities across having to defend your

397
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,390
critical infrastructure and having to

398
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,030
have some weapons available to use to

399
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,369
target criminals terrorist organizations

400
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,709
etc unfortunately these weapons can be

401
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,280
abused

402
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,160
hence the oversight requirements but

403
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,780
when we think about how do we use these

404
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,170
bounty incentives most productively it

405
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,180
really does come down to not how they

406
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,250
are being used today and this was why I

407
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,720
was calling attention to the fact that

408
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,120
just slap a bounty on it and and you

409
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,200
know you can solve all these problems

410
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,490
that turns this into a very

411
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,250
transactional event of identifying

412
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,340
security holes and you can easily

413
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,760
corrupt that you know well-intentioned

414
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,659
acquisition of vulnerabilities for

415
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,580
defensive purposes and you can create

416
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,799
perverse incentives one of the bug

417
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,690
bounty platforms actually boasts that

418
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,539
you can make sixteen times as much at

419
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,059
living in India being a bug bounty

420
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,549
hunter then you can living in India

421
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,870
being a software developer

422
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,210
where do we outsource a lot of software

423
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,690
development especially for IOT right so

424
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,809
Dilbert had a cartoon about this in 1995

425
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,580
where that you know they said we're

426
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,019
gonna start a bug bounty and someone

427
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,730
said I'm gonna write myself a minivan

428
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,330
right in code so the jokes been there

429
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,610
forever but now we are seeing the crest

430
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,070
of that becoming a potential reality so

431
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,360
one of the things that was also

432
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,149
mentioned was about the European Union

433
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,220
funding bug bounties against open source

434
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,539
software they're used in European

435
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,750
government now the right idea was there

436
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,049
we need to support open source security

437
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,880
however it was almost like the

438
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,769
prescription was written for bug bounty

439
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,720
before the doctor came in to diagnose

440
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,450
the patient you know and actually the

441
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,460
maintainer zuv open source security need

442
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,380
more support so a lot of people thought

443
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,519
well why don't we just make that

444
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,769
transactional as well just pay for the

445
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,320
fixes double down well it turns out I

446
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,480
asked the Apache server core maintainer

447
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,029
of which there are a handful less than

448
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,340
five who were paid full time to maintain

449
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,889
Apache server core I asked them would it

450
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,840
help you number one did you know the EU

451
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,220
was about to bound to you and they said

452
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,529
no thanks for telling us that was number

453
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,899
one number two I said would it help if

454
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,580
we doubled the bounty if someone

455
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,279
supplied a fix a working fix and they

456
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,889
said please God don't do that because we

457
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,539
already spend an inordinate amount of

458
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,269
time arguing about breaking changes when

459
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:37,950
someone tries to introduce a fix and

460
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,480
they are not familiar enough with the

461
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,130
architecture so what we really need to

462
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,750
be creating in terms of defensive

463
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,370
incentives that are sustainable

464
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,190
especially an open-source is not create

465
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,500
the mirror image transactional you know

466
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,799
find a bug submit a fix but we actually

467
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,779
need to think about our labor pipeline

468
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:57,299
why do open-source maintainer x' do what

469
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,679
they do why are there so many volunteers

470
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,850
in

471
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,370
creating incentives to point out bugs

472
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,990
have we actually ended up gutting our

473
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,460
pipeline for the future maintainer x'

474
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,730
the future of keeping those those open

475
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,070
source systems secure so I can talk a

476
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,780
lot more about that but you did ask only

477
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,350
two questions thank you and certainly a

478
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,020
role you taking care about industry

479
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,679
control systems a new research and

480
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,179
previously we talked about supply chain

481
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,960
and obviously many of the ICS topics are

482
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,690
part of a huge supply chain how does it

483
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,909
make sense talking about bounty programs

484
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,620
and supply chain who's actually

485
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,510
coordinating is there any governance to

486
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,270
coordinate vulnerabilities across value

487
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,090
chain how do you progress in that space

488
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,580
I think that the basis is is different

489
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,400
worse because of the the words said by

490
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,640
Siemens this morning so they have to

491
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,640
support between 15 20 years its new

492
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,250
product they delivered because of the

493
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,140
industry industrial Network investments

494
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,740
in energy or in other pieces of the

495
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,929
network industrial network at the end I

496
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,990
find four features delivery but for

497
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,539
example imagine that you want something

498
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:30,240
to handle crypto it's a CPU which is not

499
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,039
ready for that now you have to support

500
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,620
it during 15 years or 20 years for

501
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,080
depreciation and then to invest again so

502
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,120
we are lost completely lost so I think

503
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,980
that the issue is is worse than in IP in

504
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,080
IDs is not under control I think boot

505
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
bound is one of the solutions another

506
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,789
solution that I know Katie a lot and

507
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,150
she's trying to promote is to accept

508
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,000
that you will have sooner or later

509
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,390
ability so let's run an ability

510
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,179
coordination program so that's the point

511
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,240
so at the end let's accept the reality

512
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,890
but we need to speed up right so I

513
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,290
learned from Sur Union this morning we

514
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,419
have to speed up undressing you cannot

515
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,470
wait ten years

516
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,390
right to get this ot IT problem solve so

517
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,470
how do you deal with the saturation

518
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,840
today clearly we have to go further on

519
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,179
and for example looking from the

520
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,360
government side that we have to push

521
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,820
forward the standardization process for

522
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,700
not only crypto but also for cyber and

523
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,220
information security in the IOT domain

524
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,090
and actually not only to put forward

525
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,789
standards but to build on top of that

526
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:48,659
some kind of certification or labeling

527
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,990
system especially the last one is now in

528
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,690
progress in in Germany we are pushing

529
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,169
forward a labeling system based

530
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,090
especially on the new EU cybersecurity

531
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,390
framework certification and we are

532
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,330
trying within the next IT security law a

533
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,970
labeling system that could start out

534
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,000
first with IOT components with the

535
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,370
smallest components that are usually

536
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,950
bought by some end-user by some citizen

537
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,830
for example the modern electric light

538
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,890
bulb that is bound into the network and

539
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,220
that could also function as a bot if I

540
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,340
get a bad one so what we need is some

541
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,770
clear labeling what's behind happening

542
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,710
behind the scene is this electric light

543
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,590
bulb really a reliable one now in the

544
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,840
new sense and not that it has a long

545
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,809
living period to show that this - well

546
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,919
it should have some clearly identifiable

547
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,409
security requirements fulfilled know

548
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,780
what we are doing is just putting a sign

549
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,230
on a label on the box there's a QR code

550
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,169
on it and you scan the QR code when

551
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,750
you're trying to we are willing to buy

552
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,840
it and look at some criteria that are

553
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,600
put on a website and just below those

554
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,179
criteria they are great and green flags

555
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,360
so that the BSI can sign okay those

556
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,460
criteria are fulfilled to our knowledge

557
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,270
more they are hurt at the moment so that

558
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,970
that's one step we need that for the IOT

559
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,500
that's in the end of

560
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,160
the customer and citizen we need the

561
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,930
same for the industrial IOT we their

562
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,520
criteria system and a certification

563
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,810
system that shows to anyone using that

564
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,440
IOT that is certified for example under

565
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,990
common criteria and for that we have to

566
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,350
develop our systems on base of the EU

567
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,520
certification framework to make it

568
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,220
mandatory and in the end to come out

569
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,370
with solutions of all the cybersecurity

570
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:01,200
agencies so when you consider that speed

571
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,750
of vulnerabilities or the time of zero

572
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,200
exploits zero time doesn't make sense to

573
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,650
have a certification scheme in place

574
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,970
well I think that there are different

575
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,440
things that you can measure about an

576
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,830
organization's security maturity right

577
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,140
and one of those measures is how do they

578
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,570
handle vulnerabilities that are publicly

579
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,480
publicly reported how are they actually

580
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,460
applying you know the security

581
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,030
mitigations and patches and if we look

582
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,580
at it it's not just about that control

583
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,950
Equifax was brought up earlier today a

584
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,470
lot of people blamed a delay in applying

585
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,650
the available patch as to the reason but

586
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,200
actually if you dig deeper it was that

587
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,470
the sum of their some of their beaconing

588
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,520
systems that were supposed to be

589
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,040
communicating with each other alerting

590
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,110
them then all this data was marching out

591
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,700
the front door those systems were

592
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,560
offline because of expired certificates

593
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,810
so that that goes to show so it's not

594
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,090
like you could just apply a label to

595
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,610
what they did or didn't do in a very you

596
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,820
know siloed way there are multiple

597
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,980
different capability areas that I think

598
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,200
need to be measured and this is going to

599
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,090
be a changing you know a changing thing

600
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,670
for an organization Microsoft started

601
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,890
out at you know in the late 90s as the

602
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,560
laughingstock of security and then you

603
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,320
know incredible Pioneers drove security

604
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,150
forward there and then they became known

605
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,310
as one of the best so it's an it's not a

606
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,010
static measure at all in terms of

607
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,050
capabilities so I think a label might be

608
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,050
difficult to keep up but if you can

609
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,970
choose the right controls to measure and

610
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,860
some assertion and the

611
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,270
certain isn't I have a bug bounty

612
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,679
program therefore I'm good at security

613
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,960
that is absolutely not correct it's not

614
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
to take folks right it is not you know

615
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,900
although a lot of people are using it

616
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,220
that way but if you can if you can

617
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,440
measure across important capability

618
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,350
areas and do that in in enough of an

619
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,000
ongoing basis that you get a general

620
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,309
sense of where people are maturity wise

621
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:58,200
I think that might be helpful so what

622
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,120
what I found interesting marina when we

623
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,590
talk about the norms actually you

624
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,920
develop right first time we have a

625
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,350
techie next to me on a political

626
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,630
discussion how does it work actually in

627
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,760
your norms how the vulnerability and all

628
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,429
this tech stuff will it being considered

629
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:17,370
in your norms well first I want to say

630
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,100
that I've been in several events next to

631
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,340
Katie

632
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,080
very much what we're doing and if you

633
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,510
see I'm bearing my side I'm wearing my

634
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:37,830
cyber bugs another is a student bug they

635
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,350
look the same so that's the importance

636
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,549
of international cooperation and my

637
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,530
final word on bug bounty program is that

638
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,080
it very I think that for governments it

639
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,320
also has to do it's a PR - it's a PR

640
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,120
tool because I think one of the best

641
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,640
things what pentacle did was hack the

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,559
Pentagon I don't know whether they

643
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,360
needed to do it publicly or not but it

644
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,809
worked

645
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,660
so I'm dreaming that at some point we've

646
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,000
discussed it earlier we can do a couple

647
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,190
of things in Estonia for example hack

648
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,650
Estonian online voting so so I think

649
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,390
that governments should do should do

650
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,970
more for the real sense of it but also

651
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,760
for the PR side and I'm a former foreign

652
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,740
minister which means I can say whatever

653
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,790
I want I'm not responsible yes sir so

654
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,950
just just a quick follow-on hack the

655
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,100
Pentagon was was because Microsoft had

656
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,990
finally moved into the bug bounty space

657
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,660
it was Michael Sol Meyer who was who is

658
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,520
at the Pentagon at the time is now of

659
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,169
course at Harvard Belfer Center of

660
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:35,640
course where you know where a lot of

661
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,070
people go but he invited me to brief the

662
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,350
Pentagon on how we actually constructed

663
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,299
it such that we didn't have to bounty

664
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,520
everything such that we were strategic

665
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,230
about it and I actually advised the

666
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,120
Pentagon not to start with a bug bounty

667
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,790
program I told them to please start with

668
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,330
building

669
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,340
a vulnerable coordination program which

670
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,260
will still take you some time if you

671
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,000
think about it it's a relay race right

672
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,330
you who receive the bug that's the baton

673
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,490
try not to drop the baton especially you

674
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,900
know if you're a company like Apple and

675
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,730
managed to drop the baton on that face

676
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,130
but a FaceTime bug they dropped the

677
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,660
baton at the beginning of that week so

678
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,360
ways to kind of create those processes

679
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,270
was my recommendation because they had a

680
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,420
new defense digital service whose job

681
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,550
and charter it was to bring the best of

682
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,510
private private sector technology and

683
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,610
and processes into the Pentagon faster

684
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,980
they wanted to accelerate and that's why

685
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,960
they chose to do a bug bounty they did

686
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,490
also say they would never call it hack

687
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,390
the Pentagon oh well so perhaps to add

688
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,500
to this actually I would never see that

689
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,920
we from the German government would put

690
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,200
on bug bounty program clearly we have a

691
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,960
different role that might be a good

692
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,120
thing for a company that produces

693
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,820
software and tries to get some

694
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,060
information by different ways we have to

695
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,550
be a broker in the game and it's never

696
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,400
good ever broker starts paying on one

697
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,920
side then it starts getting paid on the

698
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,880
other one that is something we don't we

699
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,350
don't can't do so what we need is some

700
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,170
process to deal with weaknesses clearly

701
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,180
we have a process that's just called

702
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,760
beside federal office for information

703
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,390
security

704
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,520
so there's clear reporting system if

705
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,910
someone might be anyone reports to the

706
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,850
B's ID and it's for sure that the BSI

707
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,400
goes up to the one who produced the

708
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,730
system or the software and reports this

709
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,520
again and tries to push forward fixing

710
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,150
this weakness clearly besides that we

711
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,280
need as a government that has ought to

712
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,980
also to support the work of the police

713
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,040
forces and the intelligence services we

714
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,290
have to have a reliable process in

715
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,730
managing weaknesses that are used for

716
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,940
for some way for the police to go into

717
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,760
networks on legal basis and that legal

718
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,020
basis exists

719
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,670
in Germany and there they need some

720
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,410
weaknesses and so clearly there has to

721
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,480
be a process and that is set up at the

722
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,570
moment I already started some half-open

723
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,110
discussion process different Noah fund

724
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,530
and so we are going forward now to

725
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,850
establish a process that is also

726
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,429
acceptable for the public that is

727
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,950
acceptable for the experts and Indian

728
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,200
that's acceptable for the German

729
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,090
parliament and the government so that we

730
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,070
can all do our job on a reliable basis

731
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,470
but in terms of speed I would say

732
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,929
handling those new processes from the

733
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,870
government point of view unit struggle

734
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:54,500
with agility I'm sure when I would ask

735
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,050
the ones here from producing companies

736
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,420
that come up to us with certification

737
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,880
requirements they would always say

738
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,550
there's not enough agility and dynamic

739
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,020
into the process the government

740
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,390
establishes we are working on that and

741
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,700
there are some proofs actually I feel

742
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,580
that we can do so for example in the

743
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,130
field of secure elements I think we do a

744
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:21,900
good job there and we have found a way

745
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,390
to deal with industry in a production

746
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,220
cycle so that they can get their

747
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,320
certification right when they put the

748
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,260
product in the market so that's

749
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,300
important for the company but that's

750
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,740
also important for the government

751
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,500
because it makes no sense to put all the

752
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,630
certification on the product that was

753
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,030
given to us two years ago and that's

754
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,920
already vanished from the market it

755
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,960
makes no sense so we have to find new

756
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,300
processes and that's also part of the

757
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,120
certification framework we ask them how

758
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,580
do these certification vulnerability

759
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,100
topic still takes part of your norms

760
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,410
you're developing is that a part of your

761
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,840
strategy and having an idea globally

762
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,670
because that's not obviously only a

763
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,650
German problem or in the u.s. problem

764
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,740
itself is the global problem it big but

765
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,390
it brings back to the question of

766
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,000
clarity just to understand and to know

767
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,490
everybody understands what allowed what

768
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,910
not do we listen to 80 80 people do

769
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,920
listen to techniques a lot of speaking

770
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,500
about our commission so our first norm

771
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,060
if you just google cyber stability

772
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,720
dot-org

773
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,090
our first norm was protection of the

774
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,860
public core of Internet

775
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,010
I can't imagine we could have done that

776
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,640
without very deep expertise coming from

777
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,820
that sector from the IT people sector on

778
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,130
certification well I have to say that

779
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,510
our Commission has not paid much

780
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,450
attention on dealing much with that but

781
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,790
I do think that certifications are

782
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,310
needed so that what we heard also today

783
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,340
from Julian King so I absolutely agree

784
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,380
here with him so on the research side

785
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,200
what is pain thinking about this topic

786
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,680
actually certification and getting

787
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,150
vulnerabilities maybe now in a standard

788
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,600
process addressed I think there are lot

789
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,929
of good ideas coming from research we

790
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,090
have to listen to probably to come back

791
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,070
to foundations like I was talking at the

792
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,659
beginning to reshape and reset trying to

793
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,949
talk each other trying to find common

794
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,230
goals but here for sure there is another

795
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,770
point there are a lot of interest from

796
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,800
the research community to help

797
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,550
they have been approached several times

798
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,739
by industry saying ok who is the one who

799
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,949
knows more about this ok will hire him

800
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,370
but they will not give you back anything

801
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,750
so I think this is a win-win - should be

802
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,330
a win-win approach so once we have

803
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,210
win-win approach we we should shift the

804
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,580
paradigm so I think that because of the

805
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,130
norm so difficult and so on that's good

806
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,980
sounds very good but we have to think

807
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,740
about the reality which is dynamics so

808
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,170
there is a lot of dynamics now we have

809
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,230
to think about the end users because we

810
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,880
all share the common goal of having

811
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,410
resilience I think this is something

812
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,300
that we are heats it down because we all

813
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,290
want this so what about end users what

814
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:24,360
about the experts we should trying to

815
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,860
give from from

816
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,470
a broad picture and holistic approach in

817
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,100
which we have to listen and then to talk

818
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,030
and not like we are doing things we're

819
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,550
trying to talk saying this is the thing

820
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,950
that we have to do and then we will

821
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,780
listen I think the research community

822
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,960
have a lot of experience here even

823
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,030
startups that have fight against

824
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,820
certifications which are very cost

825
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,160
effective and then you know the number

826
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,100
of versions that any of us is updating

827
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,950
each month devices so we should think

828
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,350
about it animate the dynamics of the

829
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,050
updates and so on and be ready that we

830
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,160
will need to pass and try to foster

831
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,460
processes to become you know more ií'll

832
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,810
on on this kind of processes but think

833
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,890
about for cost-effective solutions

834
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,970
because the objective is to have more

835
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,090
resilient society so presuming that we

836
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,960
have done the job well on having a

837
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,280
global governance in place having maybe

838
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,170
also the rules and norms everything has

839
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,360
been established Maria still you

840
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,280
listening to all your customers who are

841
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,430
problems have problems with fraud so

842
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,380
what actually are the problems on the

843
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,320
customer side from the organizational

844
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,020
point of view in order to be fit for the

845
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,940
future culture wise maybe I think it's

846
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,740
not just fraud right it's actually the

847
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,070
threat and I think we can't mistake

848
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,930
compliance frameworks resiliency

849
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,930
processes for security we everyone's

850
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,570
checking a box on security and that

851
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,400
doesn't make you more secure so if you

852
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,410
look at PCI compliance if you look at

853
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,630
the NIST framework and who's updating it

854
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,240
we talked a lot today about AI we talked

855
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,520
a lot today about technology the

856
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,410
evolution the evolution of the criminal

857
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,960
the evolution of the actor you know and

858
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,640
all the tools they're using but no one's

859
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,680
looking at you know are we updating any

860
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,450
of the things that we say are going to

861
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,310
make us more secure I don't think you

862
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,170
can use security the word security and

863
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,020
compliance or you know a framework or

864
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,109
result all in the same like in this

865
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:42,339
I just don't think it means you're

866
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,829
secure I think what a customers expect I

867
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,589
think into customers get their money

868
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,859
back

869
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:50,920
mm-hmm right when they're defrauded when

870
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,200
they something happens the banks are

871
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,230
giving their money back until they have

872
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,319
to be accountable as well I think they

873
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,309
won't they're not going to pay attention

874
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:02,769
to security we have to change people's

875
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,410
behavior we do have to educate them but

876
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,569
we've been talking for what 15 20 years

877
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:10,510
about educating people they use strong

878
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,140
passwords you know don't click on links

879
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,910
you know maybe I mean what you name it

880
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,109
we've all heard about it but people

881
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:18,940
still aren't doing it so what's going to

882
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,799
change people's behavior mm-hmm and

883
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,099
every I think every company has you know

884
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,619
programs in place to educate if you go

885
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:28,569
to any financial website there's

886
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,160
programs out there to educate their

887
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,529
customers and their consumers the banks

888
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:34,750
are starting to take a different role or

889
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,779
a different you know stance if you have

890
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,670
given away your credentials and you've

891
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,980
transferred that money they may not give

892
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,720
that money back to you I think when that

893
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,849
starts happening people are gonna pay

894
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:48,730
more attention and I think there has to

895
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,650
be you know there has to be implications

896
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,130
there has to be reasons why you change

897
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,299
you know the the reason I believe I was

898
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:01,119
surprised by the way that so so few

899
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,920
hands were coming up when we talk about

900
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,500
the weather we are over regulated on

901
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,630
cyber or not I believe actually we have

902
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,210
a lot of rules and norms whether on

903
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,359
compliance in place and the working with

904
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,220
corporations I feel that they already

905
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,329
have a compliant tsunami in place my

906
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:23,140
question would be how does the Board of

907
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,299
Directors could really measure their

908
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,039
risk nowadays when we thought we heard

909
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,380
about that they're connected risk yeah

910
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,410
so that's not two-dimensional risk

911
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,170
equation anymore my question would be to

912
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,809
you guys do we not think about new

913
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,789
frameworks on how to evaluate risk

914
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:44,410
enterprise risk and what are some steps

915
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,160
forward well I think there's there's

916
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,289
definitely that description is correct

917
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:51,800
there's a tsunami

918
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,200
of regulations there's a tsunami of

919
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,080
different standards and requirements and

920
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,820
there hasn't been enough harmonization

921
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,950
of where the overlaps with you where can

922
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,900
you provide efficiencies if you do PCI

923
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,690
and you do HIPAA where you know where do

924
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,970
you not have to repeat your efforts and

925
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,670
all of that stuff but all of that still

926
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,310
leads us to this place where we we

927
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,930
haven't figured out what are the

928
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,600
essential controls to do well in order

929
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,370
to protect against most things no one

930
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,870
has actually agreed upon that you know

931
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,020
there's just lists of lists and I think

932
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,490
in order to even get through all of

933
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,040
those you would probably die in place in

934
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,140
an organization it's never going to be

935
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,440
enough for a particular CSO or seaso to

936
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,840
affect you know huge amounts of change

937
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,760
that push the needle that much in any

938
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,620
given organization similar with

939
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,630
governments they are in conflict they

940
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,260
are in conflict with do more with less

941
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,230
spend very little in terms of your you

942
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,840
know in terms of your budgets keep the

943
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,910
equipment working as long as possible

944
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,490
well that puts them out of update update

945
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,290
ability to the latest versions in a lot

946
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,720
of ways so we are dealing with conflict

947
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,000
that among these different regulations

948
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,970
and policies and a lack of harmonization

949
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,710
so the key learning for me actually we

950
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,900
talked about collaboration a lot today I

951
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,880
think for the next couple of years it's

952
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,160
more important to orchestrate and maybe

953
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,650
optimize all the efforts we're gonna

954
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,560
have to run with we have only five

955
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,500
minutes left I I see and and the beauty

956
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,710
is that you will have the last words in

957
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,170
front of mr. Rottier and I thought that

958
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,770
you maybe think about one single goal or

959
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,200
priority do you have on your wrist or on

960
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,750
your table get it realized tomorrow

961
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,570
whatever it cost just feel it could be

962
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,550
done what would it be and how it would

963
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,710
be to what level it would be increase

964
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,710
our stability in cyber and Maria I would

965
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,430
love to do choice first okay so I think

966
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,470
number one I think the there's no

967
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,940
regulation with the criminals right

968
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,160
mm-hmm so and we go to these conferences

969
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,750
how many conferences have you been to

970
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,890
that people talked about this

971
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,620
information sharing how do we work

972
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,290
together for a common goal let's break

973
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,910
down barriers

974
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,130
you know let's start here let's start

975
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,220
here today what's one thing take leaving

976
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,769
this conference today that we all agree

977
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:13,910
that we're going to go and do we're

978
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,410
going to do different is there one thing

979
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,809
with all these you have some people that

980
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,579
have the authority and the power to make

981
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,710
a change what's the one thing that we

982
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,690
could say based on this conference we're

983
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,569
gonna do and I don't have that answer

984
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,519
but I think there's a lot of really

985
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,470
smart people in this room smarter than

986
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,720
me that we could come up with one thing

987
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,730
and we won't execute it on today but

988
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,980
let's go execute let's figure it out and

989
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,900
let's go execute it make make it

990
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,700
different make this conference different

991
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,200
and the next year when we come back

992
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,839
let's see did we execute on the one

993
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,190
thing that we thought we would do

994
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:51,069
together collectively thank you Andres

995
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,529
when I look at different topics that are

996
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:56,390
viral and at the moment for example the

997
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:01,160
5g topic then it becomes clear that two

998
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,829
topics are closely interrelated there's

999
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:05,900
digital sovereignty on one side and

1000
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,480
supply chain security on the other side

1001
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,200
and so my wish would be that all real

1002
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,440
good abstract standards and norms we

1003
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,930
have developed during the last years and

1004
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,809
they are there already that we put this

1005
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:25,099
forward into real regulation that is

1006
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,009
oriented at the functionality we want to

1007
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:30,349
reach what gives you immediately the

1008
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,049
security that anyone needs within the

1009
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:35,240
network so that if that could be done

1010
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,380
tomorrow okay thank you bro I would take

1011
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,809
the opportunity that the audience has a

1012
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:45,829
lot of experience and brought us a lot

1013
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,869
of prosperity till today because

1014
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:52,250
managing top-level organizations but we

1015
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,279
have to teach to make education to

1016
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:57,319
educate and to teach or children that

1017
00:43:57,319 --> 00:43:59,299
will be the leaders of tomorrow so I

1018
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:01,279
think that we have to bring back ethics

1019
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:03,650
we have to bring back and try to have

1020
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,119
and get these common goals

1021
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,960
so I will I borrowed a sentence from

1022
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,829
Mother Teresa

1023
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:12,079
which is give the world the best you

1024
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,599
have and you make it hard give the world

1025
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,460
your best anyway so I think this is the

1026
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,900
you know my thank you always very

1027
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,550
difficult to say something after mother

1028
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:28,290
Teresa but I have two things if I have

1029
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,690
to pick one then I'd like to say that

1030
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,170
let's move in multi-stakeholder model

1031
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,390
inclusiveness from slogans to deeds and

1032
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,020
I'm also looking at industry and private

1033
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,119
sector people who are here it means also

1034
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,720
better cooperation among yourself not

1035
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,240
only the Giants but listening to SMEs

1036
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,339
because when we go to places to

1037
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,440
conferences like this one we see the

1038
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,589
same big ones big guys how much is the

1039
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:59,630
well voice of SMEs heard I don't know so

1040
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,980
multi-stakeholder model from slogan to

1041
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,359
deeds and second I hope that

1042
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,589
cybersecurity next year we'll move to

1043
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,240
the main stage of the Munich Security

1044
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,540
Conference

1045
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:26,250
okay another hard act to follow so I it

1046
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,520
is Valentine's Day and no one is

1047
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,940
mentioned Valentine's Day in the context

1048
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,359
of our topic so I'm gonna try here we go

1049
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,190
you know I think that I have been a

1050
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,450
professional in the security industry

1051
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,780
for 20 years I started when I was just

1052
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,410
guess okay but I was I was not trained

1053
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,849
in computer science that was not my

1054
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,800
major I was a molecular biologist and a

1055
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,089
mathematician I worked on the human

1056
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:53,190
genome project and at that time I

1057
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,440
thought World Peace will happen once

1058
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,869
once we mapped the genome because we're

1059
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:01,530
all so similar right that apparently did

1060
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,369
not work out so here we are in this age

1061
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:07,020
where we've been trying a lot of the

1062
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,060
same things over and over again and I

1063
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,190
look at it you know not as a security

1064
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,530
lifecycle but here we go a security love

1065
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,710
cycle where we have actually been caught

1066
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,200
in the immature phase of being

1067
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,780
infatuated with security and trendy

1068
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,550
topics and things like bug bounties but

1069
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,330
a bug bounty in in that sense or even

1070
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,700
vulnerability discovery at all is just

1071
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,450
this

1072
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,390
one aspect of the problem that we have

1073
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,270
to solve and so much like in love you

1074
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,150
have to progress to a more mature

1075
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,490
committed stage and eventually to

1076
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,670
cohabitate forever with security and so

1077
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,099
I think that what we need to do if we

1078
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:48,480
could if we could change the world

1079
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,130
tonight and tomorrow would be a

1080
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,990
different place we would nail the basics

1081
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,180
at scale which we never managed to do

1082
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,190
when the internet was smaller when I

1083
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,570
first started hacking things the

1084
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,070
internet was a lot smaller than it is

1085
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,099
today and we did not I retired from

1086
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,780
professional hacking a dozen years ago

1087
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,300
and yet systems are still vulnerable to

1088
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,089
me and that is our problem because we

1089
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:11,880
got caught in the infatuation stage of

1090
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,880
our love affair with security so let's

1091
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,450
mature this love together and you know

1092
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,240
not just be committed but cohabitate

1093
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,579
with it in all of the boring ways that

1094
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,790
security hygiene is necessary right

1095
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,200
people say that we need to make security

1096
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,180
sexy well hacking things is sexy but

1097
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,980
eventually somebody's got to fix them

1098
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,660
and somebody's got to prevent them and

1099
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,670
that's basically the dental hygiene

1100
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,980
day-to-day love affair with security

1101
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,450
that we should be having that's

1102
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,080
committed thank you so much

1103
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,790
[Applause]

1104
