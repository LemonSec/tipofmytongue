[Music]

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,800
so and welcome to the first panel ladies

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,950
and gentlemen and welcome to Munich I

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,960
only came here once before this I came

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,150
to the third one and based on my

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,070
experience so far it's always a hot

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,740
sunny day on the day of the Munich

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,170
cybersecurity conference so the sun's

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,939
beating down I have every sympathy for

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,010
the the guys in the sunshine over there

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,260
two years ago when I was here I was here

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,210
in my capacity as the director-general

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,160
of digital Europe choose the tech

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,860
industry association and I'd also had

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,530
the privilege of leading a European

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,140
Commission policy forum on the digital

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,840
transformation of Europe's industry and

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,760
enterprises a fantastic forum brought

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,430
together many brilliant people and of

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,890
course cybersecurity was very much on

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,050
the agenda then as it remains on the

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,410
agenda today so now I spend time and

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,090
that delightful phase of my career where

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,309
I can do a series of things and one of

25
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,619
the things I'm doing is as a global tech

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,490
advisor to a communications company

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,740
Burson conan wolf which is a merger of

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,650
two of the many WPP communications

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,930
company a burson-marsteller and conan

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,540
wolf and one of our clients is telstra

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,640
the australian telecommunications

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,960
company and this is relevant to our

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,549
panel this afternoon and they're just

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,400
about to produce a report it'll come out

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,799
at the end of this month looking at

36
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,200
digital transformation on a global basis

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,320
and they've surveyed I think over 3,800

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,650
individuals in a dozen or so markets and

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,070
14 I think geographies and two things

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,799
emerged from that one that is very

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,170
relevant for today is that the

42
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,180
protection of digital assets is very

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,340
high on the agenda of everyone

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,020
undergoing a digital transformation

45
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,299
you'd sort of think that would be the

46
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,469
case wouldn't you but it's reassuring

47
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,509
that that comes out in the server but

48
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,399
the other thing that's relevant to our

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,530
panel and our discussion this afternoon

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,500
is that this survey looked at digital

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,970
transformation through four different

52
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,940
lenses if you will it looks deep through

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,800
the lens of process it

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
to date through the lens of technology

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,010
how well do people understand the

56
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,720
technology it looks at it very

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,670
importantly through the lens of process

58
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,670
and finally through the lens of people

59
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,800
and in a way I think that's the way the

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,270
panel's have been organized you're in

61
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,590
this conference this afternoon and we

62
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,810
have the privilege of organizing and

63
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,600
talking about that first topic that well

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,030
the last in my list of people so I can

65
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,490
sit down not turn my back now to my

66
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,620
panelists now I I am joined by five

67
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,730
great panelists who were all going to

68
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,910
make a really good contribution to this

69
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,590
and we're going to we're going to begin

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,130
it will try anyway to focus on people in

71
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,340
three groups and staff users or

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,200
customers as the second group and bad

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,000
actors as the third group now there's

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,490
clearly some overlap between those three

75
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,790
different groups but and and in fact

76
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,030
it's it was brought home to me recently

77
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,410
with some some other work we'd been

78
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,240
doing with Santander actually we've been

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,530
looking at the perpetration of data

80
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,840
breaches in the banking sector globally

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,980
in 2017

82
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,290
and this was a piece of work that I

83
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,140
think IBM had done and and I was quite

84
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,840
surprised to find that of those data

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,600
breaches only 42 percent were due to

86
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,190
outsiders only five percent were due to

87
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,959
malicious or bad actors and over half

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,770
were inadvertent insiders so it's very

89
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,630
relevant that we're talking over half I

90
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
mean that's that's staggering so it's

91
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,959
very relevant that we're talking about

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,330
staff as the first of those people now

93
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,950
let me introduce the panelists to you

94
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,030
and in Oprah so starting on my rights

95
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,660
Larry Clinton now Larry if you read if

96
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,750
you read his intro it says he literally

97
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,300
wrote the book on cyber risk management

98
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,440
I think you've got some copies of the

99
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,690
book with you haven't Hillary the cyber

100
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,430
risk management handbook published by

101
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,050
the National Association of corporate

102
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,420
directors and endorsed by the US

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,190
government and last year in conjunction

104
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,070
with BSI here in Germany you produce the

105
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,169
German edition of the handbook as well

106
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,490
so it's great to have you on the panel

107
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,690
to motor hero to Chia Oprah

108
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,230
that correctly is a professor at the Keo

109
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,630
University graduate school of media and

110
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,060
governance in Japan but he's also been

111
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,370
the deputy director of the university's

112
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,640
Global Research Institute since 2016

113
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,830
you've done more than written the book I

114
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,660
think you've written about 30 books

115
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,060
this guy's written our intelligence and

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,730
national security cyber terror cyber

117
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,180
security and international relations so

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,890
we won't carry on through the sort of

119
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,330
competing on number of books

120
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,460
Kirstin at this point Kirsten's already

121
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,740
had a brief introduction she's the

122
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,080
managing director of the cyber readiness

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,450
Institute and it brings together senior

124
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,760
leaders of global companies so big

125
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,620
companies coming together to help small

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,090
companies small and medium-sized

127
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,040
companies improve their cybersecurity

128
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,100
and your creds Kirsten very impressive

129
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,140
was formerly the executive director of

130
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,030
the u.s. Presidential Commission on

131
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,730
enhancing national cybersecurity so a

132
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,950
lot of a lot of experience to bring to

133
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,550
our panel on my immediate left Stefan

134
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,520
Mik 'lets is the engineering director at

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,820
Google here in Munich responsible for

136
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,060
privacy and identity and you manage

137
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,430
engineering teams who provide I mean a

138
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,990
lot of Engineers in your teams I think

139
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,060
provide users and staff with the tools

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,370
to control and manage their privacy and

141
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,450
I know you're also helped with the

142
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,040
development of the Google products as

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,710
well but last but by no means least

144
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,900
who's going actually going to kick us

145
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,290
off in this discussion is Stefan ludus

146
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,330
now Stefan I think you've got a

147
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,070
brilliant job Stefan it's very

148
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,990
impressive he's the computer security

149
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,240
officer at CERN which as you know is the

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,460
European Organization for particle

151
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,770
physics based in Switzerland two and a

152
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,510
half thousand staff so that's a pretty

153
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,730
good start you know for our discussion

154
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,780
but interestingly also when I counted 17

155
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,790
and a half thousand scientists around

156
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,310
the world maybe more now involved in

157
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,020
CERN's research were clearly all going

158
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,910
to have a their fingers in your system

159
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,190
somehow and we want to start with Stefan

160
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,330
on this issue of staff because Stefan

161
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,700
when we were having a pre discussion you

162
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,590
were actually quite vocal about the

163
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,320
quality of the people that we're joining

164
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,400
you and there a bill

165
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,600
to cope with the the demands on them to

166
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,540
help us protect our digital assets a get

167
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,630
the ball rolling Stefan if you would

168
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,660
yeah I didn't want to offend anybody but

169
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,400
just from coming back to cybersecurity

170
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
risk it's proportionate to the threat

171
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,810
the probability of having

172
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,430
vulnerabilities and to probability of

173
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,320
consequences I don't control the threat

174
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,169
part so I don't train attackers but I'm

175
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,750
doing the the defense so I have to be at

176
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,639
the contrary consequences we're running

177
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,020
lots and lots of different digital

178
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,960
systems like ours is doing and the

179
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,340
problem I'm facing we engaging with

180
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,750
students we're having lots lots of

181
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,919
people coming from all over the world

182
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,710
working at CERN for master thesis or for

183
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,780
bachelor thesis for short moment doing

184
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,870
development on control systems or on

185
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,169
soft developments and what I see is that

186
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,760
those students basically not coming with

187
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,990
a cybersecurity mindset to get web

188
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,060
designers they know brilliantly up to

189
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,690
set a web page web server but they don't

190
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,639
know how to do securely database

191
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,889
administrators don't know how to do it

192
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,570
securely so I was looking why is that

193
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,000
and in many many curriculums of

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,610
universities maybe not of some of the

195
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,900
professor's which are here but many

196
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,660
universities don't teach this for your

197
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,080
bachelor you doing operating systems

198
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,660
programming databases web secure web

199
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,639
service if you ask about security know

200
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,500
this comes later for the master and I

201
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,120
think this is this is utterly wrong

202
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,220
having a security conference is utterly

203
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,260
wrong actually because I've never seen

204
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,720
their functionality conference or

205
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,470
maintainability conference on

206
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,599
availability conference functionality

207
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,979
conference there's not existing why is

208
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,990
security different for me and this is

209
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,860
why all the two starters those students

210
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,110
should get an education when they learn

211
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,390
to program to program securely if they

212
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,400
learn setting a web server to set a web

213
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,559
server securely setting up databases

214
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,469
securely virtualization in a secure

215
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,159
fashion and what I see is the students I

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,339
am hiring the students earners hiring

217
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,300
usually they don't come with such a

218
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,070
background and we're not talking about

219
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,360
cyber security since yesterday talking

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
about this since at least I do since

221
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,010
2003 and

222
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,330
wonder why is that is that because you

223
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,400
are at Google employing all the best

224
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,780
people who've got the cybersecurity

225
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,060
skills and there's nothing left for

226
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,890
anyone else no well how do you file do

227
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,500
you find it value vish right

228
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,860
so it's certainly true baby have we have

229
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,390
a number of security experts on the

230
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,000
staff and we have a huge team that cares

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,820
about security not only for our users

232
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,560
which is mostly what my team is doing

233
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,600
but also internally and but then again

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,950
right we have a lot of staff and we have

235
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,450
a lot of people from different

236
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,120
backgrounds what I think is universally

237
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,710
true is that people understand the

238
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,220
importance of security especially on the

239
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,340
staff but that doesn't actually save you

240
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,770
at all right because everybody can get

241
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,160
fished and there's and that includes all

242
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,780
of the experts here in this room and

243
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,700
phishing attacks are increasingly

244
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,310
getting sophisticated to a level where I

245
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,590
think nobody here would be able to

246
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,280
distinguish so we have to be aware that

247
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,230
but everybody on the staff and everybody

248
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,770
handling our systems and there's many it

249
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,600
could be or every account could be under

250
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,610
attack of control and so we have to

251
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,620
defend against that as well which is a

252
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,600
very big part of our do you find the

253
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,390
same thing as Stephan that the people

254
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,550
joining you are basically immature in

255
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,970
their skills I know I wouldn't say that

256
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,580
you wouldn't think it would disagree on

257
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,860
that in a sense that and they might not

258
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,010
know all the things that they need to do

259
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,690
but they're certainly aware of it and

260
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,280
and they if given the resources they are

261
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,290
availablein to find out and let me tend

262
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,010
to Larry Nest if I may what so you've

263
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,990
been running this program for a number

264
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,190
of years you'd be you've written a

265
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,810
handbook why have you not fixed this

266
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,960
Larry we're doing our best

267
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,600
so I one of the reasons I like to speak

268
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,760
to European audiences sometimes more

269
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,350
than American audiences you folks are

270
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,130
classically trained so I think we should

271
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,710
go back to marcus aurelius who says of

272
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,720
all things you must find the essence of

273
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
it and the essence of the problem

274
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
in cyber security is not vulnerabilities

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,209
technology is just how cyber attacks

276
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,519
occur for us to get to the essence of

277
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,009
this we need to understand why the

278
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,500
attacks occurred and the core problem is

279
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,800
economic the the economic balance in

280
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,079
cybersecurity attacks are cheap to

281
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,630
acquire easy to operate very profitable

282
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,130
you have a great business model and on

283
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,709
the other hand the defenders were

284
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,990
defending a inherently vulnerable system

285
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,630
we're always one step down to the

286
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,680
attacker they have first mover advantage

287
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,569
and we have virtually no law enforcement

288
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,430
yeah but Larry I'm gonna see that's the

289
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,959
lab those are the bad guys here's what

290
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,079
about what about the poor this is the

291
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,600
point is that that we're asking the

292
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,399
wrong questions we need to change the

293
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,600
paradigm the reason we don't have enough

294
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
and you probably all go to Google but

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,310
the reason we don't have enough

296
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,060
sophisticated people in this space is

297
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,470
because nobody teaches security in in

298
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,190
the universities but why it's because

299
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,730
nobody wants to pay for security so I'm

300
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,589
guessing virtually everybody in this

301
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,889
room has a smartphone be honest now how

302
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,569
many of you asked about the security

303
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,120
when you bought this your smart phone

304
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,920
always for liars

305
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,209
they're always through the floor liners

306
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,240
in every breath we don't want it by the

307
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,410
way the government does won't pay for

308
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,899
security either one of my companies had

309
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,560
laptops and for a defense system put in

310
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,139
and they came to him and said hey these

311
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,269
are insecure and the company said no

312
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,470
problem we can secure them cost you know

313
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,569
the two dollars a laptop government said

314
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:47,139
no thank you

315
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,519
so laptops going in the core the reason

316
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,649
we need to change the paradigm is that

317
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,970
we are not talking about the economics

318
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,970
they don't teach secure coding because

319
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,160
nobody wants to buy secure coders they

320
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,259
want what we want we want apps we want

321
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,680
we want cheap we want fast what do we

322
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,319
want what we want you know fix my

323
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,089
internet get my internet to be faster

324
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,689
until we reformulate the economics of

325
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:17,199
this issue we are going to be nibbling

326
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,149
around the edges if you want I've got a

327
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,520
whole book on the cyber social

328
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,200
contract we need to fundamentally

329
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,630
rethink the relationship between

330
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,150
industry and government with respect to

331
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,760
our economics just the way Hegel and

332
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,920
Locke and Hume rethought the

333
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,830
relationship between the citizen and

334
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,960
government a couple hundred years ago

335
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,210
and by the way just the way you guys

336
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,680
managed your situation after World War

337
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,040
two for hundreds of years Western Europe

338
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,620
has been ravaged by almost constant

339
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,440
warfare two horrible world wars in the

340
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,980
last century for the last 75 years

341
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,190
virtually total peace and prosperity did

342
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,530
you solve that problem by resolving all

343
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,400
of the vulnerabilities at the borders or

344
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,690
did you get to the essence of it and

345
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,340
realize you needed to work together

346
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,160
you're right essence all Europeans you

347
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,890
needed to erect new bottles with new

348
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,290
ways of interacting and entities that

349
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,540
thought of themselves as competitors for

350
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,370
years needed to start to work together

351
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,580
when you did that you got 75 years of

352
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,070
world peace government and industry need

353
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,570
to do that now all these wonderful

354
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,970
partnership programs I'm involved with a

355
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,130
lot of we're nibbling around the edges

356
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,260
and they're not real partnerships not

357
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,380
the way Google does a partnership with a

358
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,880
company you're going to partnership

359
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,750
where you sit down and you talk about

360
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,920
the economics and make sure it's

361
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,360
profitable for both that doesn't happen

362
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,190
with industry government talks that's

363
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,350
the reason kiss and you've worked on

364
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,650
both sides of this partnership potential

365
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,650
partnership government and industry dues

366
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,610
do you agree with Larry say no makes it

367
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,550
more interesting but I want to step back

368
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,560
from what Larry saying a little bit and

369
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,510
that's what happens a lot we go back and

370
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,610
forth on this so one of the things that

371
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,720
you're talking about when you talk about

372
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,150
the human you reference the Commission

373
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,410
that I worked on and one of the key

374
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,910
issues that we discussed in that

375
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,490
commission was moving security away from

376
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,100
the end user or educating the end user

377
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,380
and what you'll hopefully all think to

378
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,490
yourself is well those are not

379
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,200
necessarily in conflict they can be

380
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,210
reconciled but there is this feeling

381
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,070
when you talk to technology people it's

382
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,540
you know just get the humans out of the

383
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,900
loop

384
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,240
well that is ideal but we don't live in

385
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,900
the avatar

386
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,970
humans are gonna be in this world and

387
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,460
humans do interact so we've got to think

388
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,200
about what do we need to do to educate

389
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
the end user and I would look at that in

390
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,130
in two environments and one of which

391
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,630
will align with what Larry's saying and

392
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,830
I'll just disagree with them at some

393
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,210
point just to make it feel better for

394
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,760
you John go through this but the first

395
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,800
is is we look at organizations we have

396
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,260
to educate our workforce we have to

397
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,000
educate the workforce on the basic

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,670
elements phishing authentication those

399
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,470
elements where humans have direct

400
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,779
interaction and I really push back on

401
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,820
the term cyber workforce certainly we

402
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,589
have specialties that require

403
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,960
engineering math and science but really

404
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,610
each of us are part of the cyber

405
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,830
workforce and if we don't push that

406
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,080
responsibility and that accountability

407
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,690
to every individual we're truly missing

408
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,779
out on the opportunity to educate the

409
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,850
second piece of this is as you look at

410
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,350
the organization's we're also talking

411
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,930
about society so oftentimes in the

412
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,550
United States but it happens around the

413
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,350
world when you hear a breach what you

414
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,940
then hear the news stories coming out

415
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,950
around are the individuals saying well

416
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,510
what if I was breached what if they got

417
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,980
my information what if what are they

418
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,020
gonna do with it what do I do now and I

419
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,400
would argue that that's actually not the

420
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,080
question or the right time for the

421
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,450
question we as individuals and this is

422
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,980
about educating the culture in the

423
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,990
society we need to be asking those

424
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,000
questions beforehand we need to be

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,430
asking about the security before we

426
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,680
reserve a room at a hotel before we

427
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,170
purchase a car before we fly an airline

428
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,810
because as long as we don't make

429
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,000
security a differentiator to Larry's

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,349
point companies won't make it a

431
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,929
differentiator we as consumers have to

432
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,150
start making it a differentiator we tend

433
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,579
to think of humans as a liability when

434
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,470
we think about security but humans can

435
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,689
also be an asset an educated workforce

436
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:19,689
and educated society is an asset and to

437
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,400
Larry's point about who asked the

438
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,280
question about their iPhones I traded in

439
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,920
my iPhone last summer and the engineer

440
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,809
the the technician as he was switching

441
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,160
it out was going through all the

442
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
security preferences he was just

443
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,559
clicking and clicking and clicking I

444
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,820
said wait a second what are you clicking

445
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,740
he was actually making the preferences

446
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,900
for me and I stepped back and I said you

447
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,730
know here is a great opportunity to

448
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,190
educate an entire society how many of us

449
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,280
have Samsung's have apples purchase them

450
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,140
when you are looking and you go to a

451
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,730
store and they start

452
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,169
looking through for you what an

453
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,910
opportunity because to Larry's point we

454
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,280
all hold a smartphone for an individual

455
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,620
to be able to be educated on this so the

456
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,840
point is we have to be looking at

457
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,910
security as a differentiator not just in

458
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,160
our society but in organizations and as

459
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,080
leaders and we talked about the board's

460
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,600
earlier top-down bottom-up we need to be

461
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,490
requiring that accountability and that

462
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,740
responsibility from all employees and

463
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,330
from all citizens and most a hero

464
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,340
weekend we're often I think criticized

465
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,100
correctly in European conferences for

466
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,710
having a bit of a European us loving and

467
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,049
we don't often get the Asian perspective

468
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,000
so it's great that you'll hear this

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,120
afternoon that should a week should we

470
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,559
learn anything else from Asian

471
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,000
perspectives we often feel that you're

472
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,040
sort of more add back on imagine that

473
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,140
story of going into the Apple Store and

474
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,940
they the operator clicking through the

475
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,530
options for you would that happen would

476
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,320
that happen in Japan okay so much so

477
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,120
thank you for inviting me so I'm

478
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,669
teaching cybersecurity policy or

479
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,730
strategy in my university so I'm helping

480
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,710
the Japanese government to formulate a

481
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,780
cybersecurity policy and the government

482
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,690
people are very very frustrated with me

483
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,570
and university professors because you

484
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,490
are not teaching good students to

485
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,770
Japanese universities so I always say

486
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,210
it's too late too late to educate 20

487
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,880
years old students so I want to talk

488
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,520
about the North Korean experience

489
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,030
because maybe so Russia or Iran might be

490
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,730
your enemy possible enemies but so China

491
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,059
North Korea our possible enemies in

492
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,270
cyberspace actually so in North Korea so

493
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,390
the government is picking up elementary

494
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,390
school student pupils maybe less than 10

495
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,040
years old and if they find a good

496
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,410
student in mathematics so they will pick

497
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,600
it up pick him up pick him up and so

498
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,130
those students are transferring to

499
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,590
Pyongyang and so their families are

500
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,780
living in a very gorgeous apartment and

501
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,210
so they are educated in a very talented

502
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,790
two universities universities later

503
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,040
so North Korea has three universities

504
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,430
for computer science

505
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,250
and we counted a possible graduates

506
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,050
number so it could be 7000 now but 7000

507
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,830
IT employees cannot be hired in North

508
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,770
Korea so what happens so if you prove

509
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,840
that you are very loyal to the North

510
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,380
Korean leadership they will be sent to

511
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,200
foreign countries China Malaysia and

512
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,720
friendly countries so they run now IT

513
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
business and sometimes they get to order

514
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,480
from puron so they start hacking so

515
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
those kind of system is working in North

516
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,140
Korea and say educating very talented

517
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,200
people from the now listen ten years old

518
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,330
we cannot emulate such kind of system in

519
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,420
Japan so as you said so people are not

520
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,750
happy with the security business because

521
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,890
they cannot be rich so you have to

522
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,960
maintain hundred percent security in

523
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,450
your business so if you cannot do that

524
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,330
you will be blamed so why so why we were

525
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,030
breached so why get cyber attacks those

526
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,710
kind of things happens so they are very

527
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,480
frustrated they don't want to go to

528
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,790
business they want to go to IT dot-com

529
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,090
business for money so security is not a

530
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,120
good business in Japan in North Korea

531
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,260
you can be a have a good life for cyber

532
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,450
security so that's why they are very

533
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,590
positive to seek talents technologies in

534
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,420
North Korea that's very different we

535
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,690
cannot imitate but but but as we know

536
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,840
that North the North Korean well the

537
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,150
whole structures so completely different

538
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,270
I mean what but what could we what can

539
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,700
we learn about how what we should do

540
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,830
differently from the experiences that

541
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,770
you've seen in China Japan or South

542
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,960
Korea North Korea what could we do

543
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,330
differently what could we do differently

544
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,270
in our universities so or before as you

545
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,210
put it to to fix Stefan's problem I'm

546
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,670
spending a lot of years to educate young

547
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,090
people but most talented young Japanese

548
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,420
people are hired by Google see I was

549
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,450
right I was right that's right yeah

550
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,620
and I agree with you completely we you

551
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,299
know if you're waiting to you know till

552
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,549
they get to Google or to CERN it's it's

553
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,799
far too late we need to make

554
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,059
cybersecurity cool we need to make it so

555
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,760
people want to go into cybersecurity one

556
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,500
of the things we're advocating is we

557
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,480
should be accessing the gaming community

558
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,549
we've got hundreds of thousands of kids

559
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,549
who are engaging in these games

560
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,770
why don't we leverage that why don't we

561
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,600
go after that and try to work with the

562
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,640
gaming community to build cybersecurity

563
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
into the games and then go to them when

564
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,780
they're 8 9 10 11 and say you know you

565
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,909
can make your whole living doing this

566
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,400
kind of thing it's cool and advertise

567
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,370
you know and put up attractive models we

568
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,900
have a certain one of my members is the

569
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,850
center for equality it was a similar

570
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,260
problem to cybersecurity everybody

571
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,700
thinks this Center for what's right what

572
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,740
it quality okay so the auditors they

573
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,270
have a real problem getting people to

574
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,620
want to be auditors because it looks

575
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,690
really boring and so what they've done

576
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,280
is they've done an advertising program

577
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,380
where they get really attractive

578
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,590
cool-looking good-looking people to be

579
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,900
their spokespeople and little kids look

580
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,669
at oh yeah I want to be like that I mean

581
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,260
we're supposed to be good at marketing

582
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,590
you know but we do not market

583
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,640
cybersecurity we should be marketing at

584
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,850
a young age yeah very good kisser

585
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,350
even it happens even before we have to

586
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,270
market it I think it's this is about a

587
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:42,870
culture right and when yeah when we look

588
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,090
at our students and when we look at what

589
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,890
we're doing right now in the schools we

590
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,020
are giving children iPads in first grade

591
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,179
to teach them how to read we're giving

592
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,530
them Chromebooks to teach them how to

593
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,990
write to do math there is no reason why

594
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,760
when they get that they shouldn't be

595
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,890
educated on what it means I think that

596
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,960
goes to Stefan's point when we talk

597
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
about creating a culture it is very

598
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,230
difficult the same way it is difficult

599
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,480
to both on security to a to a product at

600
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,520
the end it's extremely difficult to bolt

601
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,830
on security to a mindset we all know

602
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,510
from languages if you learn a language

603
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,070
when you're born and you can learn two

604
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,289
or three very easily at a young age it's

605
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,760
a lot more difficult to learn that

606
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,159
second language when you're 30 35 40 it

607
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,440
actually exponentially increases by 10

608
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,450
years when we think about in the United

609
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,430
States recycling and Comp

610
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,290
those are the kids right now that are

611
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,490
teaching the adults because they're

612
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,950
learning it in school it has been a part

613
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,300
of how they're learning and how they've

614
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,970
been been raised when we think about

615
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,790
cybersecurity where our responsibility

616
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,740
lies is teaching our children at a very

617
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,059
young age we've already made the

618
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,830
decision to bring the technology into

619
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,570
the classrooms there's absolutely no

620
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,920
reason why we shouldn't be bringing the

621
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,690
security into the classrooms the point

622
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,460
that was raised earlier though was how

623
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,559
do you get the teachers to be trained to

624
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,850
teach them that I think that's a very

625
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,500
important issue and we need to be

626
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,420
focusing on that but there is basic

627
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,059
cyber hygiene that continues to be the

628
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,250
source of so much vulnerability across

629
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,020
industry that actually could be taught

630
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,120
to a first-grader about authentication

631
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,040
and what it means to be secure and what

632
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,170
you do when you log on and log off that

633
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,730
we're still trying to teach adults and I

634
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,650
think that that elementary education

635
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,780
piece is what's been very missing in

636
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,250
most societies I don't want to I don't

637
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,679
want to do is out of a possible repeat

638
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,120
appearance and they say it's conference

639
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,410
but maybe you should have some school

640
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,200
children as a panel talking about their

641
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
attitudes you know I'm a I am serious

642
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,970
I'm not we should drop the dress code I

643
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,230
needed to get a suit for here I ever

644
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,720
think geek t-shirt with me and I wanted

645
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,610
to come with jeans and then see business

646
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,800
code business whatever not business

647
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,340
casual so thank you very much next time

648
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,070
would be fine do you have any thoughts

649
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,650
on what on generally I want to come back

650
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,450
to it to thinking about like our users

651
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,400
and and as we're talking about humans

652
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,020
right like it's certainly very very true

653
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,330
what we need to invest in educating

654
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,450
people and then early on I agree with

655
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,830
that right about cyber hygiene about the

656
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,670
important elements what they need to

657
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,350
know I think it's also important that we

658
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,000
give them the tools and the products as

659
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,980
well they can actually do that in a

660
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,200
reasonable way right one of the things

661
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,240
that we have been developing in my group

662
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
is what we call the security checkup and

663
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,800
we are seeing that like 700 million

664
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,720
users per year are actually doing that

665
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,820
whether we are going prove is like three

666
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,460
to five minute thing and to actually

667
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,679
check on where security preferences and

668
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,160
and and the idea there is not bad but

669
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,660
you have to be an expert to actually

670
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,190
adjust all of these settings but we are

671
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,280
giving you kind of a head

672
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,750
this way of saying like you think this

673
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,880
is better for you and and this is the

674
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,530
choice but you should be making and this

675
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,430
is the choice that you should not be

676
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,260
making everything this is insecure right

677
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,510
and I think we can do a lot more to

678
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,400
actually help out our users so that it's

679
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,620
part of a system - right it's not on the

680
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,780
user and on cyma hygiene only but it

681
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,000
also needs to be in the design of the

682
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,540
system

683
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,120
well we forget who it was Matt even

684
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,910
Julian mentioned the Internet of Things

685
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,130
and the growing you know oh no I think

686
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,520
it was Alexander mentioned the need to

687
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,000
have security by design built in even

688
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,100
more important now that we've got you

689
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,780
know all sorts of devices attached I

690
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,840
mean that how how would you feel that we

691
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,700
should do that I mean the stories of

692
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,430
people having their security setting the

693
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,860
passwords of zero zero zero zero one two

694
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,190
three four on devices attached to the

695
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,990
Internet of Things boom what should we

696
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,900
do in order to get that culture out into

697
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,210
the wider community of Internet of

698
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,680
Things suppliers and devices so and I

699
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,950
think as I said I think we can do a

700
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,950
number of technological steps as well to

701
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,560
make people aware of weak passwords

702
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,370
things that are kind of bad hygiene

703
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,830
right getting bit out into a wider

704
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,440
community of suppliers and I think that

705
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,200
requires an effort all across the

706
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,620
industry right it's basically sync on

707
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,450
what is kind of the standard that we

708
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,700
want to have for passwords all across

709
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,830
right here we are living in a world

710
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,140
where most of the breaches which we are

711
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,660
seeing are coming from things like

712
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,880
collection one writes databases of pests

713
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,750
but username/password

714
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,570
dumps right that is still the most of

715
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,920
the breaches source of most of the

716
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,320
pitches that we are seeing for our users

717
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,820
accounts as passed by Thomas where the

718
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,220
same password was used all across and

719
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,110
and I think we can actually get rid of

720
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,380
that by making people aware of it and

721
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,630
also by having a standard of like what

722
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,630
it should be for an account in any kind

723
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,060
of scenario I mean we we said we talked

724
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,790
about staff and then users and so it's

725
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,010
it's good we've got we've got onto users

726
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,960
I mean I'm interested in

727
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,850
this point about not putting too big a

728
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,860
burden on the users and it ties back to

729
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,120
your point I mean the the sort of

730
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,910
economic cost of you could also think in

731
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,800
terms of the hassle cost being an

732
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,140
economic factor if we if we say if you

733
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,370
want to be secure it's going to take you

734
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,140
ten minutes before you load up you know

735
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,410
we'll get going how do we deal with this

736
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,430
issue of making it easy to be secure as

737
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,690
well as secure by design first some

738
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,980
other statements I think we should start

739
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,960
with pupils with really with the kids

740
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,360
where don't agree what you've done in

741
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,500
the upload shop with the iPhone and I

742
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,610
think they could just got the defaults

743
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,260
wrong so we have to convince Apple to

744
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,940
get the come to work on defaults right

745
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,770
from the very beginning but what I still

746
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,480
wonder you mentioned awareness-raising

747
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,490
I'm doing awareness-raising training and

748
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,260
in-depth training and posters and videos

749
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,360
and online courses and games and serious

750
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,340
gaming and so on why do I have to be at

751
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,440
the cost why do I have to be the cost to

752
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,110
teach this to adults why are the kids

753
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,090
are not learning this and if you

754
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,680
remember this risk equation there's also

755
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,630
the vulnerability part there are two

756
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,880
products worldwide and this is not for

757
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,240
me

758
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,850
somebody said some women where I'm as

759
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,890
the end user I'm using Internet of

760
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,270
Things device and all the things for

761
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,370
buying everything digital why do I need

762
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,700
to be at the cost for security there's a

763
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,920
second product so why on software and

764
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,140
hardware security I have to pay and not

765
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,060
the producer and where's the second

766
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,030
product drugs so this doesn't work

767
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,910
together so I'm wondering where are the

768
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,110
government's I don't need to have

769
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,550
certification because this is just one

770
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:25,000
one time thing where the government's

771
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,040
starting with enforcing back bounty

772
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,110
programs so I don't know whether you are

773
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,760
running back bounty programs but I think

774
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,190
government should enforce this and I

775
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,290
tell you why for the financial incentive

776
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,400
and there might be a long discussion

777
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,420
says here's my proposal you oblige

778
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,040
companies who producing hardware

779
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,160
software to pay $100 if I find a

780
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,960
cross-site scripting vulnerability in

781
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,740
that one 1005 square injection 10,000

782
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,080
for he just fixed by catalog and the

783
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,330
owner of the software has to pay to the

784
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,280
first finder so now the company has a

785
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,410
choice invest the money in paying me

786
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,390
fine invest the money in the third-party

787
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,270
company doing security for them or

788
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,310
investing in their own processes

789
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,770
of course is not $100 it's proportional

790
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,260
to the distribution of the software and

791
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,360
for open-source and that's the bad news

792
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,850
is government needs to jump in so hope

793
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,250
and sauce government has to pay but I

794
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,080
think this would give all the script

795
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,460
kiddies all the youngsters who would

796
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,500
like to do security and incentive

797
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,170
because cash counts it will even give

798
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,390
some of the script kiddies a chance to

799
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,190
not sell on the undie on the black

800
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,240
market but coming to the legal world

801
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,250
thoughts about this then low because it

802
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,990
does seem to me you said people don't

803
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,910
want to pay for security and if you

804
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,740
followed that model the software would

805
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,160
just cost more wouldn't it because i

806
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,300
haven't analyzed that model it's an

807
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,010
interesting idea i'd like to think about

808
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,480
it but what i can take so we have

809
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,260
thought a lot about incentives and and

810
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,150
indifferent incentives will work for

811
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,370
different groups you know and i think

812
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,080
more at an industrial level rather than

813
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,160
a consumer level but for example and

814
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,350
what we advocate is what we need to do

815
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,040
is rebalance the economic model so that

816
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,190
it is in the organization's best

817
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,670
interest profit motive to build security

818
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,280
in so let's take IOT for an example it's

819
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,950
a big problem and an ADD model is by the

820
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,440
way we have incentives throughout the

821
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,960
economy in all sorts of different areas

822
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,160
that we haven't applied to cybersecurity

823
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,230
for example in pharmaceuticals least in

824
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,590
the u.s. in pharmaceuticals if if you

825
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,720
have a good track record with regard to

826
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,670
the safety of your drugs you get access

827
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,040
to a fast track method for patent

828
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,010
approval this is incredibly valuable you

829
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,600
know you're getting quickly to market is

830
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,070
really important and you're just on the

831
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,470
fast track it's not like you get through

832
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,330
automatically but you get to go first in

833
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,190
line why don't we give first in line to

834
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,260
people why don't we have a similar sort

835
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,690
of model for IOT devices where if you

836
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,210
have a good security record you get a

837
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,430
fast track with your next product coming

838
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,740
by now we've got the companies wanting

839
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,710
to to maintain this we could do the same

840
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,410
in regulated industries with audits if

841
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,790
if you know any of these industries I

842
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,170
can't stand on it so hey they're

843
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,000
expensive they're boring they're blah

844
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,620
blah blah blah they hate them you know

845
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,360
and they're really expensive and a lot

846
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,470
of times you have to do couple most

847
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,780
constant auditing how about if you get a

848
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,360
really

849
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,880
good audit you don't have to do one the

850
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,290
next year or the next quarter whatever

851
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,110
then you've got an incentive to keep up

852
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,960
that really good security record because

853
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,640
you don't want to go back into the old

854
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,720
system where you're doing wallets

855
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,549
quarterly as opposed to annually and

856
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,049
these I'm just offering us models

857
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,570
without going into details yeah back and

858
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,100
forth but I think that there are all

859
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,040
sorts in agriculture aviation ground

860
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,250
transport pharmaceuticals defense even

861
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,900
in security the Safety Act should be

862
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,020
applied better to cyber that we can just

863
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,580
take and apply to cyber security put our

864
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,260
fields are so young we haven't done that

865
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,790
yet Thank You April Walter the model

866
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,669
mice Harry you wanted to come in because

867
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,200
I'm a political scientist I don't

868
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,580
believe in economic model actually well

869
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,469
so one thing I want to take is a

870
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,619
reputation cause that's important so if

871
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,480
you lose a face in cybersecurity

872
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,830
so-and-so

873
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,770
companies the people are very very

874
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,310
frustrated so losing a face is a very

875
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,040
important factor but so hiding I drunk I

876
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,918
don't believe it in because it's very

877
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,770
difficult so these are people who care

878
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,770
security here in this room but I believe

879
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,960
more than 20% of the people do not

880
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,570
washing your hands in restaurant I'm

881
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,399
always watching people in security

882
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,918
conferences so people do not wash hands

883
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,230
so it's but people don't care so that's

884
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,780
important things so you can name it oh

885
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,000
you didn't wash your hands that's a

886
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,230
reputation of course that's the most

887
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,929
important thing okay Kirsten don't eat

888
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:02,930
the peanuts I think one of the things we

889
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,550
also have to appreciate is we talk as if

890
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,050
there's nothing happening and there's

891
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,820
clearly a lot happening and I know we're

892
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,440
gonna hear from Terry Halverson later

893
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,750
from Samsung I mean look at the products

894
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,250
that are out there that are doing this

895
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,960
well there are products that are out

896
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,520
there that are taking a look at this

897
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,890
what we haven't done well is cut across

898
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,140
the IOT space I think one of the

899
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,600
interesting pieces and we heard this

900
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,580
earlier that we're talking about digital

901
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,619
security for critical infrastructure and

902
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,960
we talked about data data is our most

903
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,850
critical asset right now and data is

904
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,920
held on everybody's device every

905
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,930
buddy holds critical data in their own

906
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,089
way we have to be thinking about how to

907
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,369
secure that data and also as we're

908
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:41,809
looking at these interdependencies

909
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:44,390
recognizing that we don't draw the line

910
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,880
at critical infrastructure

911
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,290
interdependencies IOT mean that our

912
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,940
critical infrastructure is linked to

913
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,920
that which is not critical and so when

914
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,839
we look across our culture when we look

915
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,490
across security we have to do a better

916
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,799
job at looking at as Alexander was

917
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:58,790
talking earlier whole-of-government

918
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,069
whole of culture whole of Commerce

919
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:02,839
because we're trying to secure the

920
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,549
digital economy which is an intersection

921
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:06,770
of industry government nonprofit

922
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,480
academia all these other elements and

923
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,250
we've got to be looking at that without

924
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,140
distinguishing and differentiating our

925
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,540
own models for security because it all

926
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,700
requires a baseline level in order to

927
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,650
raise the bar for security across the

928
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,740
board I'm I'm gonna if it's ok with you

929
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,599
because we started a little bit late I

930
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,299
will aim to finish at 22 which gives us

931
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:28,369
just over a little a little over 15

932
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,079
minutes hope that's okay

933
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,540
and I promised the panel that this

934
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,549
audience was a really engaged audience

935
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:36,079
with great questions and I'd like to

936
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,420
give you the opportunity to maybe make a

937
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,579
few of those points so art if you've got

938
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,740
some if you've got some questions or

939
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,170
points you want to make let me know but

940
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,569
just before we do that most Hiro when we

941
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:51,079
were talking earlier in preparation for

942
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,119
this panel you refer to the cyber

943
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,339
warriors of China and North Korea now

944
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,780
you've hinted a little bit about their

945
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,030
you know how no North Korea goes about

946
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,069
the cyber warriors and so thinking about

947
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,770
that third group of people the the bad

948
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,660
actors what insights can you give us

949
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,260
into the cyber warriors and among the

950
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,910
bad guys that we might not know about

951
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,329
yeah I'm running a gjk I trucked to a

952
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,030
conference so China Japan Korea truck to

953
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,420
sort of scholars dialogue but we learned

954
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,790
that people say so cyber attacks coming

955
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,309
from China but there are five types of

956
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,420
people in China

957
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,329
so first frustrated young young people

958
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:32,030
so they graduate from the Beijing

959
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,369
University or chinfa University but they

960
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,780
cannot get a job so they are very

961
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,540
frustrated so they are having found to

962
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,000
attack foreign countries the second is

963
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,359
economic spies but actually so they are

964
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,059
so the Chinese are fighting with the

965
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:47,490
Chinese

966
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,110
Chinese companies are fighting with

967
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,210
Chinese they are stealing information a

968
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,690
lot and so we our foreign governments

969
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,030
foreign companies also victims the third

970
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,470
is political spies

971
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,680
so spies under the Ministry of State

972
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,930
Security they never stopped cyber

973
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,480
espionage so they are just using cyber

974
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,330
technologies in addition to existing

975
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:14,340
technologies and force is PLA so people

976
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,260
Liberation Army see but they are not

977
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,540
using the final card yet so they are

978
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,380
preparing for future war and finally so

979
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,600
the mass analyst all yours so you can be

980
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,810
hired by anyone so they do not care any

981
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,530
victims as they can do not care any

982
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,050
employee employers so it's very

983
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,060
difficult to distinguish these five

984
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,790
types of people so we do not say it's

985
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,330
coming from China or Chinese person or

986
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,770
Chinese company it's quite a difficult

987
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,410
to divulge you differentiate these types

988
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,770
of people in as much as you can or are

989
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,260
able to reveal I mean are you you taking

990
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,140
any particular steps to defend against

991
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,690
the bad actors I mean is this the sort

992
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,730
of intelligence that you might be

993
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,500
deploying as much as you prepared to say

994
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,550
I mean it is a bad actors on the rises

995
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,570
it's something that's becoming more

996
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,390
important to you yeah absolutely I mean

997
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,119
we're not talking about details but it's

998
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,590
obviously and there has always been an

999
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,080
arms race and one of the things that we

1000
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,550
are definitely seeing is the

1001
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,220
sophistication of the attacks is growing

1002
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,250
and it's growing drastically and I

1003
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,420
hinted at bad it's not only for for like

1004
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,280
very special targets but it's also

1005
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,380
growing all across right I said like

1006
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,820
everybody here in this room can get fish

1007
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,890
right phishing attacks are growing

1008
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,050
massively we block about in Gmail we

1009
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,790
block about 10 million emails per minute

1010
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,770
but are not reaching the inbox but as

1011
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,390
the sophistication level is growing

1012
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,210
right there is messages that are very

1013
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,560
very hard even with machine learning

1014
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,970
technology and everything that we have

1015
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,630
to defend against and so the the

1016
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,190
sophistication level is something that

1017
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,930
we are seeing is clearly on the rise and

1018
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,460
that is a hard work that we have to do

1019
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,470
and when you're not tearing your hair

1020
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,000
out about the students so you've done

1021
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,770
quite a good job on that by the way and

1022
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,180
when you're not tearing your hair else

1023
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,220
about the students do you spend a lot of

1024
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,079
your time worrying about really bad

1025
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,450
actors if I worry then of course I worry

1026
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,920
swell we are permanently I'm not

1027
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,119
attacked like everybody else in this

1028
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,520
room and we're just following this

1029
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,930
malformed the problem with Malcolm is

1030
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,670
you don't know how long it do it didn't

1031
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,490
take you and what's the path is so we're

1032
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,750
trying to adapt again and again again

1033
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,920
we've seen the whole spectrum we see

1034
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,440
script kitties and the white hats which

1035
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,970
are just poking our systems you have

1036
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,500
retraining even students poking all

1037
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,630
systems and then you got cyber criminals

1038
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,300
fishing one acquires been mentioned

1039
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,309
before but we have seen up to our nation

1040
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,200
states of hacking us for one of the

1041
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,849
other reasons and then you have to see

1042
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,589
no it's the arms race how much money do

1043
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,710
we have to defend and where you have to

1044
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,420
stop in also you have to accept that

1045
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,690
CERN is we're coming every year 15,000

1046
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,339
scientists from every country this one's

1047
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,589
world students professors physicists

1048
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,390
engineers secretaries technicians from

1049
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,770
all over the from all over the world any

1050
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,059
country and I'm saying literally any

1051
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,400
country maybe not North Korea but all

1052
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,619
the others so I can't do any background

1053
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:07,730
checks on those people this is

1054
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,799
technically impossible for me and even

1055
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:11,960
in the academic world is not appreciated

1056
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,780
during this so I have already certain

1057
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,849
people on site just by statistics who

1058
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,339
might have an evil intend against my

1059
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,230
organization so and this is something I

1060
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,609
have to face with this for physical and

1061
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:24,410
cyber land that meets and this is the

1062
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,780
idea hoddan that I'm facing remotely it

1063
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,579
has to go in somewhere if you on the Sun

1064
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:31,790
side you got much more possibilities so

1065
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,309
um I hope you think that that has been a

1066
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,950
valuable discussion ladies gentlemen and

1067
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,980
got the first panel off to a good start

1068
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,890
you will all take different things away

1069
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,099
from it I with a few random things I

1070
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:49,819
took away from it five types of bad guys

1071
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:51,650
in China I mean could be anywhere else

1072
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,970
but I mean I think that's quite a good

1073
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,700
categorization I've always liked the

1074
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,799
idea of incentives of one form or

1075
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,450
another not necessarily financial ever

1076
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,030
since I read the book about nudge you

1077
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,380
know about how to change people's

1078
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,819
behavior by using the appropriate

1079
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,500
incentives it's not just about

1080
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,599
regulation despite what we might think

1081
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,670
here very commonly in Europe it's not

1082
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,049
just about financial incentives there

1083
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:14,900
are other incentives too but the

1084
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,549
really most of all I took away from it

1085
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:19,250
get rid of your ties stop wearing dark

1086
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,589
suits and let's try and make it cool so

1087
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:23,750
that's out of a job so thank you very

1088
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,070
much ladies and gentlemen

1089
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:31,230
[Applause]

1090
