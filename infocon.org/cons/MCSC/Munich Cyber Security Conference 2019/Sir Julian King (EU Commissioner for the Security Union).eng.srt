2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,940
I hope that we can avoid a complete

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,549
meltdown despite the title that you've

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,220
chosen this year but I do have to

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,400
recognize that in the 12 months since we

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,550
were last together quite a lot has

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,850
happened and some of it is quite

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,450
challenging the cyber threat landscape

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,140
has changed significantly the security

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,090
challenges we face from cyber attacks

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,430
and other cyber enabled threats have

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,370
continued to evolve and have continued

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,969
to grow we find ourselves battling to

14
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,649
prevent our elections from being

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,780
interfered with combating attempts at

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,489
manipulation through the malicious use

17
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,670
of disinformation but the topic which

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,039
has grabbed the most headlines so far

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,699
this year in 2019 is in some ways an

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,870
even bigger challenge how best protect

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,380
our digital critical infrastructure an

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,320
issue that goes beyond the simple

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,299
question of whether or not we should

24
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,180
allow who our way to build our 5g

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,860
networks what we need to think about is

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,810
how do we strengthen our digital

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,859
resilience as a whole digital resilience

28
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,740
after all is crucial for protecting

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,990
government information industrial

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,079
research intellectual property business

31
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,719
plans elections and democratic

32
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,570
institutions as well as protection of

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,560
our personal data and to do this we need

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,560
to protect that digital infrastructure

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,990
the essential plumbing of our modern

36
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,249
connected lives fight G but also the

37
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:57,829
cloud and AI at present as as you know

38
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,119
European companies collectively have

39
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,659
about 30% of the 5g market that's good

40
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,109
but some but they're challenged they're

41
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,520
more expensive than the competition

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,250
meanwhile more than 90% of our IT

43
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,180
devices are made in Asia notably in

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,120
China and China control 70%

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,650
global supply of the critical raw

46
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,610
materials you need to make those devices

47
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,830
US and Chinese investment in AI de

48
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,940
wharfs European investment for example

49
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,250
France has just declared a program which

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,150
is very welcome

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,409
investing 1.5 billion euros in AI over

52
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,959
the same time scale a single city in

53
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,040
China

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,200
changjun is investing 13.5 billion euros

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,680
this kind of dependency inevitably

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,489
creates risks and vulnerabilities

57
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,290
the US has moved protect its own cutting

58
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,849
edge technologies often using the

59
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,190
Committee on foreign investments and us

60
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,069
screening process its reacted to the new

61
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,200
Chinese National Intelligence law which

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,390
is you know obliges Chinese companies to

63
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,640
work with Chinese intelligence by

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,650
banning US government agencies from

65
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,950
using who are wäôre said teehee and is

66
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,190
encouraging other countries to do

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,769
likewise China for its part has long

68
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,560
guarded and controlled access to its

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,169
domestic market while vigorously

70
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,150
pursuing international expansion in

71
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,970
infrastructure real as well as digital

72
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,109
so in my view it's high time for Europe

73
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:40,950
to make some choices it's time to

74
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,900
discuss whether we want to continue as

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,760
now to see our own cutting-edge

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,299
technologies sold off one after another

77
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,410
we also need to consider whether it

78
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,299
makes sense for individual countries to

79
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,690
let out there 5g spectrum with little or

80
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,750
no coordination on what others are doing

81
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,109
which inevitably risks allowing one

82
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,150
dominant supplier to emerge across the

83
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,090
continent better coordination would also

84
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,269
help our collective investment in AI and

85
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,919
other vital technologies quantum

86
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,260
computing cryptography and others to be

87
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,190
more than the sum of its parts and these

88
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,579
issues raise raise challenges around

89
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,919
national decision-making which won't be

90
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,070
easy to resolve trying to protect

91
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,580
everything won't work we need to decide

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,740
what really matters in terms of the

93
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,260
digital ecosystem and whether greater

94
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,020
transparency

95
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,690
see around suppliers supply chains for

96
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,660
an investment is enough to offset the

97
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,930
security risks it may be that some

98
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,430
pieces of backbone digital

99
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,890
infrastructure are simply too critical

100
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,010
to risk again these issues are

101
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,890
inherently geopolitical so the solutions

102
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,960
in my view need to reflect Europe's

103
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,600
particular perspective based around

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,490
keeping markets open and trade fair

105
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,890
security concerns are not an excuse for

106
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,890
arbitrary protectionism but equally we

107
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,890
can't ignore them

108
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,150
these aren't issues that can be settled

109
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,370
overnight we're going to need time to

110
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,750
debate and develop a comprehensive

111
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,020
approach but we should also be asking

112
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,040
ourselves what can be done now already

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,530
using the terms and conditions and the

114
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,450
instruments that we already have in

115
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,610
place first the EU has approved a

116
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,070
cybersecurity act which is going to

117
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,680
reinforce the mandate of the EU

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,930
cybersecurity agency to better support

119
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,120
Member States in tackling cyber security

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,430
threats and attacks the Act also

121
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,200
establishes an EU framework for

122
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,170
cybersecurity certification boosting the

123
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,570
cybersecurity of online services and

124
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,320
consumer devices I think we can expect

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,050
5g infrastructure Internet of Things

126
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,320
devices to be an important part of the

127
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,300
agency's work salute the head of the

128
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,240
agency who's sitting here with us second

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,420
under the directive on security of

130
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,490
network and information systems the so

131
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,740
called NIST directive all member states

132
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,130
have to adopt a national strategy

133
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,420
defining the objectives and appropriate

134
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,160
appropriate policy and regulatory

135
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,710
measures this includes designating at

136
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,750
least one competent authority to monitor

137
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,490
the application of the directive at

138
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,530
national level and to nominate a point

Europe's got one too

144
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,020
once it's in force will allow the

145
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,030
Commission of member states to cooperate

146
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,580
in their assessment of security risks

147
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,090
raise specific concerns posed by foreign

148
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,800

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,060
pursues new opportunities for European

157
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,280
companies by ensuring reciprocity and

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,650
better protect our critical digital

173
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,919
infrastructure but it also requires the

174
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,819
political will to act it's important

175
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,379
that we're gonna have to continue this

176
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,000
discussion we need to consider all of

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,469
these elements if we're going to face up

178
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,509
to this challenge as far as the

179
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:09,909
Commission is concerned we will continue

180
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,849
to push this agenda and work as closely

181
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,060
as we can with the Member States

182
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,039
meanwhile we're faced with with some

183
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,900
other challenges as well the pernicious

184
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,569
threat from the use of disinformation

185
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,819
and the manipulation of data and

186
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,339
behavior particularly important in

187
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,409
relation to the security of our

188
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,949
elections and democratic processes

189
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,940
malicious actors both state and

190
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,760
non-state are increasingly using digital

191
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,339
tools to seek to interfere in our

192
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,529
democratic processes and to manipulate

193
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,260
public opinion the European Parliament

194
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,690
elections are now just a few short

195
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,300
months away and I'm afraid they present

196
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,779
a particularly tempting target that's

197
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,850
why we've called on the Internet

198
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,550
companies back in April last year to

199
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,170
take urgent actions through a voluntary

200
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,329
code of practice the code was eventually

201
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:02,440
agreed in September

202
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,180
and we followed that up with an action

203
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,129
plan on disinformation at the end of

204
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,519
last year in the longer term we're going

205
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,800
to need to do more to ensure media

206
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,230
diversity and to build critical

207
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,600
awareness we're going to need to

208
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,360
continue to improve media literacy for

209
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,980
example through using tools like the

210
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,829
news guard browser which utilizes a team

211
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,480
of journalists to check the credibility

212
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,759
of news media against a transparent list

213
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,300
of criteria in order to give credible

214
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,089
sites a green tick and potential sources

215
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,569
of disinformation a red cross it helps

216
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,970
to give users a sense of the provenance

217
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,509
of what it is that they are seeing but

218
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,670
we also need to look at other sorts of

219
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,579
more immediate action we need to see an

220
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,889
improvement in how we detect and call

221
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,769
out examples of disinformation the

222
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:54,790
Commission has something called the

223
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,370
Stratcom task force that does that work

224
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,500
we're building something called the EU

225
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,300
hybrid fusion cell which will reinforce

226
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,329
it we need to continue to reinforce our

227
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,870
work with the Member States and we are

228
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,480
building a new disinformation rapid

229
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,550
alert system in advance of those

230
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,579
European Parliament elections and we

231
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,620
need to see the Internet platforms step

232
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,139
up and make real progress on the

233
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,509
commitments that they signed up to in

234
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:25,089
the code of practice those commitments

235
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,310
include urgent improvement in how

236
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,709
adverts are placed online greater

237
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,889
transparency around sponsored content

238
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:34,689
rapid and effective identification and

239
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,139
deletion of fake accounts clearer rules

240
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,209
around bots though personally I don't

241
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,310
know why we allow bots to circulate

242
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,040
political information at all more

243
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,509
effective promotion of alternative

244
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,600
narratives greater clarity around how

245
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,550
the algorithms are operating in the

246
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,610
political space all of this subject to

247
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,329
independent oversight and audit last

248
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,579
month we published a report on the

249
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,110
progress that was being made against

250
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,959
these objectives which recognized that a

251
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,509
lot of good work had been done but also

252
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,339
underline the concerns that we still

253
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,579
have about the slow pace of progress

254
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,050
we're going to need to go further and

255
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,760
faster

256
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,170
if these efforts are to have the

257
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,630
required impact needed ahead of the

258
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,700
European parliamentary elections in May

259
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,980
we're going to report every month

260
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,130
between now and then frankly to maximise

261
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,520
the pressure and get progress in the

262
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,880
time remaining we're also continuing to

263
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,810
implement our proposals from 2017 to

264
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,640
address the more classic cybersecurity

265
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,120
threats targeting systems and data we're

266
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,100
continuing to roll out the new

267
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,800
cybersecurity strategy in order to build

268
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,140
our resilience strengthen deterrence and

269
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,150
sport member states in cyber defense

270
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,730
that includes the creation of a genuine

271
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,890
European cyber security agency as I

272
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,810
mentioned as well as a network of

273
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,000
competent centers to improve our

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,390
resilience and target our research we've

275
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,580
taken important steps on deterrence to

276
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,680
create real and credible disincentives

277
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,000
for those who might contemplate

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,490
attacking us including improving law

279
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,560
enforcement access to electronic

280
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
evidence we've put in place a set of

281
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,420
measures for a joint EU diplomatic

282
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
response to malicious cyber activities

283
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,890
which includes working together with

284
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,320
third countries and the possibility of

285
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,570
restrictive measures indeed we're now in

286
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,330
the process of refining a cyber six

287
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,330
actions regime and working to tackle

288
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,160
some of the challenges around for

289
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,700
example attribution our efforts to

290
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,620
strengthen cyber security across the

291
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,360
European Union whether in the short

292
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,740
medium or long term need to continue

293
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,880
whatever happens in the European

294
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
elections whatever happens with a new

295
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,420
commission whatever happens around

296
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,750
brexit the malicious actors who seek to

297
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,820
harm us are not going anywhere

298
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,480
and it's only by working together all

299
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,990
across Europe that we can successfully

300
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,110
tackle these threats and avoid the risk

301
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,050
of a security melter thank you thank you

302
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,220
very much
