2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,110
what I would like to talk about today is

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,670
I would like to talk about innovation

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,519
and R&D and I would like to talk about

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,240
that because to remain competitive in

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
technologically advanced areas

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,010
governments companies research

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,680
institutions universities compete in

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,859
this area so a lot of money goes into

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,340
research R&D development innovation

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,730
around the world and the point I want to

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,600
make today is that about two things one

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,910
I believe that the subject matter we are

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,640
all here for cybersecurity I think it's

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,739
completely under invested seeing the

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,230
money which goes into R&D in all the

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,690
other fields and the second piece is

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,809
then that I believe that Europe in

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,809
particular should reassess its success

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,270
formula of how to successfully innovate

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,690
in areas like automation artificial

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,810
intelligence automation robotics and so

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,680
on and so forth

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,200
and to give you a little flavor of what

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm talking about I would like to give

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,500
you some numbers the global R&D spend is

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,390
estimated well it depends on which

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,180
Research Institute you look at it ranges

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,860
between one point seven and two trillion

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,320
US dollars which is a Han lot of money

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
there's a lot of money if you break it

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,329
down you have two countries actually

33
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,579
covering more than half which is the

34
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,340
United States with above 500 billion and

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,329
China almost reaching 500 billion I

36
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,390
think China is probably the country with

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,670
the fastest growth in R&D in innovation

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,680
over the last 10 years they catched up

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,280
significantly if you take the top five

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,640
spenders they all come from the United

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,119
States

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,360
it's Microsoft its alphabet it's Apple

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
is Amazon and it's Facebook take over

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,848
already seventy billion and you are only

45
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,250
spend that's quite a lot isn't it just

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,230
five companies so you see where the

47
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,020
accumulation is Germany is the only

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,330
country in the European Union amongst

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,480
the top five spenders in R&D in the

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,580
world with crossing roughly 100 billion

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,440
Europe itself counts for roughly 300

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,060
billion so it's also worthwhile to look

53
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,220
at the venture capital market venture

54
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,530
capital market last year was covering

55
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,660
200 billion in investment and the

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,580
venture capital market is interesting to

57
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,860
look at because there's a lot of new

58
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,959
stuff going on in smaller companies and

59
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,790
things where there's a lot of hope that

60
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,250
it takes off once knew at some point of

61
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,380
time and if we take the 200 billion only

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,780
two and a half percent so five billion

63
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,500
is spent in cybersecurity I think those

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,330
companies are highly valued and there's

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,489
a lot of money going into it but it's

66
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:08,050
only two-and-a-half percent of the

67
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,290
venture capital market so if we take the

68
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,239
entire money but there's a lot of

69
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,000
industries and of course then I believe

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,850
that the security aspect in innovation

71
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,040
still is very short to the overall

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,959
amount so taking that looking at the

73
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,760
money that is one part of the equation

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,580
the second part of the equation is what

75
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,910
actually is a success formula for making

76
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,860
innovation happen so that you have

77
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,540
successful product solution and so on

78
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,200
and so forth

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,930
so if you look at the Chinese model it's

80
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,519
a very strong alignment between

81
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,160
government and corporates and

82
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,940
universities and however we will see

83
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,920
this from a security point of view from

84
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,320
a moral perspective I think regardless

85
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,110
of that it is actually very successful

86
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,190
how they do that they have created a lot

87
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,390
haven't they look at the United States

88
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,989
model it's a little different United

89
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,910
States very high risk and reward model

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,479
always thinking big it helps sometimes

91
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,779
actually they're like big companies they

92
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,940
think it's something good but when you

93
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,419
have developed something very large

94
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,490
and always looking for expansion and

95
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,310
domination I think if we combine those

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,659
formulas of course they are very like

97
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,960
shortcut now then I think that Europe

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,129
has no real path we're still searching

99
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,749
what the model is and maybe that's the

100
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,270
opportunity for us to formulate

101
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,150
something where Europe actually can play

102
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,759
a role because coming back to venture

103
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,960
capital from the 200 billion 100 billion

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,490
comes from United States in the mean

105
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,990
time 70 billion from China and 30 from

106
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,930
the rest of the world and amongst that

107
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,520
is Europe so we are under invested so

108
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,669
are there points which can be done I

109
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,629
personally think looking for the Big

110
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,610
Shot and for the moonshot it's a modern

111
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,439
word today I think it's always a bit

112
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,509
complicated but maybe there are small

113
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:16,979
things which can be done between

114
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,259
corporates and governments and I think

115
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,810
the first point maybe is that from a

116
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,279
government perspective and a corporate

117
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,120
perspective we can allow to reassess the

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,419
model of how we cooperate because

119
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,460
antitrust law is very strict in Europe

120
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,520
in particular in Germany and does it

121
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,310
really make sense that car makers all

122
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,439
develop their autonomous drive system

123
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,710
themselves right

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,990
I think cooperation can change a lot in

125
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,069
particular when it comes to digital

126
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,629
platforms it doesn't make sense that

127
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,669
everybody develops an underutilized

128
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,330
platform the second thing is that if you

129
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,430
look to the telecom industry does it

130
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,009
make sense to auction licensees for 5g

131
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,139
which is a critical infrastructure or

132
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,539
wouldn't it be better to actually give

133
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,479
an incentive or the license to them who

134
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,310
commit to the biggest R&D spent

135
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,009
thereafter because rolling it out cost

136
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,560
money but then where the applications

137
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,719
somebody has to do something as well so

138
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,569
maybe that model can be reassessed as

139
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,029
well so how things are being done that

140
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,830
small steps nothing big is required and

141
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,270
don't even have to change the law in

142
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,539
some areas so there might be

143
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,509
opportunities for Europe to change the

144
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,430
model to change the cooperation between

145
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,639
government and corporates to at times

146
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,710
also allow big players because

147
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,290
in some areas big players our goods is

148
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,670
not always bad to be big and in that

149
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,850
sense I believe that it is good to have

150
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,490
a strong and innovative United States or

151
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,550
North America and China will go its own

152
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,850
way anyway but that Europe plays a role

153
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,370
I think is inevitable we must have a

154
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,100
strong continent with strong allies in

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,310
Asia in order to win up things forward

156
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,250
and in that sense I believe also the

157
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,200
security world and cyber security can

158
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,120
step up because you would automatically

159
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,460
with the European mindset move a bit

160
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,030
more up with regard to security so I

161
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,440
kept my promise to be short and precise

162
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,780
the message was that I believe that

163
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,150
cyber security still is under invested

164
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,460
we can do a bit more and that Europe

165
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,640
maybe really finds its success formula

166
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,880
for being more innovative to compete in

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,730
the world space of technology thank you
