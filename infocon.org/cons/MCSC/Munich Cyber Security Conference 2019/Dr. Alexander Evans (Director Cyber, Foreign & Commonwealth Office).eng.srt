00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,950
it's a pleasure to be here in Germany I

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,049
was thinking about trying to sing my

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,450
oder Lindenberg songs but I remember

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,090
from being at school near Hanover in the

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,520
1970s but then for ty I should spare you

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,890
that infliction of a beginning of this

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,230
talk so it's very good to be here in

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,390
Germany for the fifth annual Munich

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,149
cybersecurity conference and clearly the

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,340
very nature of this conference

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,120
demonstrates the extent to which a

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
digital revolution has transformed the

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
world we live in digital connectivity

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,570
has already transformed everything about

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,330
our lives it's broken down geographical

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,310
and physical boundaries that were once a

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,080
barrier to our global communication and

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,390
collaboration it's made us increasingly

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,090
reliant upon new technologies and could

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,190
any of us imagine a life now without our

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,740
smartphones unless we are reading

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,510
survivalist manuals and retreating into

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,820
the mountains somewhere it's become such

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,530
an integral part I think of all our

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,140
lives from interacting with public

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,270
services to finding our way around

28
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,850
cities that we don't know I'm struck

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,530
I've just spent three years living in

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,960
India my daughter was born there her

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,820
digital birth certificate was delivered

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,920
in ten minutes for a new digital

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,500
government service one example of a way

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,850
in which this service delivery is

35
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,400
transforming away citizens interact with

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,820
with governments as our digitally

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,229
collected world has expanded an

38
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,299
extraordinary raids so too has a scale

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,130
of vulnerabilities and the frequency of

40
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,250
attacks that we face thousands of public

41
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,390
and private sector organizations

42
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,159
worldwide are falling victim to

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
ransomware attacks our supply chains are

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,590
being compromised our critical national

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,479
infrastructure continues to be a target

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,180
for attack from nation-states and cyber

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,700
criminals and we're seeing threats to

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,740
our democracies from attempted outside

49
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,290
interference that democratic practice

50
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,820
which is something that I think we as

51
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,049
Europeans hold so very dear it's right

52
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,729
in the face of these shared threats that

53
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,259
we stand together as international

54
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,200
partners and allies to confront expose

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,899
and disrupt hostile or malicious

56
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,720
activity and you will have seen our

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,819
attribution of a range of malicious

58
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,919
cyber attacks to the work of Russian

59
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,279
military intelligence this builds upon a

60
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,150
host of cyber

61
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,950
we have attributed with partners

62
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,379
including more wanna cry incidents one

63
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,360
of the most substantial to hit the UK in

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,120
terms of scale and disruption to North

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,720
Korean actors we must continue to affirm

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,180
our shared vision for an open peaceful

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,790
and secure digital world based on the

68
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,010
rule of law and the norms of behavior

69
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,980
and and one of the key ingredients in

70
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,290
map this year will be a renewed United

71
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,450
Nations negotiations that will begin in

72
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,360
the General Assembly this September both

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
through a a UN group of government

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,310
experts and through an open-ended

75
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,379
working group of a General Assembly and

76
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,849
that process I think will be the next

77
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,280
step in the international process of

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,459
trying to define and consolidate a set

79
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,290
of norms that all countries can

80
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,190
subscribe to and protecting our people

81
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,079
and the systems that we rely on and

82
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,750
democracy itself is an essential goal of

83
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,450
governments and that's why cybersecurity

84
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,670
must remain a top priority because it

85
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,980
impacts both our national security but

86
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,840
also our economic prosperity in the UK

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,359
we have really focused in recent years

88
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,329
on developing a national cyber security

89
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,450
strategy and recognizing market forces

90
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,160
alone we're not driving the step change

91
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,040
required the UK set out plans for a more

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,569
active and comprehensive response

93
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,129
through the national cybersecurity

94
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:48,510
strategy in 2016 in it we set out

95
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,459
ambitious proposals to take a more

96
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,079
interventionist role to defend our

97
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,900
people to deter our adversaries and

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,389
develop our capabilities both in

99
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,519
government and beyond and we did this to

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,109
ensure that the UK remains the safest

101
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,400
place to live and do business online and

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,959
one of the most visible elements for

103
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,699
strategy was the formation of a national

104
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,510
cyber security centre and this brought

105
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,070
together our best intelligence and

106
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,099
technical expertise into a single world

107
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:24,120
leading Authority supported by partners

108
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,729
the NCSC has undertaken some pioneering

109
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,909
work in its first two years and a key

110
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,169
strand of his work has been the

111
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,330
deployment of his active cyber defence

112
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,410
programme

113
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,750
these measures aim to enhance the UK's

114
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,520
national resilience by automatically

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,250
protecting UK Internet users from the

116
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,500
vast majority of crude high-volume

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,720
cyberattacks that affect people's

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,120
everyday lives reducing a burden on

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,880
individuals and small businesses it's

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,340
essentially automated cyber defense at

121
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,700
scale but we know that malicious cyber

122
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,200
actors will continue to adapt their

123
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,050
behavior in response and it's vital that

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,300
we continue revolutionising our approach

125
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,140
to keep pace with a fret and that's why

126
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,390
upskilling is such a key part of this in

127
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,750
government and beyond we shifted our

128
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,550
focus towards creating sustainable

129
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,760
structural change we've developed a

130
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
comprehensive cybersecurity skills

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,270
strategy that sets out proposals to

132
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,680
nurture and inspire the next generation

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,200
of cybersecurity professionals and

134
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,170
entrepreneurs not only will this help us

135
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,820
develop specialist talent but it will

136
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,710
also develop a cybersecurity profession

137
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,600
to create clear Park career pathways

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,030
building more diverse and inclusive

139
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,000
workforce and it provides a sustainable

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,230
pipeline to take us to 2021 and beyond

141
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,940
and even within the Foreign Office

142
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,510
itself we are we are an institution of

143
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,010
diplomats that are perhaps better known

144
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,220
for our adeptness with words for numbers

145
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,100
or big data the fact that within my part

146
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,420
of a foreign office we now have

147
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,200
behavioral scientists data analysts

148
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,570
sentiment analysts and people who can do

149
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,060
large end data work speaks to thee and

150
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,640
the early moves to develop capability

151
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,260
even within the foreign ministry space

152
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,020
to adopt and respond to the environment

153
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,470
we're in but to achieve this paradigm

154
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,850
shift in our approach we must bring

155
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,920
about a shift in mindset across society

156
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,110
as a whole and that relies on the

157
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,700
strength of the partnerships we create

158
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,880
and our ability to demystify and if you

159
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,910
like decode what cyber security actually

160
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,940
is while it's difficult to avoid

161
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,800
headlines about attacks and breaches

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
doing something about it is still often

163
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,270
seen as too technical or too difficult

164
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,680
or someone else's problem and cyber

165
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,389
Security's everyone's responsible

166
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,340
we consider it vital that all

167
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,319
organizations must embrace an embed

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,750
cybersecurity from the boardroom down

169
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,840
this is no longer a technical issue

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,659
it is a grand strategic and policy issue

171
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,180
for governments for private for the

172
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,629
private sector and for civil society and

173
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,520
that's why we've targeted our efforts in

174
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,919
the UK at driving long term change by

175
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,599
helping boards to better understand the

176
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,219
risks they face and to invest

177
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,710
appropriately we must ensure that

178
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,750
boardrooms provide active leadership to

179
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,699
ensure cybersecurity is ingrained into

180
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,300
organizational cultures and mindsets but

181
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,300
we can do more and that's why the UK is

182
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,190
also partnering with over 500 private

183
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,169
sector organisations for our national

184
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,990
cyber aware campaign to encourage

185
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,479
citizens and business to take the really

186
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,159
simple protective steps that can prevent

187
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,860
the majority of high volume low

188
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,169
sophistication attacks and at this

189
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,270
halfway point in the delivery of our

190
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,759
national cyber security strategy we put

191
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,229
in place many of the building blocks to

192
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,629
transform the UK cyber security and

193
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,810
resilience and these are demonstrating

194
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,810
clear results but we can never become

195
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,240
complacent just as a threat from cyber

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
criminals and nation states continues to

197
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,930
evolve so too must we continue to

198
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,120
innovate and refocus our efforts to

199
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,500
bring about a step change in our

200
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,860
response we want our citizens to reap

201
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,569
the benefits of connected technologies

202
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,029
we also want to realize our ultimate of

203
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,129
ambition to make all products and

204
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,370
services secure by design and if there's

205
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,589
one kind of banner heading that you'll

206
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,719
hear repeatedly I think from Britain as

207
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,729
a stakeholder in this debate it is this

208
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,129
phrase secured by design trying to

209
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,500
hardwire secure design into everything

210
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,409
that we do as the Internet of Things

211
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,479
continues to expand it can't be right

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,309
that consumers are left to secure their

213
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,620
own products the challenge is to

214
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,179
encourage manufacturers to help

215
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,890
consumers by building protections into

216
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,750
their design so it's easy for consumers

217
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,760
to ensure that their devices are secure

218
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,730
as for homes that they live in while

219
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,350
this will take global cooperation to fix

220
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,660
we developed a new code of practice for

221
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,149
consumer internet connected devices such

222
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,720
as smart home assistance and toys

223
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,130
alongside other measures such as Keynes

224
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,810
my guidance on smart devices in my home

225
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,490
we're trying to shift the burden of

226
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,230
security away from consumers

227
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,250
international collaboration is obviously

228
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,920
a key part of is the successes so far in

229
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,240
delivering our national cybersecurity

230
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,040
strategy have been driven by close

231
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,180
partnership working with the

232
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,490
cybersecurity community in the UK and

233
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,920
beyond a continuation of that

234
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,510
collaborative partnership approach is

235
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,430
crucial to any future success we may

236
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,550
have and Wiest we put our money where

237
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,770
our mouth is on this not only do we work

238
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,020
closely with like-minded States whether

239
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,090
in the european space or with other

240
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,340
partners internationally we are also

241
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,790
investing some 30 million pounds in

242
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,930
building cyber capacity in other

243
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,150
countries internationally we've also

244
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,670
invested in one of the lead centers for

245
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,710
thinking about cyber security at oxford

246
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,170
university and we support the journal of

247
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,720
cyber policy at Chatham House one of

248
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,730
Britain's leading think tanks as part of

249
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,650
again our commitment to encourage a

250
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,990
debate as well as to encourage ket

251
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,200
capacity-building we remain committed to

252
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,610
working with international partners to

253
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,500
develop and maintain our principles of a

254
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,170
free open peaceful and secure cyberspace

255
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,390
and we will continue to stand

256
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,950
shoulder-to-shoulder with international

257
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,020
partners to call out harmful behavior

258
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,030
that seeks to undermine the rules-based

259
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,150
international system and we welcome

260
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,800
recent initiatives including a paris

261
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
call for trust and security in

262
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,910
cyberspace and the OECD Global Forum on

263
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,950
digital security for Prosperity which

264
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,270
will help us meet our collective

265
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,890
challenge to ensure that our digital

266
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,480
economies are safe and secure I hope

267
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,010
I've been able to demonstrate today not

268
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,750
just that we understand the scale of a

269
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,730
challenge that we face but but we're

270
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,990
seeking to cultivate the right

271
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,030
environment so that we can be are at our

272
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,370
most collaborative and agile in response

273
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,830
and I understand you know the private

274
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,990
sector agility is one of the new

275
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,210
buzzwords for animates meetings around

276
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,780
the world

277
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,460
I think agility is something that we

278
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,900
should be bringing to the policy and

279
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,210
regulatory response in this space as

280
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,910
well as we face new challenges in the

281
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,290
year ahead we need to ensure that we

282
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,960
remain focused on reaching across

283
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,920
organizational political and

284
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,410
geographical boundaries government is

285
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,150
never going to be the sole source of

286
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,130
good ideas in this space is going to be

287
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,450
the private sector it is going to be

288
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,170
civil society

289
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,570
it is going to be clever load-bearing

290
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,089
conversations but cut across boundaries

291
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,640
and that you know developing that whole

292
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,930
of government and whole of society

293
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,930
approach is key to become more than the

294
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,209
sum of our individual parts so that we

295
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,040
can continue to protect the economic and

296
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,720
individual freedoms that make us

297
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,620
stronger together thank you
