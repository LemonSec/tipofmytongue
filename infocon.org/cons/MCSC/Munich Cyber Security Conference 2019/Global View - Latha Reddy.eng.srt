[Music]

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,950
as you heard my name is lotta ready I'm

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,799
a former Indian diplomat and as the

4
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,470
deputy national security of India

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,289
National Security Advisor of India was

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,290
responsible among other issues for

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,500
framing India's cyber policy which was

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,770
officially launched in 2013 and we take

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,509
pride in the fact that India is only the

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,969
third country in the world to launch a

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,730
cyber security policy currently I

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,120
describe myself as a cyber peace warrior

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,589
and I work on Internet governance the

14
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:49,659
formulation of norms cyber policies and

15
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:52,579
international cooperation I'm honored to

16
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,679
be the co-chair of the global Commission

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,739
on the stability of cyberspace which I

18
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,399
will now refer to as the GCSE in the

19
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,370
interest of time and I want to

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,320
especially mention that my chair marina

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,330
culture on this year and will be

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,600
speaking on the next panel and she's

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,340
going to tell you more about that though

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,369
I will touch on it in my remarks I've

25
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,700
been asked to speak on the global view

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,360
from India's perspective from India's

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,729
point of view our first priority perhaps

28
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,950
is to bring the largest population of

29
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,799
unconnected people in any country in the

30
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,789
world online if we need to bring them

31
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:42,170
into the digital era India is a paradox

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,090
we have the largest number of

33
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,670
unconnected people and the second

34
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,189
largest number of connected people in

35
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,950
the world so like everything else in

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,609
India it's a paradox we now have about

37
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:02,869
500 million people online and using

38
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,689
cyberspace but we have 800 million who

39
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,729
could conceivably be brought online in

40
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,479
the future

41
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
so for us our top priority is the

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,470
digital India initiative which way by

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,560
which we mean we use digitization to

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,180
empower to

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,750
distribute social welfare schemes

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,510
effectively to encourage inclusion give

47
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,810
the voiceless voice to educate and to

48
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,319
grow the economy

49
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,769
the second issue I'd say is of primary

50
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,260
importance to India would be the

51
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,670
critical information infrastructures

52
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,159
India as other countries gives the CII

53
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,239
is as I'll refer to them top priority

54
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,549
this could be highly sensitive systems

55
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,359
like nuclear and defense installations

56
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:59,169
intelligence agencies confidential in

57
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:03,109
confidential information or essential

58
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,950
areas like financial systems power

59
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,169
transport and these must receive utmost

60
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:12,169
priority when looking at cyber security

61
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,709
we need to build capability the estimate

62
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,040
is that we need anything between 500,000

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,859
to 1 million cyber security

64
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:23,889
professionals if we're to adequately

65
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:26,299
service all the requirements of

66
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,849
government industry and implement a

67
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,849
truly robust cyber security system all

68
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,470
of them don't have to be highly

69
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,870
qualified but everyone has to have some

70
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,989
basic idea of how to implement cyber

71
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:46,879
security now having ensured digital

72
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,109
inclusivity by connecting all Indians

73
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,519
and by building an adequate

74
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,129
cybersecurity system we need as a

75
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,419
country to also look at our views on

76
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,689
international cooperation global norm

77
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,109
building and Internet governance

78
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,579
India was always committed to these

79
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,769
areas but there has been a change

80
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,169
India has moved over the last few years

81
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,739
from backing multilateral solutions for

82
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,839
global cyber commitments as some of you

83
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,630
may remember to firmly committing itself

84
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,990
to a multi-stakeholder model but a

85
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,960
multi-stakeholder system that is more

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,719
fair and equitable recognizing that

87
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,430
cyberspace is if not a global Commons

88
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,490
least a global public good as India does

89
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,100
in other fields so also on global issues

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,880
we believe that multistakeholderism

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,770
needs to recognize the New World Order

92
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,110
and to bring in all governments on a

93
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,930
level playing field into the global

94
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,640
dialogue on cyber norms and

95
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,490
international cooperation

96
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,410
India's always followed all global

97
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,750
dialogues and participated wherever

98
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,780
possible and most of them all the UN

99
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,980
governmental group of experts the world

100
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,700
the WSIS the Tunis agenda the London

101
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,360
process the IGF the netmundial the Paris

102
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,590
peace process the g20 the talent manual

103
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,080
I saw you know the list is endless it's

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,880
a bit of an alphabet soup so I'll spare

105
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,380
you the rest and but the multiplicity of

106
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,420
processes now trying to forge

107
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,300
international consensus on rules of the

108
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,290
road is enormous I want to say a brief

109
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,570
word about the global Commission on the

110
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,310
stability of cyberspace which I

111
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,640
mentioned earlier the Commission did not

112
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,310
begin its work in a vacuum we build on

113
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,400
the efforts of previous groups

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,590
particularly on the UN group of

115
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,560
governmental experts and particularly

116
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,310
the reports of 2013 and 15 that proposed

117
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,980
11 crucial norms that have been endorsed

118
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,680
by many but they remain II remain to be

119
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,760
endorsed and I've already mentioned the

120
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,860
other organizations we've taken all of

121
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,190
their recommendations and work into

122
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,860
consideration we believe that norms are

123
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,870
foundational for better governance and

124
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,890
therefore the initial focus of our work

125
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,230
they form a test of what needs to be

126
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,530
done a practical sense of what practical

127
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,420
and operational steps need to be

128
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,060
undertaken to achieve some measure of

129
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,590
cyber stability we are guided by

130
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,990
significant shared core beliefs the

131
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,050
members of the Commission and to answer

132
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,760
the point which came up recently that

133
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,490
policymakers and techies don't talk to

134
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,930
each other you'll be happy to

135
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,030
know that we have a truly

136
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,530
multi-stakeholder commission with many

137
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,690
people from the tech world as well as

138
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,410
from the policy world we have come out

139
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,780
with eight norms and marina will tell

140
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,940
you more about that meanwhile they I

141
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,470
want to talk about some current issues

142
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,949
in India that are engaging us there are

143
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,440
serious concerns about fake news and

144
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,680
influence operations on social media in

145
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,210
India this is something that is

146
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,180
occupying the public imagination there

147
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,430
are even more serious concerns on data

148
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,889
privacy and data localization after gdpr

149
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:30,550
came out India has also been considering

150
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,570
its own data protection bill in

151
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,509
Parliament there was a very high-level

152
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,210
committee report and a draft bill which

153
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,090
has been tabled but right now with

154
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,789
elections due in March or April I don't

155
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:47,770
think this bill is going to be passed

156
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,840
where he's very soon at least it doesn't

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,250
appear that way on social media you know

158
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,440
many of you may have heard that the head

159
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,180
of Twitter was summoned before a

160
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,010
parliamentary committee and he didn't

161
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,500
appear but over the years we've had

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,990
dialogue between the government and many

163
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,280
of the social media platforms and one of

164
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
the ways that's being considered which I

165
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,330
personally believe would be a draconian

166
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,169
move is the invocation of article 79 of

167
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,130
India's IT Act to say that the law would

168
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,680
apply to intermediaries which means the

169
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,599
platform's would be responsible for the

170
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
content put out in the and that tech

171
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
platforms need to deploy technical

172
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,979
solutions for to deal with fake news

173
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,669
civil society so I think that one point

174
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,289
is that the Supreme Court of India's

175
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,740
rule that privacy is a fundamental right

176
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,380
but the government of India also has

177
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,240
obligations to preserve national

178
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,910
security so as always it's this balance

179
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,570
and I think that there are those who

180
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,490
would argue

181
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,980
that maybe we shouldn't be talking about

182
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,320
International Cooperation at all that

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,149
that's not the answer that we need

184
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,029
robust national systems and that we need

185
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,399
to protect our own country first before

186
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,920
we talk about International Cooperation

187
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,830
this is a self-defeating view because of

188
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,470
the nature of cyberspace you know you

189
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,420
can argue that it does have borders or

190
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,830
it doesn't have borders but it was

191
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,560
certainly designed to be open free and

192
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,940
inclusive and what we need is a robust

193
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,430
internal national system in each country

194
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,550
and this is what India believes and also

195
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,100
International Cooperation I don't see

196
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,800
any fundamental difference between these

197
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,170
two International Cooperation has been

198
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,220
increasingly recognized as essential and

199
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,529
set to such cooperation exchange of best

200
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,500
practices better M lat procedures for

201
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,890
exchanging information and agreement on

202
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,959
certain basic norms I believe are

203
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,560
important components of such cooperation

204
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,250
India signed several

205
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,520
government-to-government agreements on

206
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,140
cyber security and you know I I myself

207
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,580
initiated many of these dialogues and

208
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm delighted to see them coming to

209
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,529
fruition and I would like to end by

210
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:26,350
reiterating my belief that in the

211
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,300
borderless world of cyberspace our

212
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,820
greatest challenges still lie ahead

213
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,510
whether for India or for the world with

214
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,950
the development of artificial

215
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,630
intelligence the Internet of Things

216
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,760
about which we heard some alarming

217
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
reports and the new disruptive

218
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,779
technology is the need for better

219
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,810
international standards regulatory

220
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,820
practices and cooperation will only

221
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,720
increase we know that technology will

222
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,910
always move faster than the speed at

223
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,399
which regulation and policies can be

224
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,370
implemented but I truly believe that we

225
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,100
need to globally evolve and adopt our

226
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,160
norms and policies to keep a cyber world

227
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,900
safe conflict between states will take

228
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,029
new forms largely due to cyber

229
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,589
capabilities

230
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,940
offensive cyber operations will

231
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,100
undermine the peaceful use of cyberspace

232
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,450
and will limit its effect to boost

233
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,960
economic growth and individual freedom

234
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,570
we are all exploiting cyberspace and few

235
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,920
of us are willing to take responsibility

236
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,740
for it

237
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,140
we need policy coherence related to the

238
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,660
security and stability of cyberspace to

239
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,270
apply equally to state and non-state

240
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:48,710
actors without this this amazing

241
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,710
technology that we all rely on can

242
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,010
become a fearful threat rather than an

243
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,010
enabling promise for our future my final

244
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,330
conclusion is that cyber peace or at

245
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,540
least cyber cooperation will finally be

246
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,779
our best cyber defense thank you all for

247
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,339
your attention in your patient hearing

248
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:13,089
thank you

249
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:26,059
