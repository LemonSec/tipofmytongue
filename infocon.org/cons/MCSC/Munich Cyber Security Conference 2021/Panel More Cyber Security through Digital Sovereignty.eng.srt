00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
sandro is director of the digital

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199

monarch sandra your topic for the fourth

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
panel

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
more cyber security through digital

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,039
sovereignty

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,199
i leave it up to you to introduce your

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,239
guests

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,879
can you move a little bit to the center

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,800
of the camera

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
for the kind introduction so i'm uh very

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
honored and uh pleased of course to be

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,640
here at the munich

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,879
cyber security conference uh despite the

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,720
digital format i would love to be

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,439
with you peter and the gang in munich

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
now in the hotel but

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
we hopefully get that get back there

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,119
next year

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,119
um so i just want to briefly set the

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,439
scene before i introduce my

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,000
excellent panel we're having here so the

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
the topic

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,159
digital sovereignty is actually

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,479
something that came up a while ago

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,960
and that's keeping us busy in particular

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,079
in germany

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,600
from a number of different angles

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
privacy security but

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,360
also more narrowly over the last time

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
the german industries and uh

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
it's beginning to become a topic of

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
greater maturity

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
of greater interests so i think it is

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
important to understand the connection

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,360
that we have between

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
sovereignty and security so how are the

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
two related

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
i was thinking about a citation from

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
winston churchill i like to cite winston

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,719
churchill

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
and he once reportedly said that the

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
only

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
statistics you can trust are the ones

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
you have falsified yourself which is a

61
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,640
common

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
saying in germany and this kind of

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
relates to our topic because it has a

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
similar problem

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
there's a lot of state-driven interest

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
to have hidden trap doors in it

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
for law enforcement for espionage for

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,360
sabotage in some cases and the

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
complexity of i.t

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
unfortunately is so huge and the back

71
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
doors kill switches

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
and intentional little errors are so

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
tiny and can look so innocent

74
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,760
that it's technically and operationally

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
impossible to validate the system if you

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
have not built it yourself

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,599
so maybe a cyber winston churchill would

78
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,360
have said the only i.t you can trust

79
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
is the one you have falsified yourself

80
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
otherwise you will never know what's in

81
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,040
there

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
and there's a big difference um if

83
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
you're putting something in an i.t

84
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
because you own it

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
in comparison to the certainly still

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,000
dozens to

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,519
hundreds of vulnerabilities which are

88
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
inside these systems anyway so

89
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
you could say um that any state can hack

90
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
any machine at any moment and plan

91
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
something in there which is certainly

92
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,360
true

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
but having your very own architecture

94
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
your own backdoor kill switches

95
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,120
is very different from that so this axis

96
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
first of all is legally required so even

97
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
if you discover it

98
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,159
and remove it it will come back in the

99
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
next iteration of the technology

100
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,120
one way or another and these kind of

101
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,959
accesses are architecturally

102
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,720
manufactured and built into these

103
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
systems so they enable very high

104
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
privileges full access they're invisible

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,319
to security mechanisms

106
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,000
they cannot be removed they can switch

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,159
off all systems of that brand

108
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
and that's a lot of potential power

109
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,440
inside these systems

110
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,640
of the state who kind of owns the

111
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
technology

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
one way or another so um

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
in a way and this is one concern that

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
we're certainly having in many of the

115
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
german industries but also in the german

116
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
government for many technologies that

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
we're looking at

118
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,120
you could become a de facto hostage of

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
the political will of the actor behind

120
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,439
it

121
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,319
be that in china that you're hostage to

122
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,959
a totalitarian dictatorship or be that

123
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
that there may be backdoors in there for

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
law enforcement from other entities from

125
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,439
more friendly nations one way or another

126
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,720
there's something in there that you

127
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
cannot control and this of course is not

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,879
critical in all cases i mean consumer

129
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,920
electronics

130
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
may be the thing that we worry about

131
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
most are mobile phones in

132
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,040
day-to-day life but actually a lot of

133
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
other technologies may be way more

134
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
critical so critical national

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
infrastructures for example military

136
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,880
technology

137
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
economically critical communication

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
technologies are very different

139
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,320
because there is clearly desirable to

140
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
not have the possibility of foreign

141
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,040
access

142
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
and to have innovative sovereignty over

143
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
the baseline technologies as well

144
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
because you will be building on top of

145
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
these technologies entire ecosystems

146
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
of your own digital making and then when

147
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
you're dependent

148
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
also in terms of innovation on someone

149
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
else then you're also not just having so

150
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
not sovereignty

151
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
in security you're also not sovereign in

152
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
innovation

153
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
so at this point um sovereignty actually

154
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
matters so

155
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
uh the question is how can i uh assess

156
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,520
that and manufacturers of course will

157
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
lie to you about the trustworthiness

158
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,919
so the main element by which to assess

159
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
them is their sovereign affiliation and

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
the nation's interests in backdoors kill

161
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
switches and the like and at this point

162
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
unfortunately

163
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
especially the big it countries have a

164
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
substantial interest

165
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
in offensive cyber so china we know is

166
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
very big on network technology

167
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
but still number one internationally in

168
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
industrial espionage and very big and

169
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
strategic espionage as well and on top

170
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
of that a totalitarian country

171
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,479
and the five eyes certainly friends and

172
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,600
acting in our interest

173
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
but they're still having as one still

174
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
being the biggest software producers and

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,919
they're still having a strong interest

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,840
and legal requirements for backdoors and

177
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
their technologies as well

178
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
and we have other actors which are not

179
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,000
on the agendas and i frequently like to

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,400
call

181
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
on uh the uae and the ksa so saudi

182
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,320
arabia

183
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,280
and and the whole region because what

184
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,199
happens currently in saudi arabia with

185
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,479
mbs in particular

186
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,600
is the the commercial construction

187
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
of a major cyber power so they're

188
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
getting very very effective in offensive

189
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,160
cyber

190
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,960
may even be among the top three already

191
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
very unnoticed because it's a largely

192
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
industrial effort not so much

193
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
in the nation state and they are already

194
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,039
in control of much of the hardware

195
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,479
production globally

196
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
so this is something that has not been

197
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
researched so very well but they may

198
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
very soon develop their own offensive

199
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
interests in backdoors and

200
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
weakening technologies in specific cases

201
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
and of course we also have some concrete

202
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
discussions and cases the biggest one of

203
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,160
course is

204
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
huawei and 5g that's a discussion that

205
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,520
is

206
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,240
very very widely going on in germany

207
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,720
with

208
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
very different opinions and a lot of

209
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
opinions because five

210
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
huawei of course is cheap it's

211
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,000
technologically also very advanced

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,960
and we need a good 5g network but our

213
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
economy will depend on the goodwill of

214
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
china for a long time

215
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
and we are supporting a dictatorship in

216
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
a very critical

217
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
technology and in a very critical phase

218
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
of its innovation

219
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,759
and but there are also smaller cases on

220
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,680
a day-to-day basis so one

221
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
other example for example is the german

222
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
automotive sector right now who's

223
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,680
looking for

224
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
operating systems and is now eyeing qnx

225
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
as an operating system for german cars

226
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
which is a canadian operating system

227
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
uh part of the five eyes may have hidden

228
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
access somewhere

229
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
and while we would not expect that the

230
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
five eyes will abuse that

231
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,240
in our disadvantage it may be that this

232
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
secret is kind of leaked somewhere this

233
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
has happened in the past repeatedly and

234
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,039
then

235
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
criminals may have this kind of access

236
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
we may have lost it

237
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
and it will be it could be a critical

238
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
problem

239
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
for the german cars so it would be nice

240
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,160
to have

241
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
trusted trustworthy european sovereign

242
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,840
technologies

243
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
for these cases and not just

244
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
technologies also

245
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,280
a more open and active culture for

246
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,599
innovation also better capabilities in

247
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,360
critical security functions

248
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
and we would certainly have the outset

249
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
for that as well we know that we have

250
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
great engineers we have big tech

251
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,879
companies

252
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
many of which are now building i.t

253
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
systems ironically

254
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,039
a lot of these very innovative entities

255
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,160
in the united states

256
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
are trying to of the big software

257
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,599
companies are very much trying to

258
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
hire europeans into their services

259
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,800
because we have

260
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
uh very good engineers very good

261
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
education so we could do all these

262
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
things ourselves

263
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
but we're just not really doing them so

264
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
the question is do we really want that

265
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
where would where do we want that and

266
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,519
how do we get there

267
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
and so this is a bit the backdrop

268
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,320
background of what we will discuss today

269
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
we will ask ourselves why and where do

270
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
we need digital sovereignty

271
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,679
which technologies do we actually

272
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,399
require uh who could be a trusted

273
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
european supplier of those technologies

274
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
how can we build them

275
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,240
and who needs to create which kinds of

276
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
incentives

277
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
and i'm now very much looking forward to

278
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,800
my fabulous panel

279
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
to discuss this with i will not

280
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,160
introduce them

281
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
because i always prefer if panelists

282
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
introduce themselves quickly

283
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
and i will start the round of

284
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
introductions by asking

285
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
first of all for your introduction of

286
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,839
yourself

287
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
and then by asking also for a little

288
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
definition of digital sovereignty

289
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,839
and we will start with robert please

290
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
thank you very much thank you very much

291
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
for invitation and um

292
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
very good introduction by you sandra my

293
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
name is robert kosla

294
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
i'm director of department of cyber

295
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
security in the council

296
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
of the prime minister in poland of

297
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
course our responsibility

298
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
is to take care about about our

299
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,680
investment in

300
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
a modern digital economy so of course

301
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,240
not not forget about about

302
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
cyber security aspects so the topic

303
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
today topic

304
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
about digital sovereignty we have a lot

305
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
of discussions uh

306
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,800
starting with where we participate

307
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
actively as a member state

308
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
starting with federated cloud

309
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
environments the new

310
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
new secure and digital digitally

311
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
sovereign

312
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
uh federated european uh cloud

313
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
supporting

314
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,440
development of modern modern economy of

315
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
course

316
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
take into consideration different

317
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
scenarios representing different

318
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
industries they the this is the area

319
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
where we are going

320
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,480
also to invest from ipsi mechanism

321
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
what's more of course this is a question

322
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
of um

323
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
development the level of development uh

324
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,600
from

325
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,640
european perspective uh

326
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
i'm responsible and my department is

327
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
responsible for

328
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
recovery and resiliency plan in poland

329
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,720
in the for the cyber security component

330
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
of course our focus

331
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,079
is on development of trusted

332
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,040
cloud services based on the recent

333
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
investment of the polish government

334
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,079
to have more resilient cloud

335
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
services available for citizens and also

336
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,320
companies

337
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,720
you ask about about definition of

338
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,760
of sovereignty and i think uh we can

339
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,000
look

340
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
at this definition and at least from my

341
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
perspective i'm looking this as a

342
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,880
uh something like a controlling

343
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,160
influence

344
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,680
so sovereign digital and sovereignty

345
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
from my perspective is a question of

346
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
governance it's a question of impact

347
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
it's and the way how we can we can

348
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,920
influence the digital market especially

349
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,079
in europe digital single market

350
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,880
through facilitation directions and of

351
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,160
course financing

352
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,120
the major activities uh to develop this

353
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
market so i think that's that would be

354
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,760

359
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,399

please introduce yourself and give us

364
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,800
your

365
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
definition of digital sovereignty

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,079
thanks a lot sandra thank you for having

367
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,279
me

368
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
my name is vanessa i'm the founder and

369
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,320
ceo of

370
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,399
fragmentex storage solutions here in

371
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
austria

372
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
uh actually as sandro already mentioned

373
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
i'm kind of fanatic about

374
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,720
digital serenity which has been

375
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
made me have these these kind of caps

376
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
from my marketing department

377
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,360
uh no actually

378
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
of course it is a question of yeah let's

379
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,480
say

380
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
paradigms we somehow have to synchronize

381
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,200
our semantic understanding of the term

382
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
of digital serenity

383
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
uh of course i agree with just about

384
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,839
everything that robert

385
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,040
mentioned before and our focus of course

386
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,600
is

387
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,560
not only to stay in let's say the

388
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,040
political sphere of a definition

389
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,079
actually our goal our approach is uh way

390
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,959
stronger to

391
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
make it possible for the individual for

392
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
the small medium enterprise for the

393
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
larger enterprise and even of course

394
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,880
also

395
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,639
for governments uh to have a chance a

396
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,440
technology-driven chance

397
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
to achieve digital serenity by

398
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
themselves and to retain it

399
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
so in my understanding and that's maybe

400
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,680
the reason why i'm not a politician

401
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
i prefer to trust on maths and on

402
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,079
science and not so much on rules

403
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,240
and so for us digital serenity is

404
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
actually something that is

405
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,680
uh of course not only by technology but

406
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,639
in our point of view mainly achievable

407
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,680
by having

408
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
technology solutions to enable the

409
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,360
individual

410
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,639
and the sme actually the citizen

411
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,720
and all the larger constructs of human

412
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,680
people to achieve this kind of serenity

413
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
thank you vanna and i will now hand it

414
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
over to cyril who is

415
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,519
a representative of a large european

416
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
company

417
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,720
hello i'm in charge of digital security

418
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,839
nato's

419
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,560
digital security covers the cyber

420
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,680
security part of it and the

421
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
national security as we see a lot of

422
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
convergence and

423
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
the convergence of cyber and national

424
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,079
securities is valid not only for

425
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
sovereign topic i will not challenge the

426
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
definition of sovereign what i would say

427
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,120
is for a larger i.t

428
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,079
company like katos sovereignty digital

429
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
sovereignty is kind of schizophrenic

430
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,320
because in one way our customers

431
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,320
are asking for for the control of

432
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,800
what they are of their data of their

433
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
information of their

434
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
processes of everything so they're

435
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,600
asking for sovereignty

436
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
but on the other end they want to get

437
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
the service the optimal service they

438
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
want to get something that is useful for

439
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,880
them being

440
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,320
in digital overall or in cyber security

441
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,120
and of course the first role of cyber

442
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
security is to is to protect

443
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
so they would like both to be protected

444
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
but to be protected at a level that

445
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
allow them to be in control and not to

446
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
be dependent on other third party

447
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,639
so sometimes as a as a supplier

448
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,040
we have to manage this schizophrenic

449
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,480
view on the

450
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,199
is it is the is the is the medicine

451
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,079
worse

452
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,399
than the the the the disease

453
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,240
and we have to really deal with that to

454
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,759
you know handling with our customers

455
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,399
thank you sir um so now finally i'd like

456
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,600
to hand it over to

457
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
uh sergey who is joining us from palo

458
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
alto networks

459
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
thanks sandra and thanks for having me

460
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
back at this conference

461
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,639
so my name is segep i'm the chief

462
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
security officer for central river palo

463
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
alto networks

464
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
for the last two years and previously i

465
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
used to

466
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
to run cyber defense and one large tax

467
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
certi company

468
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
and i guess you know if you ask me on

469
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,279
the definition on on digital sovereignty

470
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,600
i would say most people agree that um

471
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,279
you know in any global economy and

472
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,959
hyper-connected road

473
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
free and secure flow of data is very

474
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,639
important in order to stay

475
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,639
competitive right so the answer cannot

476
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,720
be that we build everything

477
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
ourselves i mean i'm not aware of any

478
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
big product in any country where

479
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
everything is done just by by this

480
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,519
specific uh

481
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
nation and i think looking also um you

482
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
know the most promising digital natives

483
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,639
here in germany um like salando's

484
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,920
delivery heroes

485
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
volocopters of this road i think they're

486
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,600
all as well interconnected

487
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
um with the digital system right so i

488
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:36,720
guess every

489
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,959
every organization has to understand

490
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
what is the the true value add in the

491
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
system and how to

492
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
um you know how to create this value add

493
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,399
and not to reinvent the entire wheel

494
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,920
um and i would say um mr shinga

495
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,240
he put the right challenge in his

496
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,839
keynote on the table

497
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,680
really to you know asking us how we

498
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
create trust in this system

499
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
and what is really trusted and what not

500
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,560
and

501
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
also i like the definition of influence

502
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,799
trustfulness where certainly

503
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,559
a lot of perspectives can be given like

504
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,079
reliability security privacy

505
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,919
self-determination but i guess in the

506
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,280
end

507
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,720
you know this this cloud tech where

508
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,199
the data is not necessary anymore bound

509
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,160
to location

510
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
is something where we all have to learn

511
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,480
how to protect those data the consumers

512
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,359
and as well the

513
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
the vendors so let me try to reflect

514
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
what we hear from our customers

515
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
um you know who are in particular very

516
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,240
sensitive about digital sovereignty

517
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,120
and um those customers uh seeking first

518
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,280
of all for more transparency right

519
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
so we've tried to respond to that um

520
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
for example and provide really um

521
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
insight on how we are how we're driving

522
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
our

523
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
supply chain how we're manufacturing

524
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
chips where they manufactured uh how

525
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
they sealed how they are

526
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
really delivered uh to the customers how

527
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,440
we check the integrity afterwards

528
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
insights on our internal security um

529
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
insights and the the right really to

530
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,000
handle the data

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,679
uh whether the data is stored in europe

532
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
or in the u.s

533
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,200
um so i think these are the first

534
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,120
aspects which are being um

535
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
being asked and my definition of digital

536
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
serenity would be

537
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,919
in context of cyber security

538
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
specifically that um

539
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,760
you have to have the capabilities to

540
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
validate the trustfulness

541
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
and trustfulness of the organization but

542
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,039
also the technology

543
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,480
right and all these transparency

544
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
initiatives i've just mentioned

545
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,919
but also others like technical

546
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,280
validations um

547
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,440
or even certifications there are a lot

548
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,960
of great initiatives

549
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
like c5 nce or stock 2.0 where you can

550
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,919
ask large vendors to provide insights

551
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,640
over

552
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
hundreds of reports of pages actually in

553
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,919
reports

554
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,480
to describe how security is being you

555
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
know managed

556
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,679
across those companies another

557
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,520
example from uh from the automotive

558
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,280
sector is for instance

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,480
that um you know they they've created or

560
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,679
come up with a with a separate

561
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,200
certification as well

562
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
uh which is called t sucks um which

563
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,240
they've

564
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
trying now to adopt or forces large

565
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
manufacturers across the entire supply

566
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
chain so i think

567
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
from their point of view it's also part

568
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,000
of the digital severity to ensure that

569
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,640
all the

570
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,679
suppliers are being properly secured so

571
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,360
that's one view and i think a second

572
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,160
view

573
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
is uh what we hear very often is that

574
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,240
digital sovereignty is also something

575
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,559
about uh trust into the technology

576
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,840
i think we had to read the discussion

577
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,679
last year on the panel here while we can

578
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,600
trust an organization i think technology

579
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,000
remains

580
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
far too complex to be trusted simply

581
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,679
because we are all interconnected and

582
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,919
there could be a lot of systematic risks

583
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,160
which we don't understand um solarwinds

584
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
supply chain

585
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
attacks we've seen in the past are just

586
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
one small you know

587
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
aspect of this of this iceberg so i

588
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,640
guess

589
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
it shows us that even the most advanced

590
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
companies out there can be compromised

591
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
and therefore um we in cyber security

592
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,320
always

593
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,080
you know referring back to the uh to a

594
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
strategy of zero trust architecture so

595
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
really trying to reduce the trust as

596
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
much as possible and always

597
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
verify this technology and specifically

598
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,760
our customers

599
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,039
you know who are using insecure

600
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,640
technology having a lot of technical

601
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,280
adapt

602
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
which they cannot change they're seeking

603
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
for compensating measures to you know

604
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
have a permanent layer of verification

605
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,600
of such

606
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
technologies or even understanding how

607
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
they can decouple that

608
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
uh from the system by you know controls

609
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
like segmentation and so on

610
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
so in simple words if you if you can't

611
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,880
trust the technology

612
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,799
and you you don't really want to change

613
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,640
it or you can't change it i think you

614
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
can create always successful

615
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
compensating measure

616
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,799
for that for that part

617
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,200
thank you segi and i thank you very

618
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
nicely uh turning back to the uh

619
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,799
overall topic of the conference which

620
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,720
vulcan is already mentioned yesterday

621
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
namely trust so trust

622
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
uh as he said is the most important

623
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
ingredient in diplomacy

624
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,919
uh also because you cannot really verify

625
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,240
what's in the mind of your

626
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
other nation's counterpart and but i

627
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
think in it as you already mentioned we

628
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,320
also have this concept of zero trust or

629
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,360
trustworthy

630
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
so trustworthy that's also an

631
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
interesting philosophical distinctions

632
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
by the way trust is something that i

633
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,360
deliver in advance and

634
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
as i believe in something trustworthy on

635
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
the other hand is something that i can

636
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
actually verify and validate so

637
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,440
if somebody or system is trustworthy i

638
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,039
can actually verify

639
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,200
uh its particular characteristics which

640
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
are relevant for that

641
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,799
so i think the question for us is since

642
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,320
our trust has been

643
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
uh shaken every now and then in europe

644
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,679
in in some of these systems and in their

645
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,440
reliability functionality

646
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
and some of the security aspects um

647
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
are there any areas where we actually

648
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,760
need trustworthy technologies rather

649
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
than trust into a vendor

650
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
and is that something that we can

651
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:52,880
generate

652
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,000
by rules uh by setting up a law or is a

653
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
law not sufficient and do we have to

654
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,559
actually

655
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,799
regain control of the architecture of

656
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,640
the technological development process

657
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
itself so this is something i would like

658
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
to discuss with you now and i think i

659
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,320
would first like to ask

660
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,840
cyril to ask what large company like

661
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,559
atos

662
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
would where where would you consider

663
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,799
parts where rules are sufficient where

664
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,640
trust is sufficient which level of trust

665
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
whereas trustworthy required

666
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,480
was the hardest position yeah i think

667
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
from a sergey told us it's quite clear

668
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,559
we have to differentiate some technology

669
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,400
and some level of

670
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
let's say of technology that needs to be

671
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,080
sovereign that needs to be trusted

672
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,440
but you can't rely uh on the summer

673
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
product to be uh to be a fully uh let's

674
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,640
say a secure trusted

675
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,280
so you need to uh to really look at the

676
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,919
overall

677
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,120
uh environment not coming from the

678
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
let's say the hardware software system

679
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,400
to uh

680
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,679
to have the full view so what we believe

681
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,440
is that you need to um

682
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
to s to to secure or to

683
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
highlight a certain number of technology

684
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,919
around cryptography around the

685
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,360
digital identity let's say artificial

686
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
intelligence which is a big word but

687
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,880
we need also to have to have some trust

688
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,159
on it

689
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,640
i'm talking also about quantum well the

690
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,559
future-proof technology that will be at

691
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,679
the base of

692
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
let's say a quantum proof technology

693
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,039
let's say

694
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,159
deciphering of non-quantum proof

695
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,679
technology and the use for

696
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
for advanced cryptography so we need to

697
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,360
have these basis

698
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
capacity to be able to be offered to

699
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,600
uh to our let's say not only our

700
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
government because government is only a

701
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,320
one

702
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,919
one layer uh of course the fundamental

703
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,799
and the most uh

704
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,880
let's say trustful leader i know you

705
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,200
know in our world

706
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
you know at least you know in our

707
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,320
western world

708
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
still but also for

709
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,279
any company i think we are we are

710
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
sometimes let's say a mix

711
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,279
but sometimes separating the need for

712
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,400
for

713
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,120
let's say a government and critical site

714
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
from the need of a corporate

715
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,440
but more and more these two worlds are

716
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,760
our merging are converging

717
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,240
and we really need to because when you

718
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,799
are

719
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,840
you are talking about the car

720
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
manufacturer okay

721
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,960
cars can can become weapons so it's not

722
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,760
anymore

723
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,440
you know you can use them you can you

724
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,200
can take control of them and and

725
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
and have them become weapon if you are

726
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
let's say uh in

727
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,720
agriculture and uh and using a phosphate

728
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,279
nitrate you can you can use it as a bomb

729
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
and you can let's say put it in the

730
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,679
middle of a

731
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,679
have it in the middle of a city and make

732
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,960
it at the moment so

733
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,320
no more let's say no more separation

734
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,919
between these two universe

735
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
so meaning we need this basic technology

736
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,120
then we

737
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,760
trusted not trusted technology we need

738
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,039
trusted

739
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,840
companies trusted layers or our

740
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,559
customers

741
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,919
asking us to have a trustees people that

742
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,279
are able to to build interface between

743
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,960
this uh let's say this first layer of

744
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,720
technology which is which are the the

745
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,159
key one that we can really

746
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
rely on that can be audited by

747
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,520
the various let's say a security bodies

748
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,559
or or

749
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,760
of our of our countries

750
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,120
then distrusted the capacity

751
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,600
to interfere this technology with deer

752
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
let's say the open world

753
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,559
when i saw open wall why wouldn't we use

754
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,200
the best of breed of the security

755
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
of of some some let's say

756
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,520
friends some friends in the u.s some

757
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,400
friends in

758
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
another country why wouldn't we use this

759
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,679
technology

760
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,440
why wouldn't you the capacity of the

761
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,880
hyperscaler

762
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,400
to to deliver a fantastic

763
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,440
let's say cloud capacity and and then

764
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,279
transform the world we are living in in

765
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,000
digital

766
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
we should do this technology but still

767
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,679
we need to control

768
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
this basic layer and we need to have a

769
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
trusted provider

770
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
in all the in all european providers

771
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,240
we're in europe but german

772
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
german and germany that are french in

773
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,679
france that are

774
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
let's say dutch in netherlands we need

775
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,279
to have this

776
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,320
uh capacity to have this uh trusted

777
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,120
parties that can make the the gateway

778
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,039
between these uh key technologies that

779
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,440
we need to control and develop and

780
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,000
and finance and uh and uh and get to the

781
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,640
the and

782
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
our hands hands-on and the let's say

783
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,000
more

784
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,799
global players of this security world

785
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,039
thank you so robert from your

786
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,840
perspective

787
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,880
as a government

788
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,440
regulator what's where would you like to

789
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,000
have

790
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
uh your own technology so more more

791
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,880
control over what you're actually doing

792
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,080
and where do you think rules are

793
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,000
sufficient and how do you

794
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,480
validate intent to validate the rules

795
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,799
yes of course we definitely we need we

796
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,080
need the laws we need

797
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
rules and we need standards because we

798
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,919
need to set the stage for our

799
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,960
collaboration

800
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,279
with academia and industry of course in

801
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,039
this triangle this is the only way how

802
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,240
we can

803
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
develop the trust already mentioned by

804
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,919
by my

805
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,520
uh our colleagues from the from this

806
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,880
panel uh trusts uh can be declared

807
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,919
but of course need to be can be declared

808
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,320
but

809
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,559
declaration is not valid as soon as it's

810
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,919
not proven by the

811
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,480
by the real steps by the real activities

812
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,399
so that's why of course from one side we

813
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,039
have a

814
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,240
loss regarding of course

815
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,679
respect to uh to investment

816
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,880
respect to the rights uh legal rights

817
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,039
and also privacy and of course

818
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,520
and uh the country a country rights to

819
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,799
to be sovereign

820
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,760
the european union to to to take a role

821
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,720
as well

822
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,399
and on the other side we have the rules

823
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,000
where we set the stage for

824
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,960
for industry how to operate how to

825
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,440
develop products how to deliver them

826
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
how to implement them securely at the

827
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,360
end of the day of course we have to have

828
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,039
best practices that needs to be followed

829
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,399
with but need to be developed and

830
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
usually best practices are

831
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,000
should be developed together with

832
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
industry uh

833
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,399
governments are not

834
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,200
devices and services developers so

835
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,399
that's why of course we need this

836
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,399
partnership on the other side

837
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,880
the way how we can check this trust and

838
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
how we

839
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,240
can improve this trust and really prove

840
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,120
the trust

841
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,760
and trustworthiness it's uh starting

842
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,200
from the softest

843
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
ways it's a testing testing testing

844
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
testing of course

845
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,120
we need to check whether the product

846
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,399
services

847
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,799
complies with technical specifications

848
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,080
and standards

849
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
a second is a more formal evaluation and

850
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,360
finally of course certification

851
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
but this is this is ideal words and then

852
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,039
we know that we are not believing the

853
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,679
ideal word that's why of course uh

854
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,000
in the european european union we we set

855
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,960
the stage for

856
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,080
a cyber security act that define

857
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,880
requirements for uh evaluation and

858
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
certification of

859
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
cyber of the product itself on the other

860
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
side when we look at the market

861
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,679
um from the perspective of

862
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,559
how many products are already certified

863
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,880
which are the eligible criteria actually

864
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
for evaluation certification

865
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
and we we found a lot of gaps um just as

866
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
as you refer to 5g

867
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
as you refer to them the next generation

868
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
of technologies and also serial touch

869
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,600
then

870
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,679
some some emerging technologies that

871
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,880
will be implemented

872
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,039
the basic question is how to prove that

873
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,480
both technologies are

874
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,399
resilient that those technologies can be

875
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,720
trusted but those technologies cannot be

876
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,679
misused

877
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
because on one side we are talking about

878
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
rules but the bad guys

879
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,200
do not respect the rules so of course

880
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,279
the rules are for governments the rules

881
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
are for industry the rules of academia

882
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,159
the rules are for

883
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,279
citizens but not not for the bad guys

884
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,320
and politically

885
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,480
or economically motivated gangsters

886
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,520
so that's why of course um we should and

887
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,679
what was already also touched by sergey

888
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,200
about zero trust

889
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,240
and uh it's it's it's zero trust is more

890
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,679
about philosophy

891
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,559
that we should assume not to trust in

892
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,279
any

893
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,880
in in 100 of um security solutions

894
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,080
that's why of course we need to talk

895
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,440
about multi-level

896
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,000
uh security and when i refer to the

897
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,039
definition of

898
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,440
sovereign sovereignty i talked about

899
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,320
impact

900
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,799
i talked about uh controlling influence

901
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,240
so that's why this type of

902
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,559
controlling influence can be said only

903
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,480
in the direct partnership between

904
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,039
between government and not declarative

905
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
partnership because we've had

906
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,039
for at least last 10 years we heard a

907
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,960
lot a lot about

908
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,000
public private partnership but uh the

909
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,640
examples of the uh this successful

910
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,480
public private partnership

911
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
where government of course respect and

912
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
the rights and interests of

913
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,120
companies to to develop and to to gain

914
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,320
profits from their

915
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,440
activities and the industry respect the

916
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,399
government's

917
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,720
uh the right of the government to

918
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
regulate to control because of

919
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
responsibility of governments in front

920
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
of their citizens

921
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,640
so the way uh how i would address the

922
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,360
topic of

923
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,399
trust and building the trust i i can

924
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,960
provide you example from poland because

925
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,120
in 2019

926
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,760
when we started to implement the needs

927
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,559
directive

928
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,840
in our law national law called law on

929
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,279
national cyber security system system

930
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,399
we consider system as ecosystem of

931
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,399
government industry organizations and

932
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,399
citizens involvement as well

933
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
so we we we found that the need to

934
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,640
develop this type of partnership with

935
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,519
industry

936
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,480
and we set the stage for this type of

937
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
effective partnership

938
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
with cyber security cooperation program

939
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,960
this program was announced in october

940
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,279
2019 until now we have

941
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,799
we have almost 20 20 companies and

942
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,039
enrolled into this program pro companies

943
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,440
and organizations also ngos

944
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
and we collaboratively work first of all

945
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,039
to introduce

946
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
the most recent and the most

947
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,039
the most resilient solutions

948
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,519
the most resilient services we also

949
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,240
incorporate

950
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,880
education for users and security

951
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,840
baselines the

952
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,679
provided by by by a company so

953
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,080
i think this is we cannot as i said we

954
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
cannot declare the trust without

955
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,880
the the real steps and real steps

956
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,440
require

957
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,840
some at least the minimum level of of

958
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,960
the rules

959
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
and then good will and facilitation for

960
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,640
them

961
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,000
for them uh for for the effects so

962
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,679
that's what i wanted actually to

963
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,480
to address this in this part thank you

964
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,519
yes thank you

965
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,799
yeah real steps is a good uh a good

966
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,919
step forward i believe and i i can

967
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,679
shift this over to vana because i know

968
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,480
for him uh real steps would be

969
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,320
mainly technology so and i think an

970
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,919
interesting question is

971
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,919
why haven't we built more baseline

972
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,399
technologies in europe in germany why

973
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,080
are we not stronger on some of the

974
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,000
technological parts when we have such

975
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,799
a great base of engineers a great base

976
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,880
of industrial tech companies

977
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
and what would so what's wrong in the

978
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,799
market so to speak and which incentives

979
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,399
do we need or how do we have to

980
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,080
re shape the market to create incentives

981
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,919
for more sovereignty on the technical

982
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,159
level

983
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,240
yeah thanks for for this question uh

984
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,120
sandra

985
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,720
actually i think uh the the perspectives

986
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,679
of an of a european uh high-tech company

987
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,080
in

988
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
in our case a rather young startup

989
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,760
company even so i'm

990
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,240
in this industry since uh nearly 30

991
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,519
years now

992
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,960
of course it is not easy always to

993
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,919
find out who has a real interest in this

994
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,880
game

995
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,639
when we talk about cyber security it's

996
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,879
it's actually uh also of course a

997
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,599
a way or a one of the aspects of

998
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,359
astronautic hybrid warfare

999
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,639
uh and it's maybe not in the

1000
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,320
consciousness of the broader public but

1001
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,879
actually we are all affected by that

1002
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,079
and of course uh there are several

1003
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,639
levels

1004
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,879
uh to this problem and so uh maybe to

1005
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,239
start with the

1006
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,239
most obvious uh one uh these this

1007
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,359
friendfo recognition to find out who is

1008
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,639
your real partner

1009
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,399
uh does it change over time and

1010
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,918
especially when we talk about

1011
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,000
uh political changes in in all the

1012
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,760
countries and all the blocks we've

1013
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,800
mentioned today

1014
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,199
uh it's getting somehow tricky and uh

1015
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,719
maybe maybe one way to

1016
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,599
to better understand this is somehow the

1017
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,440
uh let's say historical view

1018
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,320
and when we go back some 20 years uh i

1019
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
just remember the former

1020
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,680
cia director james woolsey uh

1021
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,520
very bluntly and directly uh told to

1022
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,920
i think it was the uh wall street

1023
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,839
journal and and then later on it was

1024
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,320
uh reprinted here hp and some other

1025
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,680
newspapers decide

1026
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
uh why we are spying on you because you

1027
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:16,960
are

1028
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
actually uh yeah you you are bribing and

1029
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,040
and so

1030
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
actually european technology is not

1031
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,040
really worth uh spying on it because you

1032
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,800
don't you are not advanced enough

1033
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,880
so somehow uh at that point this was

1034
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
very blunt some 20 years ago

1035
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
but of course i think we still have to

1036
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,880
uh be very clear here that

1037
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,960
uh being the newest kid in town the

1038
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,000
the new block the eu actually we need to

1039
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,880
have some

1040
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,760
more maybe a little bit more solid spine

1041
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,720
on that

1042
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
and so uh i also i'm fully aware that

1043
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,480
it makes a big difference if you are

1044
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
living and working in a small neutral

1045
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,560
country like like here in austria

1046
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,680
or if you live in a larger maybe more uh

1047
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,320
fully integrated nato member country and

1048
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,119
so on

1049
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,599
and so i'm pretty convinced that it's

1050
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,480
not only

1051
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,359
the set of skills uh that makes a

1052
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,040
difference in who can

1053
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,000
really produce develop and produce

1054
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,599
baseline technology

1055
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,920
it's also of course a question of the

1056
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,640
let's say

1057
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,400
economic and political will to do it

1058
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,520
and one aspect of this game which is uh

1059
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,240
actually

1060
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,480
uh very frustrating uh not so much

1061
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
for for for us here at the moment but

1062
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,240
but to to see this in the

1063
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,000
last uh 10 to 15 years a lot of very

1064
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
interesting technologies were developed

1065
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,599
a lot of very interesting

1066
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,359
organizations actually have been founded

1067
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,320
and when it came to market readiness

1068
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,480
when it came to the situation where

1069
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
other countries other blocks

1070
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,800
would definitely uh do public

1071
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,560
procurement of this technology and

1072
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,520
support these

1073
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,720
baseline sovereignty uh technologies

1074
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,760
uh actually the europeans used to step

1075
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
on their own toes

1076
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,200
have a lot of regulations uh of course

1077
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,040
it's tax payer money of course there

1078
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
needs to be a

1079
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
whole set of rules to to avoid

1080
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,040
corruption but nevertheless uh

1081
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,480
if you have too many rules or rules that

1082
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,280
actually

1083
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
stop you by developing or to develop

1084
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,560
things like that

1085
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,760
it's getting actually very tricky and uh

1086
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,480
just let me uh answer two to the the

1087
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
former question also

1088
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
uh when it comes to the comparison

1089
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,440
between trusting

1090
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,560
in rules and regulations and laws uh i

1091
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,839
fully agree with robert

1092
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,680
that of course these regulations are

1093
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,960
necessary

1094
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,920
i just want to stress the point that it

1095
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,800
is not enough

1096
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
it definitely is not enough you have to

1097
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,079
mitigate

1098
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,200
these challenges by adopting

1099
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,200
technology adopting science physics math

1100
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,839
in a way that enables you to have all

1101
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:58,800
the layers

1102
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
of of protection to to have a chance to

1103
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,400
achieve serenity

1104
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,440
and so for instance uh just just the

1105
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,720
uh historic example uh adi shamir

1106
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,240
uh 42 years ago at mit uh published his

1107
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,320
first paper on on secret sharing which

1108
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,119
is actually

1109
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,599
an old mathematical algorithm in the

1110
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,560
meantime

1111
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,920
but nevertheless it it helps us protect

1112
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,640
against

1113
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,400
future quantum computers and so actually

1114
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
i think it's not so much only a question

1115
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
of

1116
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,320
economic situation or political

1117
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
situation it's also a question of

1118
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,880
are we really interested as a society to

1119
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
achieve digital serenity

1120
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
and who probably uh wants to have it who

1121
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,000
is responsible to have it and who

1122
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,599
maybe pretends but isn't really

1123
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,520
interested in it and so i think this is

1124
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,200
a very tricky situation

1125
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,240
uh and of course yeah when we just uh

1126
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,920
think about things like the u.s cloud

1127
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,680
act of 2018

1128
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,800
uh there is a lot of yeah i don't want

1129
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,520
to say this

1130
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
bad word but there's a lot of strange

1131
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,800
arguments out there

1132
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
uh and and if you really read the text

1133
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,400
and understand the meaning

1134
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
uh you should think about that we have

1135
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
to think about if we really

1136
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
want to achieve digital serenity or we

1137
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
if we should stop pretending it

1138
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,000
yeah thanks jenna um okay so i have a

1139
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,960
question from

1140
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,599
the uh from the audience which relates

1141
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,000
to

1142
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,839
uh what you said because of course we

1143
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
know that that especially in europe one

1144
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,880
one larger problem is

1145
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,960
governments and regulations so it's

1146
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
frequently seen to be a roadblock

1147
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,320
for innovation and something that rather

1148
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
complicates things than enabling them

1149
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
and this fits nicely to the question

1150
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,680
that we're having from the audience

1151
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,440
namely how can governments and companies

1152
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,400
work together

1153
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,560
to secure stability and reliability even

1154
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,400
to fight those gangsters as robert just

1155
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,079
said and i'd like to ask that question

1156
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,680
to sergey especially

1157
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,680
uh with a look to the united states are

1158
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,520
there maybe lessons that we can learn

1159
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,720
from the united states

1160
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
over here in europe regarding the

1161
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
cooperation of private

1162
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,359
and public or are you guys just as bad

1163
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
as we are

1164
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,319
yeah i think you know there's definitely

1165
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,079
lessons to learn everywhere um

1166
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,359
and specifically um you know in in the

1167
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,160
in the sector

1168
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
of uh ppps public-private partnerships i

1169
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,599
think the

1170
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,680
the u.s um as you asked a specific

1171
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,160
example invested very early on

1172
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,520
um by creating certain sharing alliances

1173
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,599
right all the all the different eyesecs

1174
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,599
uh so information sharing alliances uh

1175
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
for instance the fsisik in the financial

1176
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,079
space

1177
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,480
the there's an energy side um isaac and

1178
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
so on

1179
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,040
they've been created and made

1180
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,520
with a structure that both the private

1181
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,359
and public sector cooperate

1182
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,400
um and also uh exchange um not just

1183
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
uh you know operative threat

1184
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,520
intelligence but also

1185
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,560
a lot of insights on tactics um on um

1186
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
you know best practices on counter

1187
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,520
measures

1188
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,560
and so on i think we do have very very

1189
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,880
solid first steps uh we went

1190
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,760
you know pushing as well our um our

1191
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
countries in this direction there are

1192
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,920
great examples

1193
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,119
um again in germany with you know cssa

1194
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,319
or dcso in the uk with cyber defense

1195
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,760
alliance for instance in the financial

1196
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,119
sector space

1197
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,760
but i guess the the partnership between

1198
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,599
the public and the private sector

1199
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,000
is still very very weak compared to the

1200
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,800
us

1201
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,960
and this has as well some other aspects

1202
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,640
simply because in the us it's very

1203
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,079
common that

1204
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,640
you would swap as an individual during

1205
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,839
your career between the

1206
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,839
private and public sector and by that

1207
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,599
already get a much more better

1208
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,200
understanding for the other world right

1209
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,119
in the public sector

1210
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,560
things are working completely different

1211
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,480
in the private sector

1212
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,640
i do not see this too often in europe

1213
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,400
unfortunately i think therefore

1214
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,079
these two sectors remain very often

1215
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,280
isolated or not not well understood well

1216
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,839
i guess

1217
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,160
the problems um the set of problems in

1218
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,000
both sectors is the same and

1219
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,240
a partnership would definitely create

1220
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,760
much more better

1221
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,960
yeah results on that aspect and perhaps

1222
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,720
um

1223
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,200
one quick comment as well to uh to the

1224
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,280
to the previous question on you know

1225
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,880
how to build specifically um or try to

1226
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,280
you know to to support and subsidize

1227
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,640
basically

1228
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,880
this digital serenity in europe as well

1229
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,960
a couple of um days ago i've looked up

1230
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,520
for the

1231
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,920
for the venture funding um which went

1232
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
into the cyber security space

1233
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,480
during the last year and this is pretty

1234
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,839
pretty much related because i think a

1235
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,280
lot of this innovation is not happening

1236
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,680
just

1237
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,520
top down from the government um to the

1238
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,960
industry but also from the industry to

1239
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
the government right being presented as

1240
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,520
an idea

1241
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,079
and last year there were more than 7.8

1242
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,200
billion invested

1243
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,480
um into cyber security and 76 percent

1244
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,079
of the spending went to the u.s

1245
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,400
companies 20 to israel

1246
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,520
so 96 percent of funding um and out of

1247
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,079
this 96 percent of funding 85

1248
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,839
funding was seed finding so new

1249
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,520
companies being created

1250
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,640
they went to do to these countries right

1251
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,480
and what does it mean for us right

1252
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
having such a scenario it means that

1253
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,040
um there's definitely a lot of money

1254
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
having worked in the financial industry

1255
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,440
i can say

1256
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,040
money finds always you know the right

1257
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,680
company if you present the right problem

1258
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,599
and if you start to work on this problem

1259
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,359
uh very early on

1260
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,920
so i guess the challenge here is not

1261
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,960
really

1262
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
not throwing money on the sector i think

1263
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,240
we need to really to try to focus on the

1264
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,000
problem and not the symptoms so

1265
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,920
having first of all um a proper plan how

1266
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,560
we

1267
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
uh how we grow the the cyber skills

1268
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,599
right i think there's a clear

1269
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,359
misalignment between

1270
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,680
the you know the formal education and

1271
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,520
and the private sector demands um

1272
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,280
in that space so creating more

1273
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,960
professorships position

1274
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,680
um you know investing more in research

1275
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,440
on the other hand trying to

1276
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,839
um to create the demand as bone cyber

1277
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,520
for cyber security in europe

1278
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,160
simply because um you know we are we are

1279
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,040
lacking very

1280
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,160
often the awareness um and have to learn

1281
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,720
the hard way before the hex is happening

1282
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,160
and i think that's something where we

1283
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,720
can also be a bit creative

1284
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,760
between yesterday formally she was

1285
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,280
presenting as well the concept of cyber

1286
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,880
insurances and i think

1287
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,480
that could be for instance such a tool

1288
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
instrument to say hey let's make cyber

1289
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,880
insurance is mandatory for every company

1290
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,359
and by that guarantee a free assessment

1291
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,319
for the companies

1292
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,720
who do not have this risk understanding

1293
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,079
right and who understand them that they

1294
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:28,400
have

1295
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,880
to pay more so creating this demand

1296
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,720
creating this market will also help to

1297
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,839
mature

1298
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,520
um you know mature the cyber security um

1299
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,760
community and then in the end you have

1300
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,920
as a final step just to create

1301
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
the right environment for founders um i

1302
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,520
think it's so challenging in some of the

1303
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,640
european countries

1304
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,800
uh in terms of taxation and so on for

1305
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
founders who are taking more risk

1306
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,040
really to get this benefits from for

1307
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
more risks right

1308
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,040
so that's also a problem which remains

1309
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
um not just in cyber work but of course

1310
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,520
for the

1311
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,280
startups and founders in the space so i

1312
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,560
think the good news

1313
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,880
is the money is there and always finds

1314
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
its way so we have just to focus really

1315
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,160
on the foundation

1316
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,640
thank you yes thank you so much

1317
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,720
unfortunately uh there would be a lot to

1318
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,520
discuss

1319
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,160
uh but we're at the end of our time and

1320
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,760
uh we're now entering into the coffee

1321
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,000
break

1322
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
i'm surprised though and uh excited to

1323
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,000
see that that

1324
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,839
uh we're actually having a lot more

1325
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,680
alignment on those topics of digital

1326
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,440
sovereignty these days than just a few

1327
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,400
years ago

1328
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,760
and we can really see that the

1329
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,680
discussion has matured quite a lot but

1330
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,160
several

1331
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,560
ideas are getting much more concrete and

1332
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,400
that we're also getting support

1333
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,560
uh from the united states and other

1334
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,599
countries to

1335
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,800
develop more sovereignty in europe um so

1336
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,480
this i believe is also in the spirit of

1337
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,200
what both

1338
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,359
is said at the beginning that more

1339
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,400
digital sovereignty

1340
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,240
in europe is not something not a

1341
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,880
situation that creates competition

1342
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,040
but rather something that enhances

1343
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,280
opportunities for cooperation

1344
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
so in that spirit i'd also like to thank

1345
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,240
you uh your panel members for joining

1346
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,079
it was a privilege to have you thank you

1347
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,680
very much and now everybody enjoy the

1348
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,640
coffee break thank you

1349
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,160
thank you very much for this panel on

1350
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,520
digital sovereignty

1351
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,160
thank you sandra gaiken thank you robert
