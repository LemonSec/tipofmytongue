1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,199
conferences like this are not

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,240
possible without good partners and good

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,080
partners we have found we have good

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,440
speakers found

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,920
and therefore i'm very glad that we have

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,799
made this

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,079
with record numbers in participation and

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,160
in people who contribute to this kind of

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,680
conference

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
and in order to have a good opening we

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,279
have lined up

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
quite a good number of high caliber

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,800
speakers

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
and the very first person i would like

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,240
to introduce to open

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
this conference today is ambassador

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
wolfgang ischina

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
ambassador wolfgang ischinger is the

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,320
chairman of the munich security

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,840
conference which is the largest

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,559
conference

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
on security issues in the world at all

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
and he has been kind of a founding

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,680
father for us as well he has supported

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
it right from the beginning

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
and typically we have done it one day

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,879
prior to the munich

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,879
security conference and that's where the

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
name come from munich cyber security

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,320
conference

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
which becomes a very large conference

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,399
for cyber security issues in the

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,520
meantime

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920

conference

42
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
um as most of you will be aware the

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
munich security conference

44
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,080
was able to organize a very high level

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,479
virtual event earlier this year at the

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,600
end of february

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
also uh transmitted from the hotel by

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,400
jehovah so this is a

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
continuation of a new tradition

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,759
i want to uh particularly pay tribute to

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,560

uh of the munich security conference and

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
we are we're indebted

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
uh to the company for their uh for

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,318
sharing their expertise

62
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,720
and for helping us move forward

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
the role of digital technology

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,879
has not only grown it has literally

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,000
exploded

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080
as we have learned through this year

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,560
of the pandemic we are

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
waking up as a matter of fact to a new

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,360
reality the new reality is that

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,959
data is power and data

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
in the future is also going to be

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,560
synonymous

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
with prosperity so this is important not

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,280
only for the technology nerds this is

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
important for all of us for citizens for

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,599
governments

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,840
for the business community of course

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,000
most centrally

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
let me make three quick points first

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
europe needs to become more

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
capable when it comes to mastering

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,440
regulating and innovating digital

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
technologies

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,159
this is simply a matter of guaranteeing

85
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,000
our security and economic future

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,599
and and also of promoting

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,040
our own human values including

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,760
data protection and privacy

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
considerations

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,440
second when we talk about

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,640
european sovereignty it's

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,840
important that this is not the same

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,799
as disrupting as wishing to disrupt our

94
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
relationship across the atlantic on the

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
contrary

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
european digital sovereignty

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,920
will work only if it is coordinated if

98
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,480
it is done with close coordination

99
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,959
across the atlantic and let me take this

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,080
this other step

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
uh step further

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
we as we need to understand that

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
our digital sovereignty will depend on

104
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
cooperation with the united states

105
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,320
i hope that our american friends will

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,720
also understand that european digital

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,960
sovereignty is not against them it's not

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
directed against them or against nato

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,600
or against the close transatlantic

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,560
partnership

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
if europe becomes more capable this is

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,000
also

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
going to be an asset to the united

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
states

115
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,520
so we need to pursue

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
a common we need to develop and pursue a

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,280
common

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,639
transatlantic digital agenda the problem

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
here is a very fundamental one it is a

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
fundamental problem of international

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
relations it's the question of

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,479
trust and mistrust the lack of trust

123
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,880
the munich security conference has

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
recently

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
organized a poll the results of which

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,320
are worrisome the results are that

127
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
we don't trust each other we don't trust

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
our governments

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,759
we have problems our citizens have

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
problems trusting the companies

131
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
but even more importantly we don't trust

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
each other across the atlantic

133
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,199
of course we don't trust the chinese but

134
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,320
german citizens

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
don't trust the united states either in

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,080
other words if we want

137
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
this common transatlantic digital agenda

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,160
to prosper and and and and to grow

139
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,639
we need to build trust trust as i have

140
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
often said

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
i'm sure many of you will have heard me

142
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
say this before trust

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,440
is the currency of diplomacy

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,639
in the absence of trust

145
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
negotiation completion is

146
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,360
almost inconceivable with trust

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
literally nothing is impossible where

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
diplomacy

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,120
and cyberspace meet trust is therefore

150
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
of the essence

151
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
so let me end on this particular point

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
how do we promote europe's

153
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,280
digital capabilities while promoting

154
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
trust across the atlantic at the same

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,319
time

156
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
i would be very happy if some of the

157
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
attention

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
of this particular conference which is

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
now being started

160
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
today could be devoted to this double

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
challenge that we're going to be facing

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,479
in coming

163
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,919
days months and years i wish you

164
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,120
a great conference thank you very much

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
thank you ambassador ishinger and as we

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
know him

167
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
direct words to direct problems

168
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
and if i pick one point of wolfgang

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,039
ischino's speech

170
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,560
is europe's capabilities then i pull

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,960
back

172
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
on my introduction speech where i say

173
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
that china has catched up with the

174
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
united states in terms of

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
innovation spent in technology r d

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
approximately both countries line up at

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
600 billion

178
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
us dollars per year europe

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
altogether brings it to 500. so my

180
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
thesis is

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
europe has it all and has all in their

182
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,599
hands

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
in order to make it happen so there is

184
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,039
no hurdle

185
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,120
and the point wolfgang made is

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
coordination and speed is of essence
