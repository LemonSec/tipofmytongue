00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
madam minister my good friend marina so

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
we will have a good discussion thank you

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,119
for inviting me

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,560
uh madeleine we're living through

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,320
challenging times

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
besides covet pandemic there are other

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
worrying developments

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
yesterday for example the european

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,320
parliament adopted a very critical

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
resolution on russia's aggressive

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,439
behavior

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,799
the russian relations are at its lowest

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
u.s administration expelled russian

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,840
diplomats

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
and russia retaliated also china is

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
becoming more assertive

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,159
powerful and vocal dear madeleine you

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,640
are known for thinking out of the box

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
and you are known for bold ideas what is

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
your take on the present international

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
situation

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
and more precisely on transatlantic

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
relations

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
what is your advice to us and european

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,799
leaders

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
because needless to say europe was

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
excited and happy

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,360
after the last presidential elections

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,878
president biden has a standing

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
invitation to come to brussels

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,440
we're waiting to see him here and i know

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,160
that he will do it soon

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,440
well i you have asked many questions

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,879
that really show

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,239
i think the world is a mess that's a

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,640
diplomatic term of art things are bad

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,959
i really do think that if one looks at

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,680
the various

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
issues that are out there beyond the

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
ones that you mentioned

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
in terms of what russia is doing what

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
china's doing

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
the challenge of climate change

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
obviously the kovid

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
but also that there are issues

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,760
throughout the world

76
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
in different countries uh every

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
continent there are some

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
issues that need to be dealt with and

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,400
part of the issue frankly is also

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
that we don't have the international

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
institutions

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
that are in many ways up to speed in

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
terms of dealing

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
with them they need to be rejuvenated in

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
some ways and we need to decide which

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,640
ones

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
are the ones that really are operational

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
i do think that what has made a

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,879
difference in the united states

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,840
is the election of president biden who

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
has a very different approach

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
and by the way he's somebody that i know

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,319
very well because

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,799
we worked together when he was a senator

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,920
uh and i

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
was secretary and we knew each other

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,360
even before that and

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
he has a very broad understanding of

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
international issues i think

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
um and frankly probably more than any

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
president we've had in

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,159
in in a very long time and a deep

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,959
interest

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
and he understands and it started with

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
his inauguration speech

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
that we america had to be back america

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,439
had to be

108
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,000
a part of the system and that we would

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,720
re-enter

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
the system with humility and i think

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
that that is the way he is approaching

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
things

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
um he gave a very interesting speech um

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
two days ago two nights ago in congress

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,840
in which he outlined a very different

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,799
approach to the

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
uh the issues in the united states and

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
that have to be dealt with

119
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
but at the same time i think made clear

120
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,919
to the american public

121
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
as he talked about the national security

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
issues how domestic and foreign policy

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,680
go together

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
which i think is a very important part

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
um in a democracy

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
by the way i think that one thing

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
that i have been reading the

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
intelligence community our

129
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
our intelligence community has just put

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
out a document

131
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,919
global trends 2040. it's unclassified

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
and they have made very clear what the

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
various issues are that have to be dealt

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,440
with

135
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,400
um some that are immediate but some that

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
are the longer term ones

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
that need to be dealt with now in a very

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
specific way with

139
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,039
partners which leads me to one of the

140
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
things you also ask the transatlantic

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
relationship

142
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,680
is absolutely essential uh and i think

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,240
that

144
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
it's something that was very important

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,840
before

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
um and as a result of what happened in

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,199
world war ii

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
but we now have to make clear that it is

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
a crucial aspect of how we

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
work and live together uh thank you

151
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,919
madam

152
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,400
you are known for being a very strong

153
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
supporter of transatlantic ties

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,000
and it's really encouraging to hear from

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
both sides of the atlantic ocean

156
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
that there is interest there is

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,759
willingness

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
there is a commitment to have new or to

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,000
restore

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
the work of nato to give more impetus to

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,840
nato

162
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,479
and to have closer transatlantic ties so

163
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
from brussels i can only say that we're

164
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,759
looking forward

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,919
to president biden's visit to brussels

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,360
but coming to another topic i'm really

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
happy and honored to be part of your

168
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,639
group of exes well who don't know

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,160
that's the club or group of former

170
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
foreign ministers but then you keep us

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,919
busy

172
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
you keep us busy about learning about

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
new topics

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
discussing new topics you keep us busy

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,319
about

176
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,280
thinking about the world today and

177
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
making that suggest a big making

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
suggestions to the better world

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
to come so recently we had series of

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
presentations and discussions about uh

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,919
cyber security

182
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
uh pandemic has brought digital topics

183
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,720
to the center of political attention

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,960
everybody is discussing digital

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,039
everybody's going digital

186
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
but if we look from the perspective of

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
cyber security

188
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,520
how do you see the biggest challenges

189
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
for international community

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,840
but also for our transatlantic

191
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,960
i think it is at the basis of

192
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,759
what the future is bringing to us and

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,160
yet

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
i have to say i think that even a lot of

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
experts don't understand all the

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
ramifications of it

197
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,759
and uh average people in countries do

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,240
know

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,319
that there's the internet of everything

200
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
and that that

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,440
you know their refrigerator talks to

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
them or um

203
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
that things are very automatic but they

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,880
don't uh see

205
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
the other side of this what what are we

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
learning what

207
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
um uh who is in control uh what do we

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,919
know

209
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,240
and again this particular report our the

210
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
this global trends

211
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
i think um has a whole section

212
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
on the impact of technology on our daily

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,520
lives

214
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
and the importance of understanding and

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,720
especially

216
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,879
i think issues to do with artificial

217
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,080
intelligence

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,120
um the whole issue of cyber

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,879
of whether cyber is a friend or an enemy

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,000
and so and it's very interesting because

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
one of the things is that what has

222
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
happened as i mentioned

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
there is the internet of things but it

224
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,039
is actually

225
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
also led to fragmentation in our

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
societies

227
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
because it exacerbates the divisions

228
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
and i think we need to know the social

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
effect of all of this

230
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
and then the other part if i may say is

231
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,160
that you

232
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,319
are in brussels and the eu makes rules

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,679
and we don't yet have norms that really

234
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,399
govern

235
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,360
how the cyber systems uh how artificial

236
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
intelligence works

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,399
and even though the euro atlanta the

238
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,839
transatlantic relationship is the most

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,320
basic one in terms of values we need to

240
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
figure out

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
how to use the systems to develop some

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
norms

243
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
that we understand what is really

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
happening but it has affected it's

245
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
affected our elections it's affected

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,839
um how we see what the russians are

247
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,560
doing

248
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,040
um in uh central and eastern europe to

249
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
undermine democracy

250
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
it affects how the chinese are operating

251
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,800
so it is a a new

252
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
it's some in some ways it's a gift and

253
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
in another way

254
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,160
it's kind of the genie out of the bottle

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
trying to figure out

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,519
uh what we do with it and therefore

257
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,480
having

258
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
these kinds of discussions uh whether we

259
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
have it among the former foreign

260
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,399
ministers or

261
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
we have it with people that are in power

262
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
now as you are in the parliament

263
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,920
um and then also that the average people

264
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
understand

265
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
what is going on with this it's a very

266
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
very big assignment

267
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
i very much agree with your emphasis on

268
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,040
international law

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
norms because we need clear

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,320
understanding

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
what are the rules of behavior in

272
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,760
cyberspace

273
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,680
we've been seeing we've been saying that

274
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,160
international law applies to cyber

275
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,040
but unfortunately we do not we do not

276
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
see that the whole words

277
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,440
world acts according to the words

278
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
unfortunately we see in the united

279
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,160
nations

280
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,519
and internationally division ideological

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,200
division between different

282
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
different states so how to continue

283
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
discussion on multilateral level

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,720
multi-stakehold the level level in these

285
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
difficult circumstances well i think the

286
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,839
hard part is

287
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
that we do come at it differently i mean

288
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,279
the

289
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,600
i have to say democracies we believe in

290
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,440
free speech and freedom

291
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
um and the opportunity to exchange

292
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
information and to understand each other

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
the authoritarian governments are able

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
to use this tool to control people

295
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
and to undermine the way that we

296
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
understand each other

297
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
and so developing those norms and it's

298
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,680
very hard

299
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
in organizations where everybody is

300
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
represented but we need to

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
understand this and this is going to

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,600
take

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
a lot of effort um in order to

304
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
develop the norms and the truth is um

305
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,279
you know i always say this i

306
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,800
i was born in prague and i just happened

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
to have been raised in the united states

308
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,279
so i'm the example of the transatlantic

309
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,240
relationship and we disagree often we

310
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,959
disagree

311
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
in terms of some of the rules on privacy

312
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,600
a number of ways that we do things

313
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,160
and yet we have more in common than any

314
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
other group of people and so i do think

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
that we are going to have to be take a

316
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,839
leadership

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,040
role in this and you have frankly

318
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
i think it's been remarkable and also

319
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,920
you come from a country that has been um

320
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,760
uh really uh modern in many ways for a

321
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,800
long time

322
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,720
in terms of being an e-country that

323
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
really understands it

324
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
but you have also been the victim

325
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,639
of attacks from the outside uh

326
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,600
through this new uh tool and so i think

327
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
there's nobody better

328
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
than a representative of estonia to

329
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,040
really be leading this discussion

330
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
thank you for your kind remarks but

331
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
still i'd say that we need different

332
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,519
voices

333
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
we need people coming from very

334
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
different backgrounds

335
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
and coming from the cyber security

336
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
community

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
i'd say that we also need globally

338
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
strong

339
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
and committed u.s voice when we talk

340
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
about digital topics

341
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,079
when i talk about cyber security we

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
missed it

343
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
hopefully it will be now back on

344
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,360
international arena

345
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,399
i we are we'll will be back i have to

346
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:38,880
say

347
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
there's a great desire to be back and

348
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,079
president biden

349
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,560
has made that clear but what is also

350
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
interesting

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,000
is that there have been commissions that

352
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,519
have been looking about what to do

353
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
something called the solarium commission

354
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
that had a set of recommendations about

355
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,680
how to strengthen

356
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
the internal structure of the u.s

357
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,720
government

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,959
in order to be able to deal with this

359
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,720
that it's not just the defense

360
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
department

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,079
that is really a whole of government

362
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,440
there has now been somebody

363
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
who came to speak to our group um last

364
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
time cresingus who's been named

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
as the chief officer to really deal with

366
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,519
this

367
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,480
out of the white house um and there is

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
going to be an approach how to work this

369
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,800
the other part that makes this both

370
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,720
interesting and complicated

371
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
it is just it's not just governments

372
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
it's the private sector

373
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
and that relationship between the public

374
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,800
and private sector

375
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
is something that also is a challenge

376
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,560
for you

377
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
and for us and how we do this so the

378
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
more we do together

379
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,160
the better i i i can completely agree

380
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
with everything you said

381
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
uh dear madeline you know what day it

382
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
was yesterday

383
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
it was the 29th of april and

384
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
europe celebrated the day of solidarity

385
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
between generations

386
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,880
it was first introduced in 2012

387
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
and i have to say that it is becoming

388
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,399
more and more popular

389
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,959
among different generations and i'm

390
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,320
proud that i have at home for

391
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
generations

392
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
my mother 95 my grandson seven months

393
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,440
old

394
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
so i do have i have the privilege of

395
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
living with different generations

396
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,959
dear madeleine you are always known for

397
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,720
being inspiring

398
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
to all generations to different

399
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,760
generations

400
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
and especially to women to women in

401
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
politics the woman in diplomacy

402
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
the woman in cyber security but then

403
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
what would you like to say

404
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
today to women and maybe especially

405
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
to young women who are watching you

406
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,519
well i do think that we have been

407
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
watching how there have been more women

408
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,720
that have come into places uh in the

409
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
political world and the business world

410
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
and the educational world scientific

411
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,760
world

412
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
and and i can believe very strongly the

413
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
most famous thing i ever said

414
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
was that there's a special place in hell

415
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,279
for women who don't support each other

416
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,680
we need to have more women in the room

417
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
it always helps

418
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,320
and when you became part of my group of

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
former foreigners we have now have

420
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,720
more of us there but i also

421
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
do think the cross generational thing is

422
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,240
so important

423
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,399
because i think it is accurate to say

424
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,040
that the younger generation understands

425
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,639
technology better

426
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,279
than the others and one of the we have a

427
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,240
very famous

428
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,519
poet robert frost who said the older i

429
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,600
am the younger are my teachers

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
and that is the way i feel now about the

431
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
younger generation

432
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
men and women how they work together and

433
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,759
they

434
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,360
really have a better sense of the

435
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,399
technology but i am delighted to see

436
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,560
uh women and by the way there was a

437
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
great picture

438
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,399
i talked about president biden's speech

439
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,680
to congress

440
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,320
it was the first time in history excuse

441
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,680
me that two women

442
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,560
were sitting behind him the uh speaker

443
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,199
of the house

444
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,600
nancy pelosi and our vice president

445
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,720
kamala harris

446
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
it is a big step forward america always

447
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
wants to be first in everything we're

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
not first

449
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,360
in terms of women prime ministers and

450
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,839
women

451
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
presidents but we are working on it and

452
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,000
we all have to work

453
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,959
together and the support that women give

454
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,920
to each other

455
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
i think is very very important which is

456
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,079
why i love having you

457
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
