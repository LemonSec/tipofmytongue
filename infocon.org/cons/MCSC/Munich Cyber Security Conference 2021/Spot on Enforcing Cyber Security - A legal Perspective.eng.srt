00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
joining us at the munich cyber security

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
forum you're a familiar face to those of

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,640
us who've covered

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
national security from your time as a

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960

to the department of justice and i'm

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
imagining that cyber security is now the

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
top of your

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
list uh and when it comes to your

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,759
interest could you give us a sense

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,720
really what your

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,318
priorities are and what i think is your

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
first week in office

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,920
well thanks so much gordon and it's

67
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
great to be with you and it's great to

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,760
be part

69
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
of this conference to be part of this

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
forum um

71
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,440
it is especially timely and especially

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
important when we look at the array of

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
threats facing us

74
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,879
in the cyber realm you're quite right i

75
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,120
am in my first week on the job i think

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,160
we're at day five

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
gordon and i'm just thrilled to be back

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
at the justice department

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,800
it was my home for 15 years where i

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
learned to be a lawyer where i learned

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
to be a public servant

82
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
and so i'm thrilled to be back at the

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
department

84
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
and serving here again when it comes to

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,959
priorities the attorney general and i

86
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,080
have been quite clear

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
first and foremost we will lead the

88
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
department consistent with its

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,879
foundational values

90
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,680
going uh to advance civil rights and

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
equal justice under law

92
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
and very importantly protecting from

93
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
emerging threats and threats we face in

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
the here and now

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
and that of course means extremism in

96
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
all its forms from foreign and domestic

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,239
and critically and top of my priority

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:12,720
list

99
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
the cyber threat and this is one where

100
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,920
gordon

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,959
i have seen uh evolve over my time in

102
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,440
government

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
and since leaving government and coming

104
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
back

105
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,599
it has exploded it has become more

106
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,480
diffuse

107
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,799
more sophisticated more dangerous than

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,760
ever before

109
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
i think we're at a pivot point yet again

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
when it comes

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
to the cyber threat i've seen this

112
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
evolve over time indeed

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
when i was the homeland security advisor

114
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
i met with the president every morning

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
on the most urgent threats

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,159
of facing the nation and what i found in

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,720
that

118
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
is that over time i spent more and more

119
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,760
time in that briefing every morning

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,319
talking to him about cyber threats

121
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,080
whether it's from nation states

122
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
or criminal enterprises and

123
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
you don't need though a presidential

124
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
briefing every morning to understand

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,840
that the cyber threat has exploded and

126
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
today as i return to the justice

127
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
department what i'm seeing

128
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
is that we are at this pivot point and i

129
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,519
think what distinguishes

130
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
today's threat and what i'm seeing and

131
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,519
what i'm acutely focused on

132
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
and what we will be focusing on here in

133
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,959
the department is

134
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
how malicious actors are exploiting the

135
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
technology

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
that has been such a boon

137
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
to our commerce to free speech to the

138
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
way we communicate to the way we drive

139
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
you name it we have over time moved all

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
of that

141
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
uh everything we do from the analog to

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
the digital space

143
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
but we didn't do it with security in

144
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,520
mind as this group uh convening today

145
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,960
knows all too well well we're at another

146
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,479
point where

147
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,280
new technologies and connectivity is

148
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
exploding

149
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
in a way that i think we really have to

150
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,759
think about

151
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
how the bad actors are exploiting it and

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
what we're seeing now

153
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,479
is that technology that innovation the

154
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,440
way we are

155
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
um using uh new innovation and

156
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,960
technology

157
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
it's being used against us and it's

158
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
being used against us by nation-state

159
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
adversaries by criminal enterprises

160
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,280
and we see it in the supply chain attack

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
in solar winds

162
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,560
we see it in um the use of ransomware

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
and we launched a ransomware task force

164
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,759
just last week

165
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
to really go after uh that particular

166
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
manifestation

167
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,479
of the cyber threat but we need to

168
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,280
rethink

169
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,520
as your title of the conference rightly

170
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,800
points out

171
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
and really assess are we using the most

172
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
effective

173
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
strategies against this kind of new

174
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,199
evolution this pivot point

175
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
that i think we're at today in the cyber

176
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,039
threat and that's why

177
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
gordon uh we are launching this week

178
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,759
under my direction a review of how the

179
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,800
department

180
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,840
is looking at exactly this set of

181
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
challenges

182
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
uh we want to bring forth

183
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
actionable recommendations uh in a

184
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,680
120 day time frame so there is no time

185
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
to lose

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,479
on what can we be doing better working

187
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,840
with our partners

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
across borders to address these to

189
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
address these threats things like

190
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
how is digital currency becoming a tool

191
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,240
uh

192
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
and something that is also exploited

193
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
what are we doing about the

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
supply chain attacks that we're seeing

195
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,840
how can we address

196
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,880
the blended threat of nation states and

197
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
criminal enterprises sometimes working

198
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,759
together

199
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
to exploit our own infrastructure

200
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,440
against us so

201
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
there is a great deal to do and we're

202
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
launching this review to make sure we

203
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,720
are

204
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
bringing all the tools we can uh to

205
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,400
address it

206
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
let's pick up on a few of those uh

207
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,919
issues in the time we've got you

208
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
mentioned ransomware there in the review

209
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
that is clearly a growing problem i mean

210
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
we there were reports i think the

211
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
washington dc police department got as a

212
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,199
ransomware attacked in the last week

213
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
we heard reports in germany last year i

214
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
think of a potentially a patient dying

215
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
because a hospital they were due to go

216
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
to was hit by a ransomware attack

217
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
lots of issues um surrounding that which

218
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,759
are having a real impact on people's

219
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
lives what do you think can be done

220
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,800
about this program

221
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
problem which feels like it's almost

222
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
exploding in volume well it is and i

223
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,080
think last year was the worst year we

224
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,759
have experienced to date when it comes

225
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,960
to ransomware

226
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,080
billions of dollars of

227
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
impact on victims from fortune 500

228
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,319
companies to small businesses

229
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,280
to governments alike at all levels as

230
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
you rightly point out

231
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,120
um and it is not just about money it's

232
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
about mayhem

233
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
right as you point out when uh

234
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
the victim is a hospital we're talking

235
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,639
life and death

236
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,360
uh so and when a victim is a critical

237
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
infrastructure holder we are talking

238
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,479
uh the main avenues of how we uh

239
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,720
power our grid how we get our water

240
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,599
supply

241
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,280
you name it so this is something that we

242
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
are acutely focused on we've launched

243
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
this ransomware

244
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,280
and digital uh extortion task force

245
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,039
because here again what we're seeing

246
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
in some of these uh cases is the use of

247
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,199
ransomware

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
not just to extort money but to hold

249
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
hostage

250
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
critical pieces of information whether

251
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,840
it's hospital records whether it's

252
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,400
proprietary technology so i think what

253
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,599
we need to do and what our

254
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,240
task force will be focused on is how do

255
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,039
we

256
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
go after the entire ecosystem that is

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,839
being used the infrastructure that bad

258
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,120
actors are using

259
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,599
the digital currency they're using uh as

260
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,399
a means

261
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,279
to uh to perpetrate their extortion

262
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,839
efforts

263
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
you name it we have to take a holistic

264
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,040
look at it

265
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
so that means going after that

266
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,160
infrastructure the

267
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
the support infrastructure if you like a

268
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
slightly more

269
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,320
uh less just playing defense but trying

270
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
to go on the offense a bit more about

271
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
those who are behind these acts is that

272
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
right

273
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
that's exactly right and that's why

274
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
we're launching this review

275
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,480
uh this week because ransomware is one

276
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
manifestation

277
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
uh which we are now seeing in the

278
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,959
headlines but

279
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,399
more broadly what else what is the next

280
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,839
ransomware that we're going to have to

281
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,320
deal with what is the next exploitation

282
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,600
uh by bad actors of other technologies

283
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,959
whether it's ai

284
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,440
again digital currency issues what is

285
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,080
the next

286
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
iteration of the supply chain attack

287
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
that we've seen

288
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
so of course the justice department has

289
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
tools that it can use and we are working

290
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
every day

291
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
with our partners to disrupt

292
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
to deter and to hold accountable

293
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
malicious

294
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
cyber actors using these and exploiting

295
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
these technologies

296
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
but we have got to move at the same

297
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,399
speed

298
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
that our adversaries are it was

299
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
interesting i think in the

300
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,279
last week or so the uh department of

301
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,440
justice authorized the fbi to go after

302
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,560
some of the

303
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
the the the malicious software which had

304
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
been installed on computers quite a kind

305
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,640
of

306
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
forward-leaning move is that the kind of

307
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,279
thing we can expect to see more

308
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,920
absolutely we need to be working again

309
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,880
with our partners

310
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
overseas we have done some of the best

311
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,920
work

312
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
working with our partners in europe

313
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,360
working with

314
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
the private sector to go after that

315
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,480
infrastructure

316
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
you uh of course know and the and the

317
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
folks attending this conference know the

318
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,160
immodenet uh bot takedown uh was a

319
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,440
great um example of partnership going

320
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
after

321
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
the exploitation of infrastructure by

322
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
malicious actors

323
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
sharing more information with the

324
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
private sector

325
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
working closely with the private sector

326
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
who of course the victims on the front

327
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,760
lines

328
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
of these attacks so we have got to get

329
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,600
innovative

330
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
uh and aggressive uh and we have to work

331
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
collaboratively and cooperatively with

332
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,720
our partners and with the private sector

333
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
if we are going to keep pace with what

334
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
the malicious actors are doing

335
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
we talked about the rise in ransomware

336
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
there also seems to have been a more

337
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
aggressive posture from some nation

338
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,399
states

339
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
um clearly russia with the solar winds

340
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
attack also

341
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
the microsoft exchange incident which

342
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,519
was linked to actors

343
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,680
in in china um in the past the

344
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
department of justice

345
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
has been quite forward-leaning in

346
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
indicting individuals sometimes

347
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
and has done that going back to i mean i

348
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,360
think to chinese actors

349
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
back during the obama administration do

350
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,880
you feel that that

351
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
will it is working as a tactic

352
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,200
um does it serve to deter them what else

353
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
can be done to deter or is it just a

354
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,040
question of disrupting

355
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,079
some of these activities by states

356
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,200
we've got to do both gordon and um i am

357
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
a proponent

358
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
of um of taking that approach you you

359
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,800
point out the the work the justice

360
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
department did against chinese

361
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
cyber actors that's work that i began

362
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,519
when i was the head of the national

363
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,000
security

364
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,639
division the last time i was in the

365
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,360
department

366
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
and we honed our focus we saw nation

367
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
states

368
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,839
exploiting the cyber realm um to

369
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,519
do what i call geopolitical

370
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
one-upsmanship they are going after our

371
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,760
intellectual property they're going

372
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
after research and development and yes

373
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,480
going after

374
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
state secrets and doing traditional

375
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,959
espionage um but we've got to focus on

376
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,480
the use that nation states

377
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
china russia iran north korea are making

378
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,279
of these tools and certainly the

379
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
criminal justice process

380
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
identifying calling out and

381
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
holding to account those actors is one

382
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,079
tool

383
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,839
the use of sanctions as you have seen

384
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,560
working with partners uh is another tool

385
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,360
uh exposing i think very important to

386
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
expose this activity

387
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
uh to marginalize it to the extent we

388
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,959
can and then work with partners

389
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,560
to deter and disrupt it lisa monaco

390
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920

391
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,519

focus on ransomware and going after the

395
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,440
