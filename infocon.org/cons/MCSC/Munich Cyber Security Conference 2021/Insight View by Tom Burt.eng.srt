00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
uh the organization formulates and

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,640
advocates for cyber security policy

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,680
and norms on a global basis advancing

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,800
digital peace

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
through initiatives such as the paris

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
peace forum the cyber security tech

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,599
accord

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,880
and the defending democracy program

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
collaborating with public and private

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
organizations

16

tom bird will now give us his inside

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,000
view

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,719
go ahead tom

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,399
well thank you so much for the

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,239
opportunity to contribute to this

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:44,879
excellent

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,360
and important conference and to offer a

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
few thoughts from microsoft's

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,320
perspective

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
to start i thought we could review some

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
of the significant strides forward

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
that have been realized by the global

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
cyber security community from our

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,960
perspective

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
first over two years ago the paris call

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,920
for trust and security and cyberspace

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
united governments industry civil

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
society and

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
academia on nine principles of stability

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
in cyberspace

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
microsoft was one of the initiatives

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
early supporters

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,759
and the paris call has grown to include

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,000
over a thousand signatories

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
79 of which are governments many of

41
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,200
those signatories organized themselves

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
into communities of interest

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,799
which have been working together to

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
further the principles of the paris call

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,880
in what's in one such community that was

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
focused on election security

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
microsoft the alliance for securing

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
democracy and the government of canada

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
collaborated together and consulted

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,159
experts from around the world

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,680
leading to a compendium of

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,000
recommendations on election security

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,119
that was published just last week

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,759
and in november 2020 on the anniversary

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,040
of the paris call

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
the french government announced the

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
creation of six additional working

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,520
groups

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,360
leveraging the paris call community to

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
advance international norms

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,639
and create and cooperate on concrete

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
initiatives

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,920
that build on the calls principles and

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,840
improve overall cyber security posture

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
the oxford process has emerged as an

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
important collaborative effort

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
by the world's international law experts

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,080
to define

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
applicability of international law to

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
critical cyber security questions

71
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,599
and just yesterday the un general

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
assembly adopted the report of its

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,360
open-ended working group

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
this process was the first time that u.n

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
discussions on peace and stability in

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,360
cyberspace

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
were open to all u.n nations

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
and the oewg for the first time

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,599
consulted the private sector as well

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
the report reaffirms application of

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,120
international law

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,840
and existing agreements but adds a call

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
for protections for the security of

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,280
healthcare organizations

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
and supply chains two areas that have

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,319
been

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,480
under relentless attack in recent months

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
the report does not do all it could have

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,080
done we would have loved to have seen

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
greater emphasis on human rights and a

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,360
stronger commitment

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
to international humanitarian law in the

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,599
text of the report

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,920
but nevertheless the report's adoption

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,959
sends a strong

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,040
signal that consensus at the

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
international level is possible

98
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
even on issues that lie at the heart of

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
future geopolitical competition

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
we hope that this signal will be

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
repeated in other u.n discussions on

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
cyber security

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
in the coming weeks and months

104
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,440
but despite all this progress

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
the global digital ecosystem remains

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
subject to

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,280
daily attacks by nation state actors and

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,799
cyber criminals

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,959
and those attacks are increasing in

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,080
frequency

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
in sophistication and in impact

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
i thought i'd spend a few minutes

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
discussing two of the more notorious

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
recent attacks

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
that i believe provide some important

116
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
lessons for us all to consider

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
and and for the conference to consider

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,080
how we can work

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,280
to advance the issues of cyber peace and

120
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
cyber security

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
the first attack that i'd like to

122
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
address was the solarwinds attack

123
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
it started in about march of 2020 and

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
was not discovered into

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,560
late november of 2020 this was an attack

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
that has been attributed to the russian

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
svr

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
this attack was conducted by corrupting

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,600
the update process

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
for a popular application from the

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
solarwinds company

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
a technique that was also done in the

133
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,120
not petya attack in the ukraine

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
in this case the application was a

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
network monitoring

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,080
optimization application the attacker

137
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
likely penetrated the solarwinds network

138
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,199
initially

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,040
through password spray or some similar

140
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
technique

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
but it then inserted malware

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
into the update package for this popular

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,520
application

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
as it was being built and that app that

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
um application together with the malware

146
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
was then downloaded

147
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,000
as an update by 18 000 of solarwinds

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
customers

149
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,320
which automatically opened back doors to

150
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
each of those 18 000

151
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
networks now as it turned out

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
the attacker was not interested in 18

153
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,759
000 networks

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
they picked and chose about 100 maybe as

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,120
many as

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,080
200 espionage targets they identified

157
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
those targets entered through the back

158
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,639
door

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
established a secondary malware package

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
on those networks

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
that they then used to steal credentials

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,400
in these on-premises networks

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
those credentials were not carefully or

164
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
adequately protected

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
they obtained escalated administration

166
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,600
privileges

167
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
in the victims on premises networks so

168
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,800
that they had

169
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
all the authority of a network

170
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
administrator and then they used those

171
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
privileges

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
to view and exfiltrate data from the

173
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,440
on-premises networks

174
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
and from cloud services that trusted

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
those stolen credentials

176
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
like microsoft's office 365.

177
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
now the second attack that i would like

178
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,440
to discuss began earlier this year

179
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
when a chinese actor group that we call

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
hafnium

181
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
used a previously unknown vulnerability

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
in exchange server

183
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
to conduct espionage on a small number

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
of networks around the world

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
once this was reported to us we began

186
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,520
our process

187
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
of of watching carefully what was

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
happening while we worked to engineer

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,639
patches

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,919
to protect our exchange server customers

191
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,000
and initially this was just a typical

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
espionage operation

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
with the actor quietly targeting just a

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
handful of victims around the

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
world but just before we issued our

196
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,759
patch to repair the vulnerability

197
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,319
there was a massive escalation in the

198
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,000
use of that vulnerability

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
by a significant number of chinese

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,039
actors

201
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
not just the original actor but others

202
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
as well that resulted in web shell

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,240
backdoors

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
being established in tens of thousands

205
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,000
of exchange servers

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
around the world curiously those

207
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
thousands of backdoors were only ever

208
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,160
used to view information in a very small

209
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
handful of networks

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
no other nation state used the

211
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,560
vulnerability to any significant extent

212
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
and despite worries by the private

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,759
sector and the u.s

214
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,160
government that ransomware syndicates

215
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
would use the vulnerability to engage in

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
widespread criminal activity

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,039
we saw only a very few instances of

218
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,919
ransomware exploits taking advantage of

219
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,680
this this vulnerability our researchers

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,919
ultimately discovered why

221
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
the vulnerability could only be

222
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
exploited to gain access

223
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
to an exchange server if the attacker

224
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,599
had the

225
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,840
email address of the exchange server

226
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,080
administrator at each target

227
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
now this was an important insight

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
because that's not

229
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
information that is generally public or

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,280
generally known

231
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,240
and as a result that made use of this

232
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
vulnerability

233
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,599
difficult and expensive and not

234
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,360
something that ransomware syndicates

235
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,039
were interested in

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
but the question that remains is how did

237
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
these chinese actors take advantage of

238
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,879
this vulnerability

239
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
there has been speculation that the

240
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,120
attackers must have had access

241
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,160
to an enormous database of information

242
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,799
about enterprises and organizations and

243
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,000
government offices

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,360
around the world that included the email

245
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
addresses of exchange

246
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,080
server administrators in order to

247
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,039
mobilize

248
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,600
such an escalated operation so quickly

249
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
so what are the key lessons that i think

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
we can derive from these two attacks and

251
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
that are important as we work

252
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,519
to improve cyber security and advance

253
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
digital peace

254
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,399
first sophistication this is not a new

255
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
lesson we've known for some time how

256
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,240
sophisticated nation-state attackers can

257
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,880
be

258
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
in both these cases clearly the

259
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
attackers were skilled

260
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
well-resourced and innovative they used

261
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,640
a very

262
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
novel approach to embed malware in a

263
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
software update

264
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
and they found and used a zero day

265
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
exploiting exchange server

266
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
and were able to use it for an escalated

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
campaign

268
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,880
even though its use was difficult and

269
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
challenging

270
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
second there's been some commentary that

271
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,839
these attacks

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,000
are not concerning and should not be

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,279
concerning to us because

274
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,279
they're just typical espionage not true

275
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
this was not espionage as usual

276
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
in both cases the attackers used

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
widespread

278
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
indiscriminate attacks on thousands

279
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
in order to actually spy on just a few

280
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,279
real targets this reckless approach

281
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
imposed widespread disruption

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
and economic harm third

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
the attacks employed new and troublesome

284
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,079
techniques

285
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,640
that threaten digital peace first the

286
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
russians again corrupted the software

287
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
update process

288
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
this is a process that all vendors

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
microsoft all of our competitors and all

290
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,959
of our partners in the ecosystem use

291
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,240
to keep customers secure it's critical

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
to the security of the digital ecosystem

293
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
that this process be trusted and used by

294
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,200
our customers

295
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
abusing it in this way will destroy that

296
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,480
trust and reduce

297
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
security the international community

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,279
should not countenance these kinds of

299
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,800
attacks

300
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
in the hafnium attack the chinese

301
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
apparently had access to and used

302
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
massive data sets to target enterprises

303
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,120
governments and organizations

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
indiscriminately

305
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
and without any apparent plan again

306
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
a new and challenging form finally

307
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,640
in both cases and despite widespread

308
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,519
consensus

309
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,920
about the source of these attacks we've

310
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,200
heard unabashed

311
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
denials of culpability by the

312
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,440
governments that are responsible

313
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
these denials are coupled with demands

314
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
for proof

315
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
that the attackers know will not be

316
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,000
forthcoming

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
they know that providing such evidence

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,200
would

319
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
necessarily reveal the sources and

320
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
methods necessary to track

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
and expose malign actors so we need the

322
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
international community

323
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,399
to work together we need governments to

324
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,279
come together

325
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
to collectively attribute these attacks

326
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,640
and impose

327
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
appropriate sanctions on nation states

328
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
that violate violate

329
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
accepted norms of conduct in cyberspace

330
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,320
thank you very much for the opportunity

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,079
to talk to you about these important

332
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,399
issues and if there's time i'd welcome

333
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
uh questions

334
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
thank you very much tom bert for these

335
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,720
scary insights

336
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,000
we're happy to have you here live so

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
now let's move on with our panel with
