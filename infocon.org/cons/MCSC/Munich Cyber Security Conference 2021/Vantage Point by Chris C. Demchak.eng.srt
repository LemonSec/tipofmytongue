1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
so welcome chris stamczak

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,080
i'm really very keen uh to listen to

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
your presentation and i

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,759
am sure that the audience is doing geta

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,880
thank you very much what i want to do is

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,800
you are now muted the uh follow on one

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,080
of the comments that was made in the

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,600
previous panel by um

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,400
sergei epp that we needed to focus on

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
the foundation

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
um i'm going to take that a step further

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
and make an argument that we can't just

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
focus we have to build on something and

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,079
i'm going to

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,760
make a point to you that today we need a

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,879
collective operational cyber defense

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,440
and that we can do it it is feasible and

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,239
it's urgent

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,440
and i will end with a suggestion on one

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,120
i'm working on called the cyber

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,840
operational resilience alliance

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
um i think we have to understand that

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
the world has changed and

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
cyber's insecurities is a phenomenal

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,760
contribution

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,239
to why the distribution of power and

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
influence in this world

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
moved away from us and we have to adapt

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
we know that cyber can have strategic

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,040
effects without

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
risking conflict we have to recognize

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,640
that we

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
built this extraordinarily insecure

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
substrate and we spread it everywhere

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
giving offense advantages

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,320
to everyone and changing the systemic

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
surprise in all of our own complex

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,119
systems

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,079
and authoritarian adversaries notably

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,720
china

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
have exploited it we created a new kind

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,159
of conflict

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,360
cyber conflict which is in part and

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,000
parcel

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
because we in the democracies have been

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,680
fragmented and delayed in the response

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
to these insecurities and now we've

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,600
created

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
great what i'm calling great systems

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,799
conflict

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,600
this is the rise of the peer states that

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
are actually

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,680
arguing and conflicting across

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
cyberspace using cyber means we're also

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,799
creating borders in cyberspace so we're

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
trying desperately to defend ourselves

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
as individual democracies and a better

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,599
way to define this is as jurisdictions

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,400
right and so as a consequence we need to

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
build something

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
across the democracies and organizations

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
here are critical not talking and i

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,040
argue

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and i will show you at the end of a

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,879
cyber operational

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,920
resilience alliance i call a quora

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
that needs to be built that includes our

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,480
private sector

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,760
and allows us to protect ourselves

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
in the near term as we build more

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,239
strongly in the long term

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,519
all right first off let's just get some

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
history done uh cyberspace at 2010 this

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
is the kind of picture i would have

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,160
shown you straight out of wikipedia

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,239
very clean very neat easy to see here's

77
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,319
2021 the same picture is covered with

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,760
clouds but they're not just

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
clouds they're commercial private clouds

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,280
in which

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
the programming itself is not obvious to

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
those of us who are looking at it on the

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
outside

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
another picture 2010 we would have

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
talked about the various stacks the

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,840
machine stack

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
the internet stack up here we would have

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,519
talked about the

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,640
autonomous systems of bgp today we have

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,560
to talk about a completely different

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
not completely different but a much more

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,239
complex set of stacks

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
that are virtual yes we have the

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
physical and digital infrastructure down

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
here but now we have cloud computing

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
owned largely by commercial firms and in

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
between are

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
virtualized virtualized items software

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
and then they go up to all the connected

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,159
devices that we have

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,440
and of course we have to care about

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
whether they're hybrid clouds

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
and artificial intelligence is changing

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
this as well as quantum

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
computing or computation in this case

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
another kind of stack we have to worry

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,239
about now is the

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,360
is what's called the artificial

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
intelligence stack it has different

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
things in there massive data management

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
decision supports but machine learning

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,879
and all the

113
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,080
forms of different kinds of of

114
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
computation that before were buried or

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
in research

116
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
before in 2010 we would talk about these

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
lovely

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,399
cable networks and still 98 of the

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,358
global internet

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,160
runs through these networks but at that

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
time it was pretty easy to follow them

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,240
now

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
oops now this is what it looks like

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,639
now it's complex everyone is building up

125
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
google is building their own

126
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
we have a different world where it's

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
moving away from the hands of the

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,759
democracies and what are the democracies

129
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,240
doing

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
well they're doing what the adversaries

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
are doing we're creating jurisdictions

132
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,520
we are trying to make ourselves

133
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,479
individually defensible and defended

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,919
and part of the reason we're doing that

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,840
is we have been losing one to two

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
percent of our gdp

137
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
annually to cyber insecurity that's not

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
sustainable

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
by the way so what's happening

140
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
the future is coming very very fast

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,440
a lot has been said about the china belt

142
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
and road

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
program but now we have the china of

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,919
course the digital belt and road and

145
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,520
we're seeing them

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,720
throughout the world the chinese scale

147
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
allows them to be in places

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,039
that they couldn't have been before

149
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,840
right

150
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
and that scale allows them to change the

151
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
world

152
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
whether we want him to do it or not

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
there's another picture this comes out

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
of the uh some australian researchers

155
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,120
the seven major firms of china

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
and what they're involved in all over

157
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
the world so whether you

158
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
want them to do something or not they

159
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
have the means to be at the bottom of

160
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,160
that stack

161
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
and change the world around you and

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
these are the kinds of things they're

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
involved in

164
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,479
smart city surveillance and all sorts of

165
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,440
data centers particularly data centers

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,160
cables all sorts of and they're

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,560
positioning on a lot of cables

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
satellite calibration centers their

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
chinese version of gps

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
baidu is of course um now present

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
throughout the world and curiously

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,919
enough the satellite likes to

173
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
geoposition above

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
the capitals of other countries

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
their westernized influence that we used

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,240
to have

177
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
is declining as they spread out in 2006

178
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,759
only one firm amongst the largest

179
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,919
telecommunications firms of chinese

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,120
by 14 2014 four of the seven were

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
chinese

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
2020 huawei is clearly the largest

183
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
telecommunication vendor globally and

184
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,479
chinese firms

185
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,080
are beginning looks you might might say

186
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,919
they're beginning to own a continent

187
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,039
africa where huawei's built at least 70

188
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
4g networks and it's holding them

189
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,080
hostage for a high

190
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,840
for 5g and china mobile is absolutely

191
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
dominant

192
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,759
now we know that the chinese government

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
has actually decided now it's time for

194
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
them to have a new internet

195
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
not one that enables a free and open

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
internet but one where you have to

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,039
register to use it and you can be shut

198
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,919
off

199
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,639
and still we're not listening this is a

200
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,199
wonderful

201
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,720
um headline from cnet you know china has

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
big ideas for the internet but

203
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,720
too bad nobody likes them well who

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
exactly is no one

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,479
all of africa the middle east good part

206
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,199
of asia

207
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
they seem to like it just fine a couple

208
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
of years ago a colleague and i duval

209
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,599
chavit from university of tel aviv we

210
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
did some research on bgp hijacking

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
use through china telecom very nice

212
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
at that time china had china telecom had

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,000
10 points of presence inside united

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,039
north america now they have

215
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,680
over 2 500 points of presence throughout

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
the world this kind of behavior

217
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,599
is absolutely possible anywhere that

218
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,919
they're present so whose preferences

219
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
will actually dominate

220
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
this future cyber world that we're

221
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,240
talking about whose preferences

222
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
will dominate its governance and the

223
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
control in each of these layers

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,639
will it be us no will we be able to

225
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,599
control who's

226
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,240
who is doing it well one thing we have

227
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,280
to look at

228
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,639
is the fact that we may not even have

229
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,319
the funds to compete

230
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,479
if we do not combine our funds in some

231
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,680
way and

232
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
we anticipated that chinese economy

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
would equal the u.s economy by 2030

234
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
maybe somewhere around then it's a good

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
argument to be made that in 2014 it

236
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,919
already equaled the u.s economy

237
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,280
by using gdp ppp measures and by

238
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,639
2019 it was already 20 larger and this

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,000
was before the losses of coronavirus

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
so we have to adapt to this reality and

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,679
in this reality the

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,159
chinese scale and coherence is

243
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,839
absolutely going to defeat

244
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,320
any single one of the democracies that

245
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,120
you live in

246
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
or you like we are in the world terms a

247
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
minority community

248
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,640
we have preferences and the rest of the

249
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
world is not sharing them

250
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
so we need to think about what future we

251
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
want do we want the future we're going

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
to have if we do nothing

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
do we want the future that we're going

254
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
to have if each of us makes our own

255
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
jurisdictions in cyberspace and

256
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
desperately tries to defend

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,720
but i call it the difference between

258
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
rising vessel them and some more slowly

259
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
rising vessel them

260
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,399
we can't go back to where we were we'll

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
never have that ability

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,000
but what we can do is we can make our

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
systemically across our community we can

264
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
make the strategic coherence

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
and achieve the scale necessary to

266
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,640
resist

267
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,839
and actually provide an alternative

268
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,080
model

269
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
so what we need is a new narrative we

270
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,360
have to recognize we're a minority

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
community and we have three

272
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,360
operational goals not talk talk talk but

273
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
operational goals

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
the first one is that we scale up and we

275
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
have the people to do that we have at

276
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
least a billion people

277
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
that we can bring into this and we bring

278
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
in our private sector

279
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
and this becomes our democratic i.t

280
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,320
thank you sandro for that title

281
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
that becomes our community our

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
democratic i.t

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,079
and we buy time immediately we start

284
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,000
collectively defending

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
of course it's sharing information but

286
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,760
with our private sector

287
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
inside the tent now what does the

288
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
private sector get from this

289
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
you do not have to inside the tent you

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
don't have to compete head head-to-head

291
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,959
with the huawei's of the world

292
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
you can compete internationally as you

293
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
like you can export internationally as

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,160
you like

295
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,560
huawei cannot own parts of that stack

296
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,240
inside the tent and finally and not

297
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,800
it absolutely not the least item the

298
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
most important item

299
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
is on a wartime level of investment we

300
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
have to transform the underlying

301
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
substrate

302
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,399
the underlying very shoddy cyberspace we

303
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,240
began with and on which

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,640
all of your artificial intelligence and

305
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
everything else is going to rest

306
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
we have to transform it into what we

307
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
meant it to be

308
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,640
so we need the kind of r d across

309
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
universities labs

310
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
and firms to change it into that

311
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
securable

312
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
substrate we meant for it to be and only

313
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,200
then

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
can we turn to the rest of the world and

315
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
say democracy

316
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,040
can be prosperous vigorous and united

317
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,760
and provide an alternative counter story

318
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,839
to the china model

319
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,680
now at the moment i'm working on a piece

320
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,399
of research i know there are many ideas

321
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,200
about how we correlate how we can come

322
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,760
together

323
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
collectively but i'm working a model

324
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,440
that was built

325
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
on the uh the five

326
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
offense advantages that we originally

327
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
gave to the world and caused the problem

328
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,440
from the start

329
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,079
with the shoddy cyberspace and this is

330
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,079
the cyborg conflict model

331
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,160
and what i'm working on right now is a

332
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
cyber operational resilience

333
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,200
alliance that is inserted into the model

334
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,519
and it begins to break these connections

335
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,399
for us

336
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,160
right and i'm happy to talk about that

337
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
if you'd like to

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,959
but in the meantime let me come to the

339
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
end this is our reality

340
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
there's no assured future for us in this

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,079
deeply cyber authoritarian

342
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,519
world of great systems conflict unless

343
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
we hang together

344
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,760
and as franklin said if we don't hang

345
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,880
together

346
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
across allies and even internally we

347
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
will most certainly

348
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
hang separately okay

349
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
and thank you very much i'm open to any

350
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,800
questions

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
thank you so much chris for this very

352
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
inspiring presentation that provided us

353
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
with a lot of food for thought

354
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
um maybe one quick question uh back to

355
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,160
you

356
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
as uh um you recently warned against

357
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,680
uh um a split of the u.s cyber command

358
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,079
from the msa that you want that would

359
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,160
create silos and is not a good idea can

360
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,040
you

361
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,079
briefly tell us why it isn't a good idea

362
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
why silos are not a good idea this is

363
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
the question

364
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,839
exactly

365
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,079
because we have the same situation

366
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,399
try to imagine why silos would be a good

367
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,120
idea

368
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
uh uh under under these circumstances um

369
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
if i understand are you talking about

370
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
silos within the community of

371
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,399
democracies

372
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
because i fundamentally we share more

373
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
in terms of values in terms of the rule

374
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,000
of law in terms of our expectations

375
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
then we do not share and and

376
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
we are a minority community i mean if

377
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,560
you look across the world

378
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
we spent 70 years telling ourselves we

379
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,560
ran the rest of the world and we did not

380
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
turn them into consolidated democracies

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
we we are bizarrely suey generous

382
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
and we share values that are markedly

383
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
different than the rest of the world it

384
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
makes us

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,800
hard to you know easy to kill and hard

386
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
to defend sometimes

387
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,880
so silos when you have a silo

388
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
operationally hey

389
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,279
thank you so much chris and that was a

390
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,160
statement

391
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,360
uh silos are really still a problem in

392
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
the cyber security world and

393
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
chris stamchak's vantage point is the

394
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,079
perfect connecting passage in terms of

395
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
how scale can defeat a scale in terms of

396
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
cyber security and cyber attacks and new

397
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,040
technologies

398
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
will play an increasingly important role

399
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
in the future

400
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:41,040
to achieve this goal
