1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,520
so now our keynote speaker today is

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,759
height schmidt

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,919
secretary-general of the ocsc

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,679
she has held several prominent

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
diplomatic positions during her career

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
let me just mention two of them

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
she was secretary general for the

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,359
european external action service

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
and the deputy secretary general for

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,359
political affairs

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,560
for the european external action service

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
please welcome here helga schmidt

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
excellencies dear participants

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
they say only a crisis produces change

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
but is the kovit 19 pandemic a watershed

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,520
moment for cybersecurity

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
surely the digitalization of our world

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,280
was well

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
underway and accelerating even before

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,640
the pandemic

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
yet i think no one will doubt

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,160
that the pandemic has forced us to

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,000
embrace technology

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
and with it its inherent risks at even

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,640
greater speed our fast increasing

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,799
reliance on cyberspace

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,960
also raises the stakes and the

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,080
likelihood

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,040
of a cyber incident destabilizing the

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
already delicate relations

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
between states in the field of cyber

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,759
diplomacy

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,560
the pandemic has revealed that not

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,439
everything

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,960
can be digitized least of all in-person

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
engagement

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
in confidence and trust building

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
but with more and more professional

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
political

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
and diplomatic activities migrating

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
to the digital sphere the organization

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
for security and cooperation in europe

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
or the oece for short has adapted

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
to promoting stability peace and

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
democracy

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
in an increasingly online world

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,600
with 57 participating states in north

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,640
america

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,159
europe and asia the osce is the world's

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
largest regional security organization

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
using political dialogue and practical

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,760
work

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
to ensure the comprehensive security of

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
over one

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
billion people our approach to security

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,239
encompasses

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
political military economic

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,000
environmental

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
and human dimensions

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
recently the oec contributed to the work

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,760
of the united nations open-ended working

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,280
group

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
which as you know issued its final

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
report in march this year

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
encouragingly the report highlighted the

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,879
important role

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,680
of regional organizations including the

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
osce

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
in contributing to cyber stability

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,800
so you might now wonder what is exactly

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
the oec doing in this field

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
and why is this contribution so

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
important

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
in the past decade the oec has served as

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
an incubator

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,000
of un recommendations and a pioneer

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
in adopting regional cyber security

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,319
confidence building measures these

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,680
confidence billing measures

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
represent a crucial pillar of the global

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
cyber stability framework and are aimed

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
at promoting cooperation

83
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,360
reducing misperceptions and helping

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,879
prevent escalation

85
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
that may lead to conflict

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
confidence-building measures

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,040
may not prevent a deliberate cyber

88
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
incident

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
but they can create an atmosphere of

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,360
trust

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
and confidence where one is much less

92
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
likely to occur

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,599
to date oec participating states have

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,319
adopted

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,879
16 confidence building measures that

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,599
create

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,319
and increase transparency enhance

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,439
cooperation

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,480
and foster greater preparedness also by

100
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,040
evolving

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,120
involving many different stakeholders

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
what do these look like and how

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,599
do they work in practice

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
let's assume that our participating

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
state has become aware

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,798
of a cyber incident on its own territory

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,960
that might involve critical

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
infrastructure

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
or governmental systems with the

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
available information

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
it might be difficult to have certainty

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,440
about the intent and even the identity

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
of the attackers so instead of drawing

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
conclusions

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
based on incomplete information which

116
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,639
could lead to

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
increasing tensions and escalations the

118
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
concerned participating state

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
can reach out to the authorities of the

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
country it suspects the attack has

121
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
originated from

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
and exchange information to have a full

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
picture

124
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,280
so recognizing the need for rapid

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,919
notifications

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,560
and crisis communication oic

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
participating states have

128
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,880
created a network of national points of

129
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
contact

130
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,199
including both policy makers and

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
technical experts i'm aware that this

132
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
might just sound like having a few names

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,759
and contact details

134
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
in a virtual phone book but this is not

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
the case

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
thanks to conscious efforts by our

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,520
participating states

138
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
and with the support of the oc

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
secretariat

140
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,919
the network is a living community of

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,199
policy makers

142
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,919
that work together to promote cyber

143
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
stability

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
the opportunity to meet in person and

145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
exchange best practices

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
can create valuable partnerships between

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
states

148
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
not always having previously engaged

149
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,680
with each other

150
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,400
as you can imagine the information

151
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,919
shared in these cases

152
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,240
might be of a particularly sensitive

153
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,919
nature

154
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,639
so having a secure channel is critical

155
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,600
to ensure

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
that information is transmitted securely

157
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
and its authenticity preserved

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,759
can usc provide a secure channel for all

159
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
of our 57 participating states

160
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
as an organization that specializes in

161
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
confidence building measures

162
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,280
we were able to take advantage of the

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,880
already existing

164
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,199
communications network that allows

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,440
participating states to exchange

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,639
secure notifications and has so far

167
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
mainly been used in the context of arms

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,600
control

169
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
these are just a few tangible examples

170
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,919
of the dynamic unproductive discussions

171
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,280
that are taking place

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
through the confidence billing measures

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
process

174
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
states are further using the oec as a

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,560
platform

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
to conceptualize exchange and adopt best

177
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
practices

178
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
on topics such as critical

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
infrastructure

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,479
protection and public private

181
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,120
partnerships

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
to further demystify confidence building

183
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,039
measures

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,560
and present the status of their progress

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
the oec recently launched a publicly

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
available e-learning course

187
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,199
that i warmly recommend to the audience

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
beyond the osce framework also

189
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,120
confidence billing measures are

190
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,639
gradually finding

191
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,440
more applications and then ever bigger

192
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
audience

193
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
other regional organizations are

194
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
building confidence

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
and cooperation among its members

196
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
in fact both the organization of

197
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,160
american states

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,639
and the asean regional forum have

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,840
followed suit

200
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
in adopting their own sets of

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,319
confidence-building measures

202
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
recognizing this the united nations has

203
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,080
encouraged

204
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,879
further cross-regional exchanges and has

205
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
also been calling for formalizing

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,440
dialogue

207
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
between regional organizations on these

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
issues

209
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
in june this year the osce will be

210
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,680
co-organizing its third bi-annual

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
inter-regional conference on cyber ict

212
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
security

213
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,199
with the republic of korea through this

214
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,319
conference

215
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,639
and other frequent international

216
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,840
exchanges

217
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
the oec stands ready to share its

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,440
experiences

219
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,760
and help link diverse regional efforts

220
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
ladies and gentlemen challenges in

221
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,958
cyberspace

222
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,440
are global in nature and regional

223
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,000
efforts

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,519
must mirror this fact the oec will

past current and future un processes

228
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
in turn we will share our own lessons

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,440
learned

230
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
from our set of confidence billing

231
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
measures that we are deploying

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
to improve security in cyberspace

233
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,399
