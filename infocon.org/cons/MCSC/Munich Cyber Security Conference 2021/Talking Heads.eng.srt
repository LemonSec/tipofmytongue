1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,840
well thanks so much for having me

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,600
um my name is gregor peter schmitz i

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,359
will be hosting this panel i have hosted

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,160
it a few times

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
last i never realized that it's really

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
called talking at the section

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,759
which is fitting because it's one of my

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
favorite bands and one of the favorite

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,680
albums is called stop making sense

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
we're gonna try to do the very opposite

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
now trying to make sense here on this

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,480
panel

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
uh when it comes to um the very much

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,080
changing environment of it security and

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,560
i'm

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,640
pretty sure we we're gonna make sense

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,399
because we have assembled

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,480
a stellar cast of characters again on

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,920
this panel some of them have been

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
stalwarts of this conference for a

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,800
number of years

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
and don't really need an introduction

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,239
but i'm gonna introduce them

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,000
nevertheless very briefly

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
we have alex stammers here who has been

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
with us a number of times

27
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,039
over the years um uh he just told us

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,520
that he

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,239
would love to come to munich in february

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,840
so maybe next year will be possible

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,719
again

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,559
he is now with stanford he has been a

33
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
chief security officer both at facebook

34
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,760
at yahoo

35
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,119
uh he's spoken on six continents um uh

36
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
holds five patents so what else is there

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,720
to say

38
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
but what i like about him in his buyer

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
is that always referred to

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
as the forrest gump of infosec by

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,000
friends so

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
that is uh i think a title that everyone

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,080
should aspire to

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
um i'm not sure that thomas turkey is

45
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
going to be

46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,119
called the forrest gump of deutsche

47
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
telekom i hope not but he's definitely

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
the go-to guy

49
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
or i.t security at deutsche telekom

50
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,920
where he has been working

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,479
for a number of years and he's in charge

52
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,479
of everything related to

53
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,960
i.t securities here so welcome thomas

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,920
and we have

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,759
uh bruce schneier who also doesn't need

56
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
an instruction he's with the kennedy

57
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,079
school

58
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,479
of government my alma mater so hi to

59
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
cambridge he's actually flying back to

60
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,600
cambridge i think for the first

61
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,159
time this weekend he hasn't been there

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
in a long time and he just uh

63
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,840
told me that i shouldn't worry about it

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
because harvard has more money

65
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
got even in the corona crisis so

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,360
uh hi bruce uh he has written a number

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,079
of books

68
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,479
i think the most outstanding one or the

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,520
most stunning one

70
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
is still the one with the title click

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
here to kill everybody

72
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
and how is this panel going to work are

73
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
we going to have a very brief

74
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,480
introduction or opening remarks by bruce

75
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,319
he doesn't share his presentation

76
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
because he just told us that

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
no one wants to see powerpoint now on

78
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,879
zoom

79
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
uh so it's gonna be a very brief uh chat

80
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,120
basically at the beginning then we're

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,519
gonna

82
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,040
discuss here for 20 minutes on the panel

83
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,560
and then we want to open it up to

84
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,599
questions

85
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,519
you can write the questions to the

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,800
moderator

87
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,959
or to the editors please remember that a

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
question has a question mark and

89
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,599
shouldn't be a statement even when we

90
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
are online

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
um and now it's the floor is yours bros

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
i'm looking forward to your presentation

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
uh thank you so alex i think you and i

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,519
should host a conference on an

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,200
antarctic cruise ship so we can have

96
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,519
spoken on seven continents that really

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,640
seems like

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
a good idea i don't know if the penguins

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
want to hear we have to say but

100
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
i don't know maybe they'll listen more

101
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
than uh other people we speak to

102
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,720
i actually want to make three points

103
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
actually first i want to say

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,760
that it's really nice to be with

105
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
everybody and i truly wish we could

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
be together in person and hope that next

107
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,799
year we are

108
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
again having having conferences i'm

109
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
jealous of the australians

110
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,519
who have uh licked krokovic so well that

111
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,879
they are having in-person

112
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,360
conferences uh so i want to make three

113
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,879
points about about security i think it's

114
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
really relevant right now

115
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,120
uh the first is that uh that patching is

116
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
is failing as a security paradigm

117
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,519
i mean patching is how we get security

118
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,560
the reason

119
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,480
you know this object our phones and our

120
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,720
computers are secure as they are

121
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
for two reasons is a team of engineers

122
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
at apple and microsoft and google

123
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
designing to be secure and those same

124
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
engineers are available to quickly

125
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
and effectively push security patches

126
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,000
down

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
to our phones and computers when a new

128
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
vulnerability exploit is discovered that

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
ecosystem doesn't work

130
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,720
for modern low-cost embedded systems

131
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,360
like home routers or dvrs

132
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,798
they're built at a much lower profit

133
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,399
margin offshore

134
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
they don't have dedicated security teams

135
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,079
associated with them

136
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
and a lot of them can't be patched i

137
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,360
mean right now the way you patch your

138
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
home router

139
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
is you throw it away and buy a new one

140
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
that's the patch mechanism

141
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
but you know that actually does does

142
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
work the the life cycle of our phones

143
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
and computers is what you know three

144
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,400
years

145
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
that also isn't true for low-cost

146
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,680
embedded systems

147
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,360
you're going to replace your i don't

148
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
know dvr every five to ten years

149
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,520
your refrigerator every 25 years yeah i

150
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
mean i bought a new thermostat

151
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,840
two years ago i expect to replace it

152
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
never

153
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,759
and and that is a security issue and if

154
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,560
you think about it you buy a car today

155
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,039
uh

156
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,479
so let's make it up the software is two

157
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,960
years old you buy it drive for 10 years

158
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
sell it someone else buys it they drive

159
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
for 10 years

160
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
they sell it probably at this point it

161
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
gets put in a boat sent to africa or

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
latin america

163
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
where someone else buys it drives

164
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
another 10 to 20 years

165
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,840
right so you try to find a computer from

166
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
1979. try to boot it up try to make it

167
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,960
work we have no

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,600
idea how to maintain 40 year old

169
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,199
consumer software

170
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,199
there's a reason apple microsoft

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,479
depreciate operating systems

172
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,360
so this notion of patching which is

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
really the mainstay of security right

174
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,919
now

175
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,320
is going to start failing as all of

176
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,160
these non-computer devices come online

177
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
second thing i see failing is

178
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,160
authentication an authentication

179
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
kind of only just barely ever worked

180
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,319
my human memorizable passwords just

181
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:58,880
aren't

182
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
good in any a lot of situations

183
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
two-factor is great but it it

184
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
it doesn't work in a bunch of places and

185
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
people don't like it

186
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,479
backup authentication systems are

187
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
terrible

188
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
but the amount of authenticating we're

189
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
gonna do is gonna explode exponentially

190
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
normally authenticating is one of two

191
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,759
things i'm gonna demonstrate them all

192
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,440
right i logged into my phone with my

193
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,479
face

194
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
and i just checked my email i logged

195
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,520
into a remote

196
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
service and that worked so i did it

197
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,880
really easy

198
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
but we're gonna start seeing the rise of

199
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
thing-to-thing authentication

200
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
internet of things 5g is not about you

201
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,759
watching netflix faster

202
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,440
it's about things talking to things

203
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
behind your back

204
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
and whether it's sensors or actuators

205
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
anything in your orbit we're going to

206
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
have to authenticate them

207
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
to each other and we don't know how to

208
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
do that at scale

209
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,639
you know we could do that a little bit

210
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,120
bluetooth works right i go into my car

211
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
this automatically authenticates

212
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
but i was there to set it up manually

213
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,120
and that's not going to work for

214
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,840
hundreds or thousands or millions of

215
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,880
things

216
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,800
the third thing that's failing is supply

217
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
chain which honestly is an

218
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,840
insurmountably

219
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,199
hard problem in in the past few years

220
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,240
we've been talking about

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
uh huawei why should we trust chinese

222
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
networking equipment

223
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
a few years before that it was kaspersky

224
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
should we trust russian anti-virus

225
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
equipment

226
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
and this is an important security

227
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,479
question right should can you trust

228
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,520
technology

229
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,199
built in a country whose government you

230
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,560
don't trust

231
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
but that is just the beginning of a very

232
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,759
large problem

233
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
right this is a u.s product but it's not

234
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,840
made in the u.s its chips aren't fat

235
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,240
in the u.s its programmers carry 100

236
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
different passports

237
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,319
and we have discovered backdoors and

238
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
juniper firewalls d-link routers

239
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
uh we there have been back doors that

240
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
attempted to be put in all sorts of uh

241
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
public domain systems on on github

242
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
and there's a lot well you have to trust

243
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
the development process

244
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
the distribution mechanism fake zap the

245
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
google fake apps the google play store

246
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
the update mechanism right not petya

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
solar winds

248
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,479
the shipping mechanism right the nsa

249
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
stuck a back door into a cisco router

250
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
testing the syrian telephone company in

251
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,319
the snowden archives we have photographs

252
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
and this is a really hard problem

253
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,479
now you could imagine a us-only iphone

254
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
it'll cost 10 times as much no we'll buy

255
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,039
it

256
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
that we are a deeply deeply

257
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
interconnected international industry

258
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,759
and you have to trust every aspect of

259
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,880
the supply chain

260
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
and can't trust any of them and we

261
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
really don't have a good answer to this

262
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,159
and this is now increasingly an attack

263
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,719
vector

264
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
that governments and criminals are using

265
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
so that's what i want to start with and

266
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,200
i'd love to get into into more uh

267
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
the conversation

268
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,920
well thanks so much bruce picking up on

269
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,720
that um

270
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,279
a question to you alex and also thomas

271
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,320
um

272
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
do you think um when we look at soris

273
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
what has changed because of the pandemic

274
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,279
now

275
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
maybe if you want to start alex sure

276
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,200
so um one of the things that pandemic

277
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,279
has done is it's massively accelerated a

278
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
couple of trends that we had

279
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,800
in enterprise i.t um one was flexibility

280
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,399
around people's work conditions right so

281
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,959
we've

282
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,279
there's been this idea that has been

283
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
embraced

284
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
by a lot of companies actually

285
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
implemented correctly by a smaller

286
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
number of this idea of zero trust

287
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,800
networks

288
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
that you could build your corporate

289
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,120
networks in a way that being at home

290
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
being in a coffee shop being in the

291
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
office are all the same thing from a

292
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
technical perspective

293
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,560
that you don't get any special access

294
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
from being physically in the office

295
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
and that you don't lose any access or

296
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,839
telemetry or security benefits from

297
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,440
being out of the office

298
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
the reality is like well a lot of people

299
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,080
have talked about zero trust networking

300
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,519
the reality is there's only a handful of

301
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,880
companies that really implemented it

302
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,920
before covid

303
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
and effectively over a three month

304
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,959
period last year

305
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,160
a huge number of companies had to had to

306
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
deploy the same kind of ideas without

307
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,120
having a plan and without having

308
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
the months or years necessary to

309
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
architect how to do so in a way that's

310
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
non-disruptive

311
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
and so we've seen this massive change in

312
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,640
the way that systems are managed

313
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,519
remotely

314
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,680
and a lot of cases people do not have

315
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
companies don't have

316
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
the kind of telemetry they used to have

317
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
um so in some cases people have been

318
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
effective uh in saying that you know the

319
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
same kind of security

320
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
uh protections are in place but in most

321
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
cases not and that's because the kind of

322
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,800
traditional security products that we've

323
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,360
bought the

324
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
the pizza boxes that we put into a

325
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,519
closet in a a wiring closet in an office

326
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,279
that allow us to get telemetry across

327
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,480
the entire network allow us to do

328
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
netflow access

329
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
or network recording or dns aggregation

330
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,240
those kinds of things don't work anymore

331
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
and there are other things you can do to

332
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,480
try to

333
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,079
get the same kind of security controls

334
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,279
and in some cases they've been deployed

335
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,800
in some cases not which has created a

336
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
very complicated situation for

337
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
enterprise i.t

338
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
you mentioned earlier when we talked

339
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,320
that you are even consulting backside

340
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,800
makers like astro seneca so what are

341
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
they particularly concerned about when

342
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,600
it comes to i.t security

343
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
yeah so i mean i can't talk about any

344
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
specific clients but there are a number

345
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,240
of companies including vaccine makers

346
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,920
and such who are now bigger targets and

347
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,480
i think

348
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
you know what we've seen over the last

349
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,920
six months um

350
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,360
is uh a um

351
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
a demonstration of the fact that

352
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,959
the the line that used to exist that

353
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,160
above this line

354
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
you had to be worried about really

355
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,680
high-end attackers who have months or

356
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
years to break into your company

357
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
no longer exists right so like 20 years

358
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,720
ago

359
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,160
the only people who had to worry about a

360
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,000
professional intelligence team that was

361
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
dedicated to attacking them

362
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
was the defense industrial base right

363
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
the the northrop grummans the bae

364
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,399
systems and the like

365
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
um and then you had oil and gas you had

366
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,639
telecom you had big banks

367
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,440
you had big tech in the late 2000s early

368
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
20 teens

369
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
and what's happened over the last

370
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
several years is that a number of groups

371
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
have demonstrated the value of breaking

372
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,920
in

373
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
to a very broad swath of companies um

374
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,839
and that's what we've learned

375
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,760
through both the svr attacks including

376
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
solar winds

377
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
as well as the attacks against 86 000

378
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
exchange servers

379
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,639
uh by a chinese group is that that line

380
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,000
has effectively disappeared and we're

381
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
now in a place where

382
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,839
a very broad swath of industry needs to

383
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,800
be prepared to

384
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
play against a level of adversary that

385
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,639
again was only faced by kind of defense

386
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,440
companies 10 years ago thomas what was

387
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
your experience like at deutsche

388
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
telegram would you share alex's

389
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
assessment

390
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
yeah i i share what alex and blue said

391
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,040
before and

392
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
for me some call it pandemia yeah i call

393
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,639
it the biggest

394
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
digitization project on the planet we

395
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
ever had

396
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
in the history and this shows me

397
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,160
that we're running into a lot of

398
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,320
problems especially in cases where

399
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,279
people are

400
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,279
naively connecting their stuff to the

401
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,720
internet and

402
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
this happened a lot just because of the

403
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,720
need

404
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
to be able to work from abroad or to

405
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
work from remote out of the home office

406
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,639
and and people who are running lazy with

407
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,000
their id

408
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
are more in danger than ever before so

409
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
we see a new really

410
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,519
peak of all the ransomware attacks i

411
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,040
have a lot of clients

412
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
who got their whole infrastructure

413
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
encrypted

414
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,800
the last couple of months so this is

415
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
really a growing trend

416
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,720
and at the other side and this was was

417
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
really a major point uh bruce met

418
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,240
before we also

419
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
see now how vulnerable are our supply

420
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,839
chains

421
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,480
and it's not only because of the supply

422
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
chain attacks it's also because of the

423
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,240
dependency of several regions of the

424
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,040
world

425
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
what we experience is when there is a

426
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
shutdown because of an pandemia

427
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
in a certain region in the world we

428
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,320
directly see the impact

429
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,800
four weeks later in europe for instance

430
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
as we we don't get

431
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
any more supply we're now running into a

432
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,480
chip crisis

433
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
it was driven by by different factors

434
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
but it was driven by

435
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
the the economic war between the us and

436
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,519
china

437
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,760
it's driven by the covet crisis and now

438
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
it comes all together

439
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,040
and so the world is now really showing

440
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
how complex

441
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
we became over time and the the good

442
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
question is how to deal with that in

443
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,480
future and how to solve that and how to

444
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,680
find solutions

445
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
especially like uh the example of bruce

446
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,240
yeah i'm always using the example

447
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
in in my speeches um how to pet your

448
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,360
fridge it might not be enough just to

449
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,920
put a

450
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
cd in the deep fridge part um so so we

451
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
need to find solutions

452
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,000
um for that and this this shows the

453
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,639
whole

454
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,120
dramaturgy of the situation we are in

455
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,639
yeah so we have

456
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
lost control over the existing

457
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
infrastructures we have lost control

458
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,480
um about um the supply chain so

459
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
where's the way out yes so

460
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
if you if you listen to um thomas saying

461
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
that is the biggest

462
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
digitalization project in history is

463
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
your what does it take is the glass

464
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
half full or health empty i mean are we

465
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,120
making progress in controlling cyber

466
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
risks or are we falling further behind

467
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
you know i mean both are true i mean

468
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,199
every year uh

469
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
we get better technologies better ideas

470
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,639
better security but

471
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,360
every year the threat also gets worse

472
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,760
and

473
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,480
uh i mean alex makes a really good point

474
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,519
in

475
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
you know i don't know a a mid-level

476
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
power company in the middle of ohio

477
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
against the russian government just

478
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,639
isn't a fair fight

479
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
and and now we're expecting that

480
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,639
you know that level of threat and at the

481
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
same time i think it's coming

482
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,440
more connected more digitized uh

483
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
into a lower price point right your

484
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,600
fridges and and toys are not secured at

485
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,639
the same level

486
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,440
as computers so things are just getting

487
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
much more

488
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
complicated and and risk is going up

489
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,320
the the nation-state actors are getting

490
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
more aggressive

491
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
china russia iran north korea and you

492
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,360
know and and the list is growing

493
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
so i think this is really becoming a

494
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,920
national security issue

495
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
in a way it didn't now we really now

496
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,600
have to worry about

497
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,320
interconnected toys taking down critical

498
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,519
infrastructure

499
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,160
and that's really hard for policy yeah

500
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
and what is your impression

501
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,000
maybe a question to both of you when you

502
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
talk to political

503
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,920
uh actors i mean do you get the

504
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,680
impression that they understand the

505
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,959
seriousness of this

506
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,759
uh challenge that they even have uh the

507
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
resources intellectual resources to

508
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
grapple with these issues or what is

509
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,240
what is your take when you talk to

510
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,079
people in washington or brussels or

511
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,040
berlin

512
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,759
i mean no at least i mean in the u.s no

513
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,519
this is too technical and we're still

514
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,240
running our our tech policy for the

515
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,759
short-term financial interests of a

516
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
bunch of billionaires i mean it's a

517
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,800
really stupid way to run society

518
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,279
but it's what we do you know we're not

519
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,040
looking at broader issues

520
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
what is your take alex

521
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,880
yeah i i think um

522
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
so things have gone a little bit better

523
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,480
uh with the new administration and that

524
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,880
they're

525
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
you know under the trump administration

526
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
we effectively had pretty much nobody

527
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,679
working on cyber from a coordination

528
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,039
perspective at the white house

529
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
there are a lot of good people at

530
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
various agencies

531
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,079
who are trying to do work but there is

532
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,079
very little leadership we've now kind of

533
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,919
gone completely the opposite direction

534
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
where we've gone from nobody doing cyber

535
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
to everybody doing cyber uh

536
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
in the in the government and so we now

537
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,559
have uh a deputy

538
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,960
uh national security advisor for cyber

539
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
and neuberger

540
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
we have a new position a national cyber

541
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
coordinator that's gonna be a guy named

542
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
chris inglis

543
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
um we're gonna have a director of sis uh

544
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
deputy director of cisa you know that

545
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
the secretary of homeland security is

546
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,840
very interested in cyber so there's

547
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
actually now a lot of people

548
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
who are getting their hands in the

549
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
policy bucket and and we do have some

550
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,840
movement there is going to be

551
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
an executive order that comes into the

552
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
white house maybe next week maybe a

553
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
couple weeks from now

554
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
which is going to directly address

555
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,919
supply chain issues for

556
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
companies that that sell into the

557
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
federal government um as well as to

558
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
start down the path

559
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
of something that people like bruce and

560
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,880
i have been talking about for a long

561
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,360
time

562
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
which is the idea of an agency that

563
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
investigates

564
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,919
these kinds of breaches and helps

565
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,520
educate people of what went wrong that's

566
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,160
something

567
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
a problem that we have around the world

568
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,919
which is these breaches happen and

569
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,520
there's nobody's job

570
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,320
to to come up with what the society

571
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,520
level fixes are

572
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,919
we do that for airplane crashes right we

573
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
have it for a bunch of other for what uh

574
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
when our train

575
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,200
derails uh you know um when we have a

576
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
boat gets stuck in a canal

577
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
like there's there's root cause analysis

578
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
but there isn't on cyber um

579
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
and uh that there at least is some

580
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
movement in in washington

581
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,559
from the white house from our congress

582
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,679
there has been nothing

583
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,760
useful yet but when you talk about

584
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
educating people do you think virtually

585
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,640
academia to come up with solutions and

586
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,840
with regards to the future of cyber

587
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,039
security good bruce

588
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,280
i mean it's less tech solutions and more

589
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,240
policy solutions

590
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
we have a lot of tech and the problem is

591
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
the there and we don't have the economic

592
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
incentives

593
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,880
for companies to use it so i'm less

594
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
worried about tech and i'm much worried

595
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,280
about policy

596
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,000
i need the economic incentives to change

597
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
which is changing policy

598
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
so may i jump in here so so i don't

599
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,160
think we

600
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,039
of course policy here in that space what

601
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
we really need is more collaboration

602
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
yeah i would say even if the situation

603
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,120
is

604
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
is really worth at the moment uh

605
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
the glass is still half full and not

606
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,679
half empty

607
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,120
um but look making an easy example

608
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,480
when you you do as a company buy some

609
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
corporate sneakers for sure you you

610
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
won't produce them by yourself yeah you

611
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,799
go to nike adidas or whomever to to make

612
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,000
that for you

613
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,799
uh happen but when it comes to i.t

614
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,960
everybody feels oh a computer i'm the

615
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
profession in computer and i do it

616
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,440
all by myself yeah even if i'm the world

617
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,080
leader in producing a specific screw or

618
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,919
whatever

619
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,039
they all run their own i.t and

620
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
this is i guess the biggest failure we

621
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
need more cooperation we we need

622
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,400
more focus also on what we're doing what

623
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,520
we're good in

624
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
and to bring that knowledge better

625
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,799
together than than we're doing

626
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,679
it today cyrus for instance is a high

627
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,320
complex

628
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,840
uh topic to deal with and if you don't

629
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
have the experts available for that

630
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
that's an and battle you can't really

631
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
win

632
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
but if i understand you correctly boss

633
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
bruce and and also thomas

634
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,559
then every progress in law enforcement

635
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
and norms and so i

636
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,919
will fully depend on the willingness and

637
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,919
and also the incentives for

638
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
the tech industry to uh comply with new

639
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
or to to abide new

640
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
security standards how are we going to

641
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,360
change that i mean you were pretty

642
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
gloomy bruce

643
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,400
yeah we do not have an economic system

644
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
where companies

645
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,760
willingly lose money for social benefit

646
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
that's not that's what we do and and we

647
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,400
shouldn't

648
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
if we expect companies to you know not

649
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,480
employ child labor and

650
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
not buy and sell kidneys and have better

651
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,600
cyber security

652
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
we actually need government regulations

653
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
that is the way we do things

654
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,280
companies don't like this and they don't

655
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,080
want that and

656
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
anybody in the audience who's a company

657
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
is going to tell me why we shouldn't do

658
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
that

659
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
but we're not going to fix security

660
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
unless we actually piss big companies

661
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,200
off

662
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
this is no other way well alex you

663
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
worked against these big companies is

664
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,720
there any shift in the companies

665
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,039
i mean there has been i i think one of

666
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,840
the issues here is

667
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
we have a bunch of different security

668
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,919
problems actually right so you have

669
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,360
big companies on the high end that are

670
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
spending a lot of money on security um

671
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,919
they there are different things that

672
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,520
they need to do in some cases to protect

673
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,000
against this

674
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
level of adversary but they at least see

675
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,360
it as a priority and they have an

676
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,400
investment and so

677
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,520
companies that are doing okay are the

678
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
ones that have threat intelligence teams

679
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,520
that have

680
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,679
uh teams that can monitor and react in

681
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
real time that have the ability to

682
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,799
understand what's going on their network

683
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,039
that have all of their data in one place

684
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,520
then we have a huge chunk of companies

685
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,400
for which

686
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
we have real issues and that they have

687
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
security teams but they're not ready to

688
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
play at this level

689
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,919
and they're not ready for the you know

690
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,679
professional team from the svr to spend

691
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,039
six months breaking in

692
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,679
um and we don't have any really good

693
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,400
ways to

694
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,960
increase the leverage in those companies

695
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,159
to take their current event so they

696
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,520
probably need to invest more

697
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
but even if they're spending the money

698
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,760
we just don't have people sitting around

699
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
who have experience doing instant

700
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
response against the ministry of state

701
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
security who don't have jobs right like

702
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,679
it's not like there's a huge uh so we do

703
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,600
have to look at kind of society level uh

704
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
things to to increase capacity and then

705
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,720
at the small end

706
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,080
the real problem something that's

707
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
killing people is ransomware

708
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
and there's i get calls all the time

709
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
there's not much i can do from them

710
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
of companies that are important right

711
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
like a construction company

712
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
that sells a billion dollars a year that

713
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,799
that has tens of thousands of employees

714
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,280
to go

715
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
and build things you know getting shut

716
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
down by a ransomware attack

717
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,320
you're never going to have them to have

718
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
a big um uh

719
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
properly skilled security team like they

720
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
they couldn't invest their

721
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
increase their investment but you're

722
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,840
talking about there are thousands and

723
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
thousands of firms at that size

724
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
um and that's a real a real challenge

725
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
that we're probably gonna have to also

726
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,760
really go offensive

727
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
both legally and technically against the

728
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
ransomware teams to start to make it not

729
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,720
as profitable

730
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,000
because while we can improve our

731
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,840
protections there realistically there's

732
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,960
just way too many

733
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,679
potential victims to do so thomas have

734
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,039
you increased your investment at

735
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
deutsche telekom

736
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
we we do and we spend a couple of

737
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
millions every year for

738
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,520
for cyber defense uh for our networks

739
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
for our infrastructure

740
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
but the problem let me come back to the

741
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,799
the point of regulating the problem with

742
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,480
the regulation is that

743
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,120
in the current regimes we are trying to

744
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,000
regulate

745
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,840
at the companies who are using the

746
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,679
technologies but we don't see

747
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,919
the full supply chain yet yeah so when

748
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,520
we really want to make a difference we

749
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
need to start on the vendor

750
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,360
of a certain technology for instance if

751
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
we as dodger telecom are running a core

752
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
router in our network

753
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,919
we're relying on the vendor to get a

754
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,240
software update to get the vulnerability

755
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,080
fixed as we don't have access to the

756
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,919
source codes of these components

757
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
yeah so if we we want to have here

758
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,279
a better approach for the future and

759
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,960
there are some some

760
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
suggestions on the table in the european

761
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,320
um

762
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
market for instance and we need to

763
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
include the vendors

764
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,320
the ones operating the staff and the

765
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,159
users as well yeah so so we

766
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
we need to care on all entities dealing

767
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,279
with uh

768
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,240
the tech it's not only enough to to talk

769
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
to the operators and this is

770
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
what we mostly see in the current

771
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
regulation

772
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,840
yeah so but think about if you you

773
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
buying a car or whatever there is a ce

774
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
regulation in the european market and

775
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
you can simply

776
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,919
forbid the vendor to sell its stuff if

777
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,080
it's not meeting the requirements

778
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
but this is valid for mostly everything

779
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,360
except i.t security

780
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
when we talk about regulation when we

781
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,039
talk about the political environment we

782
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,400
have people here in the audience from

783
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
both europe and ds

784
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,559
who do you think will be the frontrunner

785
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,000
or be on the forefront in

786
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,480
creating a legal framework the european

787
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,600
commission where

788
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
you see a growing inclination to

789
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
regulate big attack

790
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,679
or the us where you see a similar move

791
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,360
or i have seen a similar movement for a

792
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
number of years and you mentioned alex

793
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,480
that there is more

794
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
of an effort now by the new incoming

795
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,840
administration

796
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,159
so do you think it will be a european or

797
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,000
an american thing to curb big tech

798
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
question to all of you who wants to jump

799
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,679
in first i mean so there's

800
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,279
there's all kinds of curb big tech

801
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,880
discussions i mean i think one thing

802
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
people talk about is antitrust

803
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,919
in which there's movement in both sides

804
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
but it seems like

805
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,799
some of that is more aggressive in

806
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,240
europe there's discussions around

807
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
content control so

808
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
we're never really going to have rules

809
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
around content in the united states

810
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,640
in the same way you can in europe uh

811
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
because of the first amendment

812
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,520
um so but for that area like the most

813
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
aggressive country democracy is actually

814
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
india and we're seeing right now

815
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,760
you know okay so if i was in munich what

816
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,400
i'd be hearing

817
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,159
all the time from europeans is we need

818
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
more regulation of big tech companies

819
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
i'm just going to point out there are a

820
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,880
lot of democracies in the world and most

821
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
of the democracies in the world do not

822
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,120
have

823
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
uh human rights based protections around

824
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,720
freedom of speech and don't have

825
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,240
protections for the speech of political

826
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
minorities and that's what's happening

827
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
right now in india

828
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,159
is that you have the indian government

829
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,480
using a legal system using court orders

830
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,799
to silence people who are questioning

831
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,679
the handling

832
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,880
of the um the pandemic by narendra modi

833
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
um in fact a man was not just silenced

834
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,799
but then arrested for tweeting that he

835
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,400
was looking for oxygen for his

836
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,039
so we gotta be real careful about when

837
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,880
you talk about this balance of who has

838
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
power over the speech of individuals

839
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,080
of how much of that power do you shift

840
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
into governments um and

841
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
the the truth that the truth is that

842
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
like a lot of this door was opened by an

843
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,039
sdg in germany

844
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,120
that after germany demonstrated we're

845
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
going to

846
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
have our speech rules be applied by the

847
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,400
tech companies without lawful process on

848
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
a per piece-to-speech basis

849
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
right there's no court order required or

850
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,120
anything we're just going to push our

851
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,039
legal requirements into the companies

852
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,520
we saw a huge number of countries the

853
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,039
turkey

854
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,159
russia vietnam a bunch of countries

855
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,600
now talk about having the same kind of

856
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,720
controls and that's what we're seeing in

857
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,360
india

858
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
so you know it's one thing to say the

859
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,640
company should be smaller

860
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
but and and they're like normal

861
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,080
anti-trust mechanisms for that but we

862
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,440
have to be really careful about the

863
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,159
kinds of

864
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,559
controls we put on people's speech um

865
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,840
and because it's very difficult to

866
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,640
decide which

867
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,159
why does germany get to have those kinds

868
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,000
of controls in india doesn't there's no

869
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
good way for the companies to decide

870
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
which of these laws they should pass or

871
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,799
not or they should follow or not

872
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,000
and so as a result if they're following

873
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,039
all these local laws you're going to end

874
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,080
up with some pretty

875
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
significant suppression of human rights

876
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
but what is your take for us is that no

877
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
good way to curb attack

878
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
so so so separately let's talk about you

879
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,480
know security and privacy and there

880
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,120
we're seeing

881
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,159
uh lots of of pushes of government i i

882
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,919
look to europe first europe really is

883
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,159
the regulatory superpower on the planet

884
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
and they're large enough so gdpr you

885
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,399
know we can discuss whether we like it

886
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,919
or not but that's a big push towards

887
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,039
privacy

888
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,840
california in the united states has

889
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
state laws there

890
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,919
and then we are also seeing security

891
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
laws california has entered a thing

892
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,720
security law

893
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,559
europe is looking at that europe is

894
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,320
looking at ways to

895
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,159
regulate ai safety and security

896
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,240
so i think the action comes from the eu

897
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
and then in the united states from some

898
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
of the states particularly in new york

899
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
massachusetts and california

900
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,760
the neat thing about good laws alex

901
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,039
talked about a race to the bottom

902
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,799
and if you have speech suppression laws

903
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,640
around the planet companies trying to

904
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,080
comply with all of them

905
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
you end up with a very bad world outcome

906
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,880
but for security laws it's the opposite

907
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,000
california has an iot security law one

908
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,520
of the provisions is no default

909
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,960
passwords

910
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,399
any company that sells i'll say a

911
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,640
thermostat is not going to have two

912
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,480
different thermostats one for california

913
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,600
one for everybody else

914
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,799
they're going to take out the default

915
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,360
password and sell it worldwide

916
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,360
so good laws for security and privacy

917
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,919
in a large enough market move the entire

918
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:16,559
planet

919
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,679
i worked for ibm they said we're going

920
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,960
to implement gdpr

921
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,039
worldwide because it's easier than

922
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,520
figuring out who is a european

923
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,919
so i you know i i like seeing good

924
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,880
security laws

925
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,679
in big markets let's talk briefly about

926
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,600
artificial intelligence before we

927
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,039
open it up for questions from the

928
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,200
audience do you think ai

929
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,880
is potentially a tool that is going to

930
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,960
improve cyber security or not

931
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,240
all right i'm going to start because i

932
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
just wrote an essay on ai hackers which

933
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,039
i i

934
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,679
urge people to

935
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
right there's an download race here an

936
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,559
ai benefits

937
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,360
attack it benefits defense and we don't

938
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
know how this is going to shake out in

939
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,000
the end

940
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,039
a.i advances are very discontinuous

941
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,640
things we think are easy or hard things

942
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,039
to think

943
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,480
hard to not to be easy and you know as

944
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
technologies ratchet up it's hard to

945
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,799
know who's going to come out on top

946
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,000
near term i think ai benefits defense

947
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
because already computers are hacking

948
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,520
computers are attacking at computer

949
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,440
speed and we're not defending at

950
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,559
computer speeds

951
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,880
and we have this skill shortage which

952
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
alex mentioned

953
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,279
and the more ais can help augment

954
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,480
and speed up human response we get a

955
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
real near-term benefit

956
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
but long-term i mean your guess is as

957
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,760
good as mine

958
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,480
thomas and alex you're taking yeah so so

959
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,600
in my view

960
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,480
um first of all most of the things we're

961
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
we're calling ai these days

962
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
are artificial for sure but mostly not

963
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,760
intelligent yeah

964
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,320
so i would say it's more about machine

965
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
learning where we're still dealing with

966
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,159
and it's it's far away from being real

967
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,039
ai

968
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,120
nevertheless we will enter that space

969
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
and we'll come closer and closer to that

970
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,480
even if it would take

971
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,200
some time but the challenge with that

972
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,760
will be

973
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
that attackers also using these

974
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,799
technologies

975
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,120
they're also using this to adopt their

976
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,159
mechanism so

977
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,159
it's an ongoing battle on the defense

978
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,919
and on the attack side

979
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,399
um which helping both of them yeah for

980
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,919
sure it's helped to

981
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,919
find the needle in the needle stack yeah

982
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,240
so we're by far not any longer

983
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,159
searching for needles in haystacks we're

984
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,240
searching for needles in needle stacks

985
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,640
and for the attackers it helps them to

986
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,960
find the weak point the single one

987
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,840
in your huge infrastructure and and

988
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,200
that's the challenge and

989
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,360
with regards to the regulation i guess

990
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,440
it's the wrong question to ask who is

991
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,000
the first

992
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,760
in doing the regulation on it whether

993
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,000
it's ai or whether it's i.t security or

994
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,519
iot security

995
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,919
it must be more the question how to

996
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,039
overcome that

997
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,159
different kind of of approaches

998
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,240
how to work closely together as we are

999
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,360
all connected

1000
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,240
via internet connections just some

1001
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
milliseconds away from each other

1002
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,960
um but but we're still behaving in our

1003
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,360
regulation regime as we are really far

1004
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,880
away from each other which is

1005
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,519
true for the physical world but it's not

1006
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,679
true for the digital world anymore

1007
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
alex your brief take before we turn to

1008
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,360
the audience

1009
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,880
i i mean ai is is a massively

1010
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
one there's much more artificial than

1011
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,840
intelligence and current ai so i'm going

1012
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,039
to use the term machine learning

1013
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,120
machine learning is a massively

1014
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
overhyped from both its downsides and

1015
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,760
upsides um

1016
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,799
and and so i'm i'm uh i i

1017
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,080
i'm not going to offer opinion because

1018
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,519
i'm not going to feed into it let's be

1019
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,399
honest

1020
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,880
great that was brief in any case so we

1021
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,919
want to open up the

1022
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,679
audience and there are uh there's a

1023
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,120
bunch of questions so i

1024
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
i'm asking you to keep your answers

1025
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,399
short

1026
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
so that we can uh ask as many questions

1027
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,760
as possible

1028
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
there is one from the audience for you

1029
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,480
thomas from deutsche telekom

1030
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,640
does everything need to be in the matrix

1031
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
why does a refrigerator need to be an

1032
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,679
internet of things device are we control

1033
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,640
of our life

1034
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,000
with the internet of things it's a good

1035
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,519
question and a funny story i had a

1036
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,120
conversation with with one of my

1037
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,799
teammates on that and i

1038
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,559
asked why the heck are we connecting

1039
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,840
these kind of devices

1040
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,559
because we're able to do and this is the

1041
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,159
most honest answer

1042
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,760
in most of the cases but but

1043
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
nevertheless

1044
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
connecting devices uh can also build

1045
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
really certain use cases for us making

1046
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,799
our life easier and more comfortable

1047
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,679
when it's done in the right way but uh

1048
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,080
just

1049
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,399
connecting things because you're able to

1050
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,600
do is

1051
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
surely a stupid way to to do the

1052
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
digitization

1053
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,559
yeah so at the moment i have no idea for

1054
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,919
what reason my fridge should be

1055
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,240
connected but there might be good reason

1056
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,159
um and there may be a use case for that

1057
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,320
in future which i don't know yet

1058
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,720
but what's important is once it is

1059
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,799
connected we need to take care that it's

1060
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,200
connected securely from the first stage

1061
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
and as bruce mentioned in this in this

1062
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,559
intro it's becoming more and more

1063
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,080
important that we have

1064
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,359
not any longer only authentication from

1065
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,520
users to systems we need it from systems

1066
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,918
to systems from processes to processes

1067
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,800
so it's a much bigger bigger regime of

1068
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
authentication we need in future to

1069
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,359
build these secure connectivity

1070
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,599
we have another question that i wanted

1071
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,199
let me jump in and explain quickly why

1072
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,399
your refrigerator is connected because

1073
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,159
it's a really good explanation

1074
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,879
so 15 years ago someone wanted to build

1075
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,839
a refrigerator

1076
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,159
they would make a some kind of circuitry

1077
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,079
and controls they'd make custom

1078
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,399
electronics for the refrigerator today

1079
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,918
you want to build a refrigerator

1080
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,800
you pull a raspberry pi off the shelf

1081
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,399
and you write some software

1082
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,359
and that raspberry pi comes with an

1083
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,079
internet stack

1084
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
it comes with a video port comes with a

1085
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,918
with an audio port

1086
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,399
so you've got that technology already

1087
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,119
built in

1088
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,599
because it's cheaper and once it's there

1089
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,359
it's cheap to use

1090
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,599
so that's why all these things are

1091
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,400
connected

1092
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
because the way we build them has

1093
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
changed from custom software

1094
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,720
and custom circuitry to just an

1095
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,599
off-the-shelf

1096
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,640
cpu thanks bruce for

1097
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,680
pointing out that out and the magic of

1098
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,720
the internet of things

1099
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,839
i have one question that i want to

1100
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,400
direct to you alex and and bruce because

1101
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,880
it's

1102
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
on the political regulation that we were

1103
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,000
talking about

1104
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,079
it says companies like facebook or tick

1105
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
tock need to be forced

1106
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,400
to comply with local rules and to be

1107
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
held accountable for

1108
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,240
for taxes primarily and rules of course

1109
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,560
otherwise discussing cyber security

1110
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,920
is senseless do you agree

1111
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,839
i have no opinion on tax laws i mean

1112
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,119
countries should

1113
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,480
pass tax laws that they think are

1114
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,640
appropriate uh and you know i think if

1115
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,119
we have

1116
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,040
uh more um consistency in those then

1117
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,480
you'll end up with better enforcement

1118
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,800
um you know right now a lot of countries

1119
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
have mechanisms by which you can

1120
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,359
shift your revenue there um but you know

1121
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,000
that's

1122
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
that's not something i'm an expert in um

1123
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,359
on security stuff i

1124
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,440
no i i don't agree there's a bunch of

1125
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,960
companies that are really motivated here

1126
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,320
and they are victims of either crimes or

1127
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
geopolitical attacks um

1128
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,280
and the idea that you can just regulate

1129
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,480
your way into security is absolutely

1130
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,680
false

1131
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,400
first i'm more optimistic but it's

1132
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,160
definitely not the only thing you can do

1133
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,800
but i think we

1134
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,920
do have to change the economic

1135
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,440
incentives because right now the

1136
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,480
economic incentives

1137
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
i mean solar solarwinds is a great

1138
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,000
example i mean that that that is a

1139
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,640
uh a private equity funded company and

1140
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,040
their

1141
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,800
economic incentives were to make their

1142
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
stuff as lousy as possible

1143
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,040
without losing customers right that was

1144
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,640
their economic model

1145
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,760
and and that's just not a good one for

1146
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,240
security we have another

1147
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,200
question that is very broad so probably

1148
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,599
uh

1149
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,640
each one of you want to jump in it says

1150
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,599
what does digital

1151
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,160
sovereignty mean to you is it realistic

1152
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,119
at all

1153
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,480
maybe if you want to start alex

1154
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,280
good luck digital sovereignty yeah

1155
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,320
i mean so this is one of the key

1156
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
questions is are citizens and countries

1157
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,720
allowed to

1158
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,920
voluntarily opt into the use of products

1159
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,480
or the

1160
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
to be part of communities that are run

1161
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
out of other countries right so

1162
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
we you know we keep on having these

1163
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,040
arguments around

1164
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
who gets to control multinational

1165
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
networks

1166
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,400
and you know last year there's a big

1167
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,040
brouhaha in the u.s around tiktok

1168
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,400
in which the roles were reversed

1169
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
traditionally you've had non-american

1170
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,760
jurisdictions

1171
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
especially in europe complaining about

1172
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,119
american law

1173
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,560
and the lack of control over american

1174
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,160
companies and in this case the united

1175
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,040
states was saying

1176
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,520
was complaining about um a product that

1177
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,119
americans were choosing to use that was

1178
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,560
made by a chinese company

1179
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
um and whether or not you know who gets

1180
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
to make the decisions about what how

1181
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,800
that's managed i think

1182
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
so one i mean this is get this is super

1183
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,599
complicated we don't have enough time to

1184
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,560
talk about it like

1185
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,920
there are countries that have really

1186
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
good arguments here in their countries

1187
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,079
that their arguments are around keeping

1188
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,440
the people in power and power right so

1189
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
that's what's going on in india right

1190
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:02,880
now

1191
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,520
so um you know and so there's a lot of

1192
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,040
people that throw out some kind of basic

1193
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,839
ideas here

1194
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,359
that don't think through the actual

1195
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,800
texture of what it is like to give

1196
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,599
sovereignty

1197
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,720
to all of the different countries in the

1198
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
world especially in situations where the

1199
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,599
really horrible things are being

1200
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,640
permeated you know

1201
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,440
the myanmar having their is it a

1202
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
violation of digital sovereignty for the

1203
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,839
myanmar government

1204
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,839
to have their community their their

1205
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,280
mechanism shut down for

1206
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,119
justifying the genocide that they're

1207
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
conducting against their own minorities

1208
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,040
right like it it gets really really

1209
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,400
complicated very fast

1210
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,760
um what i'd like to see is i'd like to

1211
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,200
see democracies work together on this

1212
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,760
and there's

1213
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,200
the things that you know between the us

1214
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,960
and europe the the vast majority of

1215
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,560
goals are the same

1216
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,160
of what they want out of uh out of

1217
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,680
digital platforms um

1218
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,440
and i'd love to see kind of an alliance

1219
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,720
of democracies here

1220
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
regulate in a way that is compatible um

1221
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,760
and that

1222
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,560
explicitly sets rules around uh human

1223
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,280
rights

1224
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,480
um that then are uh you know flow down

1225
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,160
in our benefit to citizens of either

1226
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,560
developing democracies like india um or

1227
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,640
non-democracies like myanmar

1228
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,480
and that kind of cooperation does not

1229
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
seem likely on the horizon

1230
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
right do you think that i think that is

1231
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
feasible bruce an alliance of

1232
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,160
democracies on that issue

1233
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,760
so don't know i think i'm going to be

1234
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,280
very broad here with this broad question

1235
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,400
i think we're seeing

1236
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
a mismatch in in the size of government

1237
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,400
units and historically that's always

1238
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,440
been

1239
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,640
having to do with the speed of

1240
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
communication and transportation

1241
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,520
uh you know city states and local uh

1242
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
moving into in the mid 1700s

1243
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,560
uh or later in the 1800s things that are

1244
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
kind of the u.s state-sized european

1245
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,680
country size

1246
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,960
and now we have the united states the eu

1247
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,599
they're all representing the the kind of

1248
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,440
size of thing

1249
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
that with communication association you

1250
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
can effectively

1251
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,920
deal with and now we are getting more

1252
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,599
into global problems

1253
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,000
and whether it's the internet or or

1254
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,520
climate change

1255
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,599
or uh bio i mean these are all global

1256
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,079
problems and now the large country size

1257
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:02,880
governments

1258
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,359
aren't really suitable for the task this

1259
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,880
is a way bigger problem they're going to

1260
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
solve in this panel

1261
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,760
but i think that's what we're seeing

1262
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,680
here that and that's

1263
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,480
why a lot of things aren't working

1264
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,200
because the

1265
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,880
eu size the u.s size even the india size

1266
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,359
the china

1267
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,599
is not a really good size of government

1268
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,160
to deal with these issues we need bigger

1269
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,359
and we don't really have those

1270
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,359
mechanisms

1271
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,359
well as always we are strictly regulated

1272
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,359
here time wise on that panel so we have

1273
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,880
exactly one minute left

1274
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,680
for your take thomas yeah so i would say

1275
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,280
first of all when we talk about digital

1276
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,119
serenity it's a question how we would

1277
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,000
define that

1278
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,760
um to really achieve full sovereignty

1279
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
it's quite impossible i guess but

1280
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,000
uh what do we need instead at least we

1281
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,839
need the ability to judge and to measure

1282
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,280
technology which will not have our hands

1283
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,240
on and where we

1284
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,960
don't in control of the supply chain

1285
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,800
this is becoming more important than

1286
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
ever before in my view

1287
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
so certification inspection and and

1288
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
these kind of things we need to work on

1289
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,200
on

1290
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,839
these kind of skill sets to have that at

1291
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,599
least here when we're depending on

1292
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,920
foreign markets

1293
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,760
thanks so much thomas i hope the talking

1294
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,599
had started making sense

1295
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,160
and i really hope we can reconnect next

1296
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,599
year in person

1297
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,079
alex can bring his family as he already

1298
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,040
announced

1299
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,319
um and thanks so much alex bruce thomas

1300
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,760
thanks so much for putting this panel

1301
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,440
together peter and

1302
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,240
uh well uh we will see you soon

1303
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,839
hopefully next year in antarctica
