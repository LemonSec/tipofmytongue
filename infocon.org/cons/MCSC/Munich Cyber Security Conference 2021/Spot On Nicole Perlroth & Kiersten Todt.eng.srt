i'm very happy to have you both here

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,680
today

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
thank you so much and thanks for the

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,920
opportunity to be a part of this

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,399
tremendous conference today

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,320
nicole it's great to have you and first

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
of all uh congratulations on the

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
great success of your book but

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
importantly for the issues

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
that you've brought to the forefront um

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
your book has certainly catalyzed some

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
important conversations and i think

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,399
we could make a conference on all of the

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
issues that you brought forward we only

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,520
have 15 minutes so we'll

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
we'll do our best um but one of the

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
issues that's been coming up a lot even

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,879
just in the discussion this morning from

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,760
this conference

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,719
is about defense and cyber defense you

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,000
have a quote in the book from

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
chris inglis that talks about um

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
a soccer score and he he says if we were

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,080
to score cyber security the way we score

35
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,720
soccer

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
the tally would be 462 to 456 20 minutes

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,799
into the game

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
uh really talking about how we focus on

39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
offense but as we know and as we've seen

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,840
of these

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
with these recent events the real issue

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
is looking at how we can be stronger

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
from a defensive perspective

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,159
and what we need to do and so in looking

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,759
at this we talk about deterrence but

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
it's also about how do we compel

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
our nation-state adversaries to change

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,200
their behavior

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,960
what are the consequences that we can

50
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
put out there that actually deter

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,920
bad action and in uh pivot offering off

52
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,400
of the

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
recent panel it's more than just

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
cooperation it's collective action

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
so we'd just love to get your thoughts

56
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,920
on based on all the research that you've

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,320
done

58
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
what are your thoughts on how we can do

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
better not just uh

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
independently but importantly with our

61
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
global partners

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
in uh collective defense and in really

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
looking at cyber defense

64
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
thanks kirsten and thanks to everyone at

65
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
the munich security conference for

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
having me i know we're short on time so

67
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,840
i'll just start speed talking here

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,639
to solve the world's cyber problems um

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,038
so

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
i think what's really critical here is

71
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
we have to change the incentive models

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
where we are right now is in a place

73
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
where

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
businesses are still very much under the

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
mindset of i have to get my code to

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
market i have to get my product

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,959
out there before the competition and get

78
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
as much market share as i can and i will

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
win and i will fix security problems

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
and glitches later and from an

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
individual perspective we still see

82
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,239
security

83
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,080
for the most part as annoying we don't

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
want to be bothered with

85
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
multi-factor authentication and software

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
update prompts etc

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,319
and then at government you know the

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
incentives are still not perfectly

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,400
aligned in a lot of cases governments

90
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,879
particularly over the last 10 years

91
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,840
have sacrificed cyber security in the

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
name of national security whatever

93
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,800
that means to them and in a lot of cases

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,159
in the united states that has been

95
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000
counterintelligence operations

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
maintaining

97
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,159
uh espionage and also

98
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
battlefield preparations increasingly as

99
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
countries see that they want to

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
embed themselves in another country's

101
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,319
infrastructure in the event they might

102
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,519
have to conduct

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
some some kind of hybrid warfare so we

104
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
really have to address

105
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
the incentive models and i think in

106
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
terms of collaboration

107
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,599
um one of the things is putting pressure

108
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,120
on bad actors together and in multiple

109
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,840
forms

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
you know right now let's just look at

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,440
cyber crime and ransomware

112
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
you know there are basically ransomware

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,560
safe havens

114
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
in the world many of them in eastern

115
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
europe and russia

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
where they will not arrest or extradite

117
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
any of the cyber criminals there that

118
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
are conducting billions of dollars in

119
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
ransomware attacks

120
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,840
on u.s cities a police department in dc

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,439
this week honeywell

122
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,080
um so what do we do and i think this is

123
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
really an area for international

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
cooperation where

125
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
we could agree not only on sanctions

126
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
but um perhaps on restricting

127
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
visas travel visas student visas putting

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
pressure domestically

129
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,358
uh on these countries to actually

130
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
address their cyber criminal problem

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
i think could be a big step and a really

132
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
big opportunity for some international

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
collaboration there

134
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
do you think there is a space for uh

135
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,960
penalties

136
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
for consequences i know you and i have

137
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
talked about the fact that

138
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
we as a nation and then globally with

139
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
our partners we often think about how

140
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,160
the adversary will respond

141
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
uh can we get to a point where the

142
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
adversary worries about how we will

143
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
respond

144
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
yes you know you and i have talked about

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
this we're always asking well how will

146
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
russia respond

147
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
to sanctions or if we conduct some sort

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:54,720
of

149
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,000
unseen cyber response for a russian

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
cyber attack on our grid and we really

151
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
need to get to a place

152
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
of uh stop worrying about what vladimir

153
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,639
putin will think

154
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
if we respond or retaliate to some of

155
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,080
these

156
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
very aggressive cyber attacks on

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,840
businesses

158
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,479
and the grid and even you know wolf

159
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
creek nuclear plants

160
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
enterprise networks so how do we do that

161
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
and i think

162
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
that's really where defense is going to

163
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
help a lot if we

164
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,360
are continue to be in this place we're

165
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
still so

166
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
vulnerable to an attack on

167
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
electrical utilities water treatment

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
plants etc we're never

169
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
going to get to a place where we don't

170
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,160
have to worry about how vladimir putin

171
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,280
will respond

172
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
um but i also just think at this point

173
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
you know look at where we are

174
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
how have we responded to some of the

175
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,960
russian incursions

176
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,840
on our grid for instance well you know

177
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,560
we have

178
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
um issued sanctions but also you know we

179
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
broke the story a couple years ago

180
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
that we have been making our own loud

181
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
incursions into the russian grid that

182
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,080
u.s cyber command has been doing that

183
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
over the past few years so we have

184
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
enshrined the grid

185
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,080
as a legitimate target essentially for

186
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
digitally mutually assured destruction

187
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,800
but if we're going to continue down that

188
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,680
path

189
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
i think that's really where defense

190
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,039
becomes really important because you do

191
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,160
not want

192
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,400
to just keep throwing stones out of the

193
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
glassiest of glass houses it's

194
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
really important that we make serious

195
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
investment

196
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,919
into hardening our defenses particularly

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,840
at critical infrastructure and

198
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,800
especially if we're going to continue to

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
lay logic bombs in some of our

200
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,160
adversaries infrastructure too

201
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
so earlier today in the conference tom

202
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
burt talked about

203
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
from microsoft talked about the solar

204
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
winds event

205
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
and the microsoft exchange event and i

206
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
know something that you've been

207
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,120
uh extremely articulate about is this uh

208
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
the closing of the capabilities gap

209
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,759
between

210
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
our nation-state adversaries and the

211
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
united states and you know we often

212
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
there's a concept from terrorism and

213
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
security that's

214
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
you know if you have intent but with

215
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
with no capabilities you're not that

216
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
destructive or capabilities without the

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,639
intent but when you have both intent and

218
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,759
capabilities

219
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
uh it can be very dangerous so can you

220
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,960
talk a little bit to

221
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,240
this closing gap of capabilities

222
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,400
yeah so you know 10 years ago

223
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
u.s national intelligence estimate said

224
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
russia was our most sophisticated

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
adversary in cyberspace

226
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
china was the more imminent threat

227
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
because it was attacking our

228
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,240
intellectual property left and right

229
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
with no end in sight but then there were

230
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
these other actors like iran and north

231
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,759
korea that had the intent

232
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,680
that lacked the capabilities and what

233
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
has happened over the last 10 years

234
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
is that those actors have caught up now

235
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,120
they are still

236
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
nowhere near where the united states and

237
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,560
some of our closest

238
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,879
allies are in terms of our offensive

239
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,479
capabilities right

240
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,360
no country has been able to pull off

241
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,879
anything close

242
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,840
to stuxnet since that was discovered in

243
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800
2010

244
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
and i really walked away from the

245
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
research in my book with this very

246
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
simple conclusion which is

247
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
the us is still the world's top cyber

248
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,879
super power but the thing that we forget

249
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,039
is that we are now the most targeted

250
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,479
nation state on earth

251
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,680
not just by our adversaries but by cyber

252
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
criminals

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
countries like iran might not have our

254
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,000
offensive

255
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
capabilities but iran has gone from

256
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
something of a digital backwater when

257
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,240
stuxnet was discovered in 2010

258
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
to now and this is shocking to me but

259
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,599
last year

260
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,320
research showed it was one of the most

261
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,039
prolific

262
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,760
adversaries that the united states now

263
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
faces in cyberspace

264
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
and they don't need stuxnet they can

265
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
pull off quite a lot of damage

266
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
with rudimentary wiping code so we are

267
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,240
now a place where not only are we the

268
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
most targeted but in

269
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
some ways we are also the most

270
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,440
vulnerable because we are so wired up

271
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
because we are so virtualized

272
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
so this idea that we could continue with

273
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
our advantage and offense and then that

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
would somehow be a deterrent

275
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
to these other nation states and that it

276
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
would take much longer decades even for

277
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
them to catch up it's just no longer the

278
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
reality

279
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
and we have to readjust our risk

280
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
calculus for where we are now

281
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,240
which is we are vulnerable we are

282
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,839
getting targeted

283
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,640
yes we are still ahead but it is very

284
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,360
critical

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
we are a serious inflection point where

286
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
we have to start recalibrating for

287
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,040
defense

288
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
and one of the things i know and and how

289
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
you've talked about the vulnerability

290
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,399
and you just mentioned this is this open

291
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,680
economy that we're so

292
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
open and so uh what is critical

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
as far as infrastructure those lines

294
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
have become more and more blurred

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
and for the last couple of years i've

296
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
been thinking through and talking a lot

297
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:50,720
about

298
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
how you know cloud is becoming critical

299
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,240
infrastructure it has become critical

300
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
infrastructure i would even assert

301
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,839
that uh social media platforms in some

302
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,200
way have become that but you said

303
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
something

304
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,839
that i thought was pretty disruptive and

305
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,519
and really makes a ton of sense as we're

306
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,399
looking at this that

307
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,959
code is critical infrastructure excuse

308
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,440
me

309
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
can you talk a little bit about that

310
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,640
because when we talk about this open

311
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
economy and you talked about economic

312
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
incentives this idea that

313
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,079
we don't prioritize security uh we

314
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
prioritize profit over security profit

315
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
isn't bad but if we're doing it at the

316
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
cost of security it's a challenge so as

317
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,560
we look at these private companies

318
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
that are developing the code for our

319
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,680
infrastructure

320
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
uh talk a little bit about code's

321
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
infrastructure and how we can

322
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
then assert more secure code in our

323
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,880
digital economy

324
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,839
which is global yeah and it's not even

325
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,240
just proprietary code it's open source

326
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
code

327
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
and the example i always point to is

328
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
heartbleed you know this was a

329
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,440
vulnerability

330
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
and an open source protocol that was

331
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
used for security

332
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,160
not just by the fbi but by some it was

333
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
baked into some pentagon weapon systems

334
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
it was used by amazon

335
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,079
it was used by some of the world's top

336
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,760
technology companies

337
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
and when someone found a gaping hole

338
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,920
that would allow them to use

339
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
the vulnerability in that protocol to

340
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,839
break into those systems and disrupt the

341
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,519
security of those systems

342
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
we found out it just was being

343
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
maintained by two guys

344
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
in the uk that was were operating on the

345
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,399
shoestring budget

346
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
of three thousand dollars while their

347
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,000
code was making its way

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
into the pentagon's weapon systems so

349
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
what do we do about that i

350
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
i do argue that that that code is now

351
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,760
critical infrastructure

352
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,839
and so i think some of the things we

353
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,800
have to do

354
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,839
is do a survey of how what code is

355
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,720
making its way

356
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
into our critical infrastructure and

357
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,360
that's something that the linux

358
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
foundation

359
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,079
has actually been doing over the last

360
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
few years they've been conducting a

361
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,839
census effort to identify

362
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
code that they believe to be critical

363
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,200
infrastructure

364
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
so that then we can brainstorm ways to

365
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
figure out how to fund it

366
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
how to secure it and how to vet the

367
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
researchers and engineers who are

368
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
working and maintaining that code which

369
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
is also important

370
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
but i think we could start with just a

371
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
bill of materials you know when solar

372
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,079
winds hit

373
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
a lot of the victims i spoke to didn't

374
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,079
even know they used solar winds and when

375
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,560
i dug into the security of solar winds

376
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
none of our american customers at the

377
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
department of

378
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,720
energy or their nuclear labs that used

379
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,120
solarwinds and granted it such

380
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
tremendous access into their networks

381
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,160
knew that that

382
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
code was really being built and

383
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,240
maintained in belarus and overseas and

384
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,360
that there was very little

385
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
little visibility into the secure

386
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,959
design of that code if any you know the

387
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,000
fact that the

388
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
the um password to get into the software

389
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,920
update mechanism at one point was

390
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,160
solarwinds123

391
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,639
so we could start just by taking

392
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,920
inventory

393
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
of what code is in some of our most

394
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
critical systems in government

395
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,079
in the grid in our water treatment

396
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,639
facilities and then figuring out

397
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,120
how that code is secured and maintained

398
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,279
do those operators have strong password

399
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,040
management protocols in place do they

400
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
use multi-factor authentication

401
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
um you know do they have intrusion

402
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,440
detection meta mitigations in place and

403
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
if not

404
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
why not and how do we help fund those

405
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
basic security standards either with

406
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
federal grants

407
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,279
um or by incentivizing them to get them

408
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,959
through tax credits perhaps um and do we

409
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,440
do do we require that they undergo

410
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
serious penetration tests

411
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,959
you know is that something that we do

412
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
and then do we consider penalties for

413
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,079
some companies

414
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,880
that simply have been using unsupported

415
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,279
software over the last few years even as

416
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,040
their software makes its way into the

417
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,839
grid

418
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,519
those are all questions i don't have the

419
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,959
answer to but we're not we haven't even

420
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,720
been asking those questions

421
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
over the past few years and the good

422
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,160
news from solarwinds and hapnium and the

423
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,519
ransomware

424
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
surge we're seeing right now is the new

425
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,320
administration here in the united states

426
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,560
and

427
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,720
and i think globally governments have

428
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
woken up to the fact that these are

429
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,199
questions that

430
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,560
urgently need answering so you're

431
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,079
talking a lot about kind of

432
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,800
the the preparation the defense uh

433
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,240
before an event and i think this is

434
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
really important because

435
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,959
in the united states we've had a

436
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,320
dialogue over the last couple months

437
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
about data breach notification about and

438
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,000
after action when events happen

439
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and i don't think anyone would question

440
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
that those things are important

441
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
um but i was talking recently to a

442
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,440
former uh a retired general in the army

443
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
who said

444
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,600
you know it's sort of like standing in

445
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
the ashes of a burned house and saying

446
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
well you know you had a faulty wire you

447
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
should have called 9-1-1 in the future

448
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
we need to get to that place where we've

449
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
prevented the fire and while again all

450
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,240
of those things that happen after the

451
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
event are important we haven't invested

452
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,959
enough

453
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
on that pre-event engagement whether

454
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
it's industry government

455
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,880
um you've just put out a lot of great

456
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,720
recommendations and thoughts about other

457
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,360
actions

458
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
are there other things that you in all

459
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
of the research that you've seen that

460
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
have been effective

461
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,079
or where we have fallen short globally

462
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,279
in that you know

463
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,920
the phrase left of boom pre-event where

464
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
we haven't done enough

465
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
and what can we be doing right now with

466
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
this urgent call to action for that

467
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
defense and preparation piece

468
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
well in the united states where we've

469
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,839
really fallen

470
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
short is kicking out any idea or

471
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
proposal

472
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
regarding mandating basic cyber security

473
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,519
requirements for critical infrastructure

474
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
companies you know that was a bill

475
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,639
that was proposed way back in 2012

476
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
um at the very start of a lot of russian

477
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
incursions into the u.s

478
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
grid and when we were catching china

479
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
hacking into companies that operate our

480
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
critical infrastructure and even then

481
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
um we decided here in the united states

482
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
or i should say lobbyists and

483
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
legislators decided

484
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
that it would be too burdensome for

485
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
those companies just to

486
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,720
be required to be basic cyber security

487
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,759
requirements

488
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
and since then any kind of legislation

489
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
or proposals that have come down have

490
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
been in the form of a presidential

491
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
executive order

492
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
that really lacks a lot of teeth that

493
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
basically just makes best practice

494
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
recommendations

495
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
for these companies to you know meet

496
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
these standards and i think

497
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,279
at this point now it is critical if

498
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
we're not going to

499
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
require companies by law or penalize

500
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
companies by law

501
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,399
for not having multi-factor

502
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,240
authentication and

503
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,639
patching in place and and software that

504
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
they can patch at all

505
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,839
then we have to think about incentives

506
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,120
and that's where i come back to what i

507
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,399
was saying earlier about

508
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
perhaps we consider tax credits for

509
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,079
companies that subject themselves to

510
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,160
penetration tests by hackers

511
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,959
um and show that they do meet you know a

512
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,360
bear

513
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
baseline of cyber security and and i

514
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,680
think there are other things we can do

515
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,160
there

516
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
um to fund those programs through

517
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
federal grants etc

518
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,759
and i think one of the pieces here too

519
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,519
is we often think of solutions lying in

520
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,399
technology

521
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,240
but so much of it is human behavior and

522
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,519
education and training

523
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
on strong authentication uh software

524
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
updates and those pieces

525
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
uh we only have one minute left and so

526
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,079
i'll give you two questions and you can

527
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
choose if i do one or the other or do

528
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,279
both of them quickly

529
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,240
um as looking getting more toward a

530
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
positive perspective what do you think

531
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,679
would be a nation's metric for success

532
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,520
in cyber security right now

533
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
and this may link to the second question

534
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,199
um in wrapping up what's the one thing

535
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,959
that you learned in the research of your

536
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
book this is how they tell us the world

537
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,439
ends

538
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,839
that was particularly surprising or

539
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,480
educational

540
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
oh gosh well

541
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
i learned so much in the course of the

542
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
book and it probably ties into your

543
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
first question

544
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,720
um what i what i learned

545
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,559
from the book you know given we have one

546
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,799
minute here what i learned from the book

547
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
is what i said earlier that offense

548
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,559
alone

549
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
is not going to get us out of this mess

550
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,840
we really need to gain more urgency and

551
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,559
awareness

552
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,080
about what has been happening in the

553
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,679
cyber threat landscape

554
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,400
unfortunately much like the pandemic

555
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
this is a threat that is invisible

556
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
until it hits you and then you feel it

557
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
and you start asking why didn't we do

558
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,240
anything about this

559
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,160
where were our masks where were our pp

560
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
where are our ventilators

561
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,280
well we haven't had that cataclysmic

562
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
cyber induced kinetic attack yet but we

563
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,400
have come

564
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
very close probably most notably with

565
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,440
the not pecha attack a few years ago

566
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,240
um and you know we see nation states

567
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
getting into our grid

568
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
we see them holding our hospitals ransom

569
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
with ransomware we see

570
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
the dc police department held hostage

571
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,000
with ransomware and

572
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,880
threatened um to pay with threats that

573
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
they would release informant lists

574
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,400
i mean this is crazy and so i think

575
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
the the biggest thing i took away was

576
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
this is a this is much more urgent

577
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,679
than i think the world realizes and

578
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,120
it is not uh necessary that we wait

579
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
for that kinetic induced cyber event

580
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
that causes

581
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
massive loss of life to do something

582
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
you know we have already seen our

583
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,960
intellectual property walk out the door

584
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,720
we've already seen our nuclear plants

585
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
targeted

586
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
and that's not an intellectual property

587
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,559
theft that is a battlefield preparation

588
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,880
attack so my biggest takeaway was

589
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
don't stop offense you know adversaries

590
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
need to pay a price

591
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,039
they clearly have not been deterred for

592
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
the last decade nothing we have done in

593
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
the form of sanctions

594
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
has deterred russia from continuing to

595
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
probe our grid and some of its

596
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
disinformation activities which is a

597
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
whole other area

598
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
so we should be imposing costs um

599
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
serious costs

600
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
on russia for those attacks but to do

601
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
that we really need to make sure

602
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,280
that our house isn't so glassy you know

603
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
we really need to shore up our defenses

604
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,840
so we can be in a position of strength

605
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,880
um and not worry about what russia will

606
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,600
do

607
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
um in terms of attacking us

608
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
infrastructure and our allies

609
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,559
and ukraine should we actually retaliate

610
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,320
for some of these attacks and that is

611
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
that is probably the biggest takeaway is

612
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
defense defense defense

613
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,159
and not just pouring money at the

614
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,120
problem but actually smart depends

615
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,880
hence the title this is how they tell me

616
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
the world ends um nicole pearl roth
