building digital sovereignty in a

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,440
multi-polar world

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,880
moderated by a frequent guest of mcsc

he was heading digital europe until

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,840

please introduce your guests

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
one of the beauties of a conference that

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
runs over a number of years and i

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,600
believe this is the

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
seventh edition now is that um

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
you can see the journey of a topic as it

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
gets discussed from year to year and

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
we've had some great discussions about

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,680
digital sovereignty

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
um in this conference over the last few

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
years um and i know this

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
year's is going to be well as good if

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080
not better

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
than any i'm going to take the first few

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,840
minutes of the panel discussion to

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
set the scene and then i'm going to go

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,200
through

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
two rounds of questions with our

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,560
panelists who i'll introduce

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
as i ask them the first question um

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
of course our discussions will be

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,920
largely through a european

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,200
lens but as we heard from ambassador

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
ishinger earlier um we're not in an

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
isolated world in fact as the agenda

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
said a multi-polar world so our

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
the context of our relations with

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
particularly china and u.s but other

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,799
parts

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
of the world too i'm sure will come out

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,799
in the discussions i really want to for

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
to try and frame the discussion in

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
two substantive parts to start with

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
first of all a broader discussion

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
to help us understand digital

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
sovereignty and what it means

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
before then diving into the implications

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
for cyber security so you know what does

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
it mean first

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
and then what does it mean for uh cyber

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
security a second

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
i do want to have some time if i manage

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,160
this correctly to have some

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,760
questions from the from you the audience

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,239
and our colleagues at the conference

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,760
will be monitoring the chat

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,480
so please put questions um in in the

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
chat

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,080
and our colleagues will be monitoring

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
and we'll be synthesizing

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
and hopefully we'll get the opportunity

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,000
to put some of those points

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
to our very distinguished panel today

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
um so the story so far

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
i mean this is the bit at the beginning

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,879
of the latest episode of highmat or

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
fargo or on grenache or whatever it is

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
you listen to you know

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
on previous episodes but actually this

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
year there's quite a lot to say by way

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,400
of scene setting i will try to be brief

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,080
but i just want to refer to actually

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
seven points would you believe first of

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,480
all

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
the eu strategic agenda 2019-24 says and

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,040
i quote

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
the eu needs to pursue a course of

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,239
action

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
and increase its capacity to act

90
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,959
autonomously to safeguard its interests

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,519
uphold its values and way of life and

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,080
help shape the global future

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
then in the state of union address in

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
september 2020

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,000
uh president vanderlian announced that

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,879
europe should

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
secure digital sovereignty with a common

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,879
vision of the eu

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,159
in 2030 based on clear goals

100
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,120
and principles then we have a couple of

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,440
uh

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
important letters that also um i think

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
set the scene a little bit on on the

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,239
march the first not very long ago

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760
chancellor merkel with the prime

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
ministers of denmark

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
estonia and finland wrote to the

108
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,799
president saying

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
now is the time for europe to be

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
digitally sovereign and she set out or

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
they set out three steps first of all a

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
swot analysis if you can call it that is

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
my paraphrasing

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
swot analysis of the critical

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
technologies and strategic sectors

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
um as an aside you might have read an

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,799
article in yesterday's ft

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
from pat gelsinger the ceo of intel

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
noting that 80 of the world's

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
semiconductors are now made in

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
asia and that's moved in 30 years

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,240
when at that point 30 years ago europe

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
had a 44

124
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
market share now only 10 percent

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
so the second point in the letter the

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
union must strengthen and refine its

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
policy approach for these critical

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
technologies and sectors

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
and the third point was put a monitoring

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
system in place

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,080
that followed fourth point with a letter

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
from eight member states leaders

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
slightly less detailed letter

134
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
but the letter said we share many of the

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
ideas outlined in the

136
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
chancellor merkel letter we share many

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
of the ideas and there indeed there are

138
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,000
some points we

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
find a particular importance we agree

140
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
that our agenda must be founded on a

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
good mix of self-determination and

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,759
openness and the first mention in that

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
letter of digital leadership

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,120
um then probably the fifth the following

145
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
day actually on the ninth of march

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
uh the european commission produced its

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
europe's

148
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
digital decade and set out digital

149
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
targets for 2030

150
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
and and introduced this idea of a

151
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,160
digital compass

152
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
with the four points of the compass

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
being practical plans for skills

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
infrastructure digital transformation of

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,479
business

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
and digital transformation of government

157
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,520
then

158
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
on the 24th of march perhaps by a way of

159
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,759
like keeping the commission's feet to

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,560
the fire

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,919
there was a spain netherlands non-paper

162
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
um anybody who's not from europe will

163
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
have to have that explained to them we

164
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,400
have lots of non-papers

165
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
uh in europe which are actually papers

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
and he said although the concept of

167
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,759
strategic

168
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
autonomy was linked traditionally to

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,919
european security and defense

170
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,880
the pandemic marks a turning point i

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
think that's the point made there and

172
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
last but by no means least

173
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,880
as if to keep the attention focused even

174
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,440
more

175
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,759
on the 21st of april so literally only a

176
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
few days ago the trio presidency

177
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
produced a note

178
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
called paths towards european digital

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
sovereignty

180
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
from the perspective of industrial and

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680
internal market policy so

182
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,759
that's me being able to refer to seven

183
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
points of introducing european digital

184
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
sovereignty all happening

185
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
in the last few months let me turn to

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,039
our panelists

187
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,919
uh sir julian first sir julian king you

188
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
were the european commissioner

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
for the security union until 2019. now

190
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,039
you're advising clients and working with

191
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,759
rusi

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
a very well-known think tank we'd love

193
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
to hear first of all your perspectives

194
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
on digital sovereignty and if you have a

195
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,800
moment

196
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,599
to address the major challenges ahead to

197
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,440
achieve that digital sovereignty that

198
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,400
would be excellent

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,039
so julian well thank you and it's it's

200
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,720
good to have the opportunity to be back

201
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
uh with the conference albeit uh

202
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
virtually this year

203
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,479
so uh a quick recap um

204
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
strategic autonomy as you've just

205
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,599
mentioned

206
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
um goes through those various different

207
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,599
documents it goes back to

208
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
the defense world so it's entirely

209
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
appropriate that we should be talking

210
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
about it in the context of the munich

211
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,520
security conference

212
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
where it was about the ability is about

213
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,560
the ability

214
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
and having the capabilities to act uh

215
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,720
on your own if if you need to

216
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
but with allies uh where you can but

217
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,479
it's of course

218
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,840
it's developed and grown uh as as your

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
introduction has explained uh beyond

220
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,800
defense to um

221
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,759
scarce resources supply and sustain

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,039
the tech world that we get um

223
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,919
tech and digital sovereignty uh and

224
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,120
indeed more generally

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,080
uh to various aspects of economic policy

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,440
which is where we got to

227
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
today recognizing that tech is

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
a very important part of the economy

229
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,400
in the end i think it comes down to

230
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,759
the eu and member states thinking about

231
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
how they can most effectively leverage

232
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
uh the single market which is their

233
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,360
strategic asset

234
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
uh a market of 450 million uh with

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
many millions of businesses if you

236
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
include uh small and

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
medium-sized businesses as well it is a

238
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,519
very important part of of the global

239
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,399
economy

240
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
and so the eu thinks about how to

241
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
leverage that

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,279
in two ways essentially uh

243
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
defensively uh and offensively

244
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
defensively

245
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
by uh conditioning access to that market

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
that's not new it's been done

247
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,959
in many areas before but in relation to

248
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,080
tech

249
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
that means thinking about conditions

250
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
around

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
data regulation privacy some of the

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,800
conditions for actually engaging

253
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
with that market offensively if you like

254
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
it's about about setting standards and

255
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
norms for that market

256
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
and beyond internationally and i think

257
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
both of those activities

258
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
as i say are entirely legitimate uh

259
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
you just have to be careful how you do

260
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
them and this is something we may

261
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,519
come on to in a bit more detail

262
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,120
when you're thinking about conditioning

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
access you just have to be a little bit

264
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
careful that you don't

265
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,279
tip into measures that might be

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,640
protectionist

267
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
and when you're thinking about how you

268
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
might set

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
norms and international behavior i think

270
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,519
you just have to be a little bit careful

271
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,880
about not just going it alone

272
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
because as i hope we'll discuss uh this

273
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,000
is

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
really a game where you want to work

275
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,600
with partners

276
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,959
particularly with like-minded partners

277
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,000
many of whom will be your eu

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
uh neighbors and partners but some of

279
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,519
whom

280
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
are outside of the eu so how do you

281
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,279
reach out

282
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,640
and work with them that broadly speaking

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,360
i think is the

284
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,519
is the sort of the framework of

285
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,880
strategic autonomy as

286
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
as applied to the tech sector tech

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,480
sovereignty

288
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,360
and the challenge

289
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
thank you very much julian yeah um i

290
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,839
like the categorization into defensive

291
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,160
and

292
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,959
offensive and i think your point about

293
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,480
being careful not to slip into

294
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
protectionism

295
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
um also topics we might explore

296
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
may i turn to uh dr greenberg

297
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
regine if i may call you that the

298
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
director for

299
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
cyber foreign and security policy at the

300
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,600
federal

301
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
foreign office but with extensive eu

302
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
policy

303
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
experience and background and i wondered

304
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,519
if you can perhaps develop

305
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,120
a little more the foreign policy

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
implications of europe's digital

307
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
sovereignty aspirations

308
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,079
with your own view of what you think the

309
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,519
digital sovereignty means of course

310
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
yeah thank you john um well you're

311
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
talking to a diplomat

312
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,839
and therefore you will not be surprised

313
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,880
that i

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,040
uh would uh describe digital sovereignty

315
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,000
even

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
in a in a broader um in a broader sense

317
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,519
than

318
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
what we discussed until now so in my

319
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
understanding digital sovereignty means

320
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,800
not

321
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
only that technological choices are

322
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,160
possible

323
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,680
so that the europeans own

324
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
or have access to certain critical

325
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
technologies

326
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
and that they are able to develop these

327
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,079
and innovate these technologies in a

328
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,160
economically viable way but

329
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,519
there are two more aspects

330
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,160
that i think are important the first one

331
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,800
is

332
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
digital sovereignty means also that we

333
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,079
are able to protect

334
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,600
our citizens in a digital environment

335
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,880
um this is dealing with cyber security

336
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,839
of course i.t

337
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
security and of course also preventing a

338
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
cyber war

339
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
but it is also making sure that

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
um human rights and fundamental freedoms

341
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
are also observed

342
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,720
in the digital space in cyberspace and

343
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,880
online as well as offline

344
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
and of course there is this question of

345
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
privacy and

346
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
data sovereignty and this is also part

347
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
of protecting our citizens i think this

348
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,440
is important to understand

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
and then um

350
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
also important is uh element

351
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
an important element of this concept is

352
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
that we

353
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
make sure that our eu rules are

354
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
respected

355
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,720
so first of all this is about rule

356
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
setting of course

357
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,639
but then also about rule implementation

358
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
and rule enforcement

359
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
and what you were asking me is what do

360
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
we do with our partners

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,519
of course we have to explain this

362
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
concept to our partners

363
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
get support from them explain it also to

364
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
our adversaries

365
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
and making sure that they understand

366
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
where we are heading to

367
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
we had a very good experience with the

368
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,399
gdpr so the data privacy

369
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,600
directive and this is something um

370
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
i would say this is the gold standard of

371
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
how we could do this make

372
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
our eu rules respected

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,680
and we have um a lot of

374
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,560
items on the digital agenda now and it

375
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
is really important

376
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
that we are talking about this with our

377
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
american partners before

378
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
thank you

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
thank you very much thank you very much

380
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
regine um

381
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,480
i think some good references to gdpr

382
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,959
there

383
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,399
and an example of what julian was

384
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
talking about norm setting for sure and

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
i wonder whether

386
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
the eu is about to do the same thing

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
with the ai regulation

388
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
as well our next panelist is hester

389
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,959
samson and hester

390
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,199
you also a diplomat dutch diplomat and

391
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,560
former ambassador

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,199
but recently appointed as the deputy

393
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,760
national coordinator for security

394
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,839
and town counter-terrorism and as the

395
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,440
director for

396
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
cyber security and state threats so also

397
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,920
with a background in

398
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,720
international relations um i wonder if i

399
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,199
can be

400
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
blunt does this concept of european

401
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
digital sovereignty makes sense

402
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,680
to you or does with your experience

403
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,320
should you be

404
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
should we be putting our efforts behind

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
a broader grouping of

406
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,199
like-minded states

407
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,600
thank you thank you very much uh john

408
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,639
and indeed

409
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,399
i do think that it makes a lot of sense

410
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,279
and also by you just setting the scene

411
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
with uh the seven important documents

412
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,959
that came out just recently

413
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,560
i think uh we've come to the stage that

414
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:58,880
we

415
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
really appreciate its con concept and

416
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
that's actually necessary

417
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,920
uh to become more digital uh

418
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
autonomous than we are today and i think

419
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,480
also the example that was just given by

420
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
by julian when it comes to the

421
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,160
semiconductor also that's something that

422
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,519
is

423
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,760
on top of our minds and then to see how

424
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:27,839
can you work on depending

425
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,600
i've have we lost hester

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
i can't hear you esther

427
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,880
um can everybody hear me okay yes i

428
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,759
think we might have

429
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,320
lost tessa okay well look i'm gonna um

430
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,519
come back to hester if

431
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,199
um the connection this is always the

432
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,440
challenge with these online events isn't

433
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,000
it so

434
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
if i move to um our fourth panelist tom

435
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,639
tom enders

436
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,320
uh tom um uh is this hester back online

437
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
jesse

438
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
are you back with us we lost you there

439
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,320
yeah i'm sorry i'm i'm not sure what

440
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,959
happened

441
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,079
oh no at the moment we wanted to talk a

442
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,839
bit about our uh

443
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,959
geopolitical adversary so i'm yeah

444
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
yeah that's right yeah but

445
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,040
but no i i it's good also to to take uh

446
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,560
maybe a step back on

447
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,399
on that perspective and indeed was

448
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
mentioned already a bit like uh

449
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,839
of course with other countries um and i

450
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,720
think it's it's

451
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
good to have this division in mind in

452
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
the sense that we are dealing

453
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,959
uh more with three polls in in this in

454
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,000
this sense i think

455
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
in the sense that you have of course the

456
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,839
liberal democracy the free markets

457
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
and of course us uk are extremely

458
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,880
important

459
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,160
part in that but also the authoritarian

460
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,959
state capitalism that we that we see uh

461
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,160
that's also

462
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
gaining some more influence in the world

463
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,000
that we are in today

464
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,160
on china and russia but i think also

465
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
it's very important

466
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,199
not to forget the third poll and that is

467
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,439
the uh private technology

468
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,720
companies and financial institutions uh

469
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
whose power seem to be sometimes

470
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
difficult to uh

471
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
to tame by democratic governments and i

472
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
think that's also part of this

473
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,039
digital sovereignty on how to together

474
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,599
with these companies and and provide

475
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,240
make sure that your our european values

476
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,039
uh

477
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,280
taken aboard and then indeed some of the

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
more offensive standard setting might be

479
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
a very good solution to that but i'm

480
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
sure that we'll touch upon that later

481
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
also

482
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,640
thank you hester so tom you're in a

483
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
fantastic position if i might say so

484
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,679
you're now the

485
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,360
president of the german council for

486
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
foreign relations so in the heart of

487
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
the land of diplomacy but for many years

488
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
14 years i think

489
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,880
you were the chair the ceo of airbus

490
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
and the ads and one of the things that

491
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,679
i often think is when we have these

492
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
discussions about digital sovereignty

493
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
what does that mean for business

494
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,440
decisions

495
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
how what what choices should business

496
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,200
leaders make when they

497
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,720
see and how does that affect the

498
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
business decision so

499
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
i mean this from this fantastic position

500
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
tom from a business position and from

501
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,960
being

502
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,160
uh the president so really interested to

503
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,320
hear your perspective

504
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
well thanks john i hope you don't mind

505
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,199
i'm not a diplomat but

506
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
but yes from a business from a business

507
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,919
position let me say uh while all these

508
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,760
activities we had right now in europe i

509
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,000
mean even experts i think can't keep

510
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,360
track on

511
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
all the initiatives at eu level then

512
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
at the national levels all the money the

513
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
billions that are

514
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,080
thrown to the digital sphere

515
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,440
i think the recovery facility

516
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
uh the the covet fund wants to dedicate

517
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,000
20 of a fund which is more than 600

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
billion to the so-called digital

519
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
transition

520
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,640
i sometimes that will feel that decision

521
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,679
makers

522
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,679
forget a little bit about the the

523
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,919
business sphere

524
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,360
let me say a little bit provocatively

525
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
it's very nice to have a digital compass

526
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
2003

527
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,200
but the the ordinary company

528
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
doesn't care that much about 2030 right

529
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
now it's about how do i

530
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,320
how do i improve how do i digitize uh

531
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,919
how do i build a data platform for my

532
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
company or for the for the industry

533
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,600
which i'm working in

534
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
in the next couple of years in order to

535
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
leverage everybody has understood that

536
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
in business we've understood that

537
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
already seven eight

538
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
years ago at least uh that that data

539
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,280
as volcanic said is is power

540
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,960
the data is the gold the the oil of

541
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
of yesterday and that we need to

542
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
leverage our data

543
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,280
of good of the business our products but

544
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
but also for the

545
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,240
digital services around that so um

546
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
i'm wondering sometimes with all the

547
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
initiatives whether this aspect is

548
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,840
is taken adequately into account and

549
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
then of course

550
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,840
at the very core of it uh what is

551
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
absolutely necessary and i think

552
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,559
many initiatives fortunately take that

553
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,080
into account is we need to invest into

554
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
our people

555
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
we need to invest into digital education

556
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
we need to invest

557
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,919
into into skills we must not forget

558
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,400
that if we want to build digital

559
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,200
sovereignty

560
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,960
and i don't want to discuss with termia

561
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
we need um we need a

562
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
a an environment to create create an

563
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
environment of of you know blooming

564
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,679
innovation

565
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,600
in europe innovation is at the very core

566
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
of it and when i look at my

567
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
experience with with brussels and

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,799
previous

569
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,159
initiatives uh i don't want to mention

570
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,840
the lisbon goals

571
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
uh or europe 2020 i think we can say

572
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,280
fairly

573
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,240
mixed mixed success or mixed results

574
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
horizon 2020

575
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
we had a lot of red tape much too much

576
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,039
red tape around these initiatives

577
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
very practically i remember sending

578
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
letters with other business leaders to

579
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,200
brussels say for heaven's sake

580
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
help us with all this red tape otherwise

581
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,120
we can

582
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
never leverage the money the budgets our

583
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
own funding

584
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
that would go into these initiatives so

585
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
that would

586
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,679
really under underline is important for

587
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,960
business and when it comes to to cyber

588
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
and cyber threats

589
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,200
i think we also need to need to see that

590
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
commercial companies can contribute

591
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
a lot here cyber security today if you

592
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,720
leave that to the legacy services

593
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,320
i think we're all lost we need we need

594
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
new capabilities we need advanced

595
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
capabilities and these capabilities are

596
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,679
usually not with the

597
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,400
legacy security services and the talents

598
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,919
are not with the legacy security

599
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,159
services they are with the commercial

600
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,720
businesses and here i think that the the

601
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,360
talents

602
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
the advanced capabilities of these

603
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
commercial companies

604
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,039
in europe and elsewhere i mean no

605
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,640
problem if we can

606
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,520
leverage u.s capabilities here if these

607
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
a certain a certain our our goals um

608
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
this is not adequately taken care of

609
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
right now i stopped here john

610
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,480
thanks tom um you make some uh very good

611
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
points and you move us nicely into the

612
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,919
cyber security aspects

613
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,320
i mean hester you're relatively recently

614
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
appointed into this

615
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
cyber role after many years as you know

616
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,960
as a

617
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,280
and a very senior diplomat in your your

618
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,320
country i mean

619
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,640
what does when you think about digital

620
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,559
sovereignty and cyber what does it mean

621
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,159
to you what are the implications

622
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,840
for the role that you have

623
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,679
well maybe also a reasoned

624
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,480
example when we had the microsoft

625
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
exchange hack

626
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,120
i think that has affected many of us and

627
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
earlier on also solar winds was already

628
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
uh already mentioned by colleagues in

629
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,840
the panel

630
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
and the question then of course is what

631
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
can we do what can we do to protect our

632
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,440
citizens what can we do to protect

633
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
the companies um and and part that

634
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:22,960
should

635
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
buy i think a certification scheme in uh

636
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,720
in the eu

637
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
and although the cyber security act

638
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
mentions that

639
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
trying to lift also the security of

640
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
these software products

641
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,559
but then of course you have to have a

642
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,320
proper discussion also with these

643
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,159
companies and also about what is the

644
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,679
liability

645
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,840
from companies software producing

646
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,039
companies

647
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,919
to other companies that use them if you

648
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,120
want to bring in a car

649
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
in the european union you have to adhere

650
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
to the highest security standard

651
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
and that of course something a bit

652
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,720
different in this

653
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,360
field and i would say that as as a

654
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
european union

655
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,880
you really have to be able to set those

656
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,159
standards as well

657
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
you cannot ask from a small or

658
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
medium-sized company

659
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,200
to have their cyber security

660
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
top notch like we expect from banks for

661
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
instance

662
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,159
but then how can such a company provide

663
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,320
for its its own security that is partly

664
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,600
the standard setting

665
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,159
that is of course also by i think being

666
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:24,640
more

667
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,080
aware of these risks of supply chain

668
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,360
uh that that are there um and also

669
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
how uh can we make sure when there is an

670
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
interaction between

671
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,400
uh maybe uh state actors

672
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
and and criminal actors how can you deal

673
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,919
with that uh

674
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
it was earlier on mentioned also i think

675
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,279
by the commissioner that we have now

676
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,640
this eu sanction

677
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,600
package also on possible

678
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,840
mail the use of cyber by somebody

679
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
it's not it's really focused on on

680
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,039
entities

681
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,559
but this is something i think where we

682
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
should have the whole of government

683
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,039
approach

684
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,960
within the eu to make sure that you have

685
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,080
this security at hand

686
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,039
unmute myself um if i can move to eu

687
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,480
regime and pick up on that i mean some

688
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,279
of what

689
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,400
esther describes there doesn't need i i

690
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,840
might argue doesn't need digital

691
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
sovereignty for europe what it needs is

692
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
europe to cooperate as one block you

693
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,320
know in the way that it does

694
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
through anissa and another you know

695
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,720
member state structures i mean what

696
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
what more does it need than what it

697
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
already has to sort of operate

698
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
as one block essentially when it comes

699
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,559
to

700
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,640
sharing best practice and you know

701
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,320
up-to-date intelligence and so on why

702
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,200
doesn't he ditch

703
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,880
why does it need digital sovereignty

704
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
well of course we have very good

705
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
preconditions in europe

706
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
because for example in cyber security we

707
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,520
master the whole stack from

708
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,039
research to i.t security firms of course

709
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,760
this is

710
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,559
this these are good preconditions but it

711
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
it means also that we have to

712
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
to preserve this for the future which

713
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,559
means that we have to have the ability

714
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,760
to innovate

715
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,159
and innovation is um is is just um

716
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
secure or secured if you have also the

717
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,120
possibility to market the pro that

718
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,799
brought the product that you are

719
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,679
innovating

720
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,039
so um i think this is an important

721
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,720
uh an important aspect most of what we

722
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,279
see

723
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
in cyber security incidents are of

724
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
course cyber crime but we have also a

725
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
considerable

726
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,320
and increasing number of uh of state

727
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
actors or state-sponsored actors

728
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,080
who are targeting european

729
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,679
critical infrastructure public

730
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
institutions companies of course

731
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,840
and also individuals so this is

732
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,279
something

733
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,320
where we need to develop

734
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
specific capabilities and i'm talking

735
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,880
of course about civil protection but i'm

736
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
also talking about military capabilities

737
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
and this is something where we

738
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,480
are just at the start at the moment

739
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,640
thank you regine um peter i will come to

740
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,679
you in a moment and ask

741
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,159
if there are synthesis or questions from

742
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,360
the audience but

743
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
um so julian i wondered if i could come

744
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,600
to you um

745
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
when you were you were the commissioner

746
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
for three years and you were responsible

747
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,559
for the security union

748
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,679
was digital sovereignty like top of your

749
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,520
list or were there other instruments and

750
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,000
uh

751
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
other approaches that you could use to

752
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,880
make europe a player in cyber security

753
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,279
you know

754
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,720
basically make europe secure

755
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,440
well when i came into the role uh you'll

756
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,159
remember

757
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
2015 2016 uh there'd been a wave of

758
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,679
horrible terrorist attacks across europe

759
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,399
so

760
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,200
uh that was uh at that time the top

761
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,159
priority

762
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,799
but the cyber security when went up the

763
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,960
agenda very very fast

764
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
uh on both sides of the atlantic i think

765
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
uh because of um some of the big

766
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,279
uh attacks we've we've mentioned them

767
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,279
already attacks like wannacry and not

768
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,320
picture

769
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
because of the boom unfortunately in in

770
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,440
cyber crime

771
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
which has continued uh we've already

772
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,360
heard some of the statistics about that

773
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,559
i mean it's costing

774
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,159
it's costing over one percent of global

775
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,440
gdp by some by some estimates now

776
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,760
because of illegal activities and

777
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,279
illegal content

778
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,240
uh online uh child going from child

779
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,679
sexual exploitation content

780
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,159
through to through to terrorist content

781
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:38,720
because

782
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,279
of uh allegations and in some cases

783
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,799
beyond allegations

784
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,279
of political uh interference in

785
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
intellectual processes

786
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,320
and because of a growing awareness uh

787
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
again both sides of the atlantic about

788
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,440
the need

789
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,840
to better protect our critical digital

790
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,960
infrastructure

791
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,559
one example of which was the big debate

792
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,880
around 5g so there are a whole series of

793
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,600
factors that

794
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
that force this agenda uh forward

795
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,320
okay well i'm on can i make one comment

796
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
going back to what wolfgang ishinger

797
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,320
said in

798
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,039
in in his introduction he underlined the

799
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,000
importance of thinking about

800
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
transatlantic cooperation on

801
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
on these issues and i i think he's

802
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
absolutely right

803
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
uh it it should be you know it should be

804
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,320
pretty clear

805
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,159
that at least when um the context is the

806
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,559
shared strategic challenge of china not

807
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,200
just

808
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,919
but china uh we ought to be thinking

809
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,200
about some of these issues

810
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,000
uh together uh but but sometimes it's

811
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,640
difficult

812
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,440
uh the proposed eu us tech council

813
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
hasn't hasn't kicked off yet

814
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
i hope it does soon when it does kick

815
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,720
off it's going to have to deal with some

816
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,039
of the

817
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,720
some of the differences of approach the

818
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
differences approach within europe but

819
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,960
also between europe and west

820
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
over digital tax regulation and the

821
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,320
balance between regulation and

822
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,240
and uh innovation uh and attitudes to

823
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
to privacy uh not that either not that

824
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,600
anybody

825
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,320
um ignores privacy but where do you put

826
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,159
it and how do you balance it

827
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,720
so those are those are sometimes

828
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
challenging

829
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,279
subjects to discuss together but one

830
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
thing that definitely should unite us

831
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,039
and this is where i come back to your

832
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,240
question

833
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,880
is is the cyber security challenge there

834
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
is no reason at all that i can see why

835
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,399
we should not be able to work

836
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,840
effectively together

837
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,960
uh and uh i i wouldn't be i wouldn't be

838
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,600
um

839
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,039
i wouldn't be a brit if i didn't mention

840
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
also with other like-minded countries

841
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,320
like the uk

842
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
on the cyber security challenges so

843
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
actually i see cyber security in an odd

844
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,080
way

845
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,439
as a bit of an opportunity here

846
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,320
thank you thank you very much julian so

847
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,679
uh peter um

848
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,840
if you can hear me are there um is there

849
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,720
a sort of

850
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
summary of great questions from this

851
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,159
brilliant audience that you've

852
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,640
lined up

853
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,840
i'm hoping you can hear me yes i i

854
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
i

855
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,360
i hear you uh uh john thank you um we

856
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,880
are we are looking for ques

857
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,559
we are looking for questions so if

858
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,440
meanwhile you

859
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,200
there's a question by tyson parker i

860
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,120
don't know you see that in the chat

861
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,720
yeah okay well thank you tyson we'll

862
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
maybe we'll come to that

863
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,840
in a moment i'd quite like if i could to

864
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,120
stay on this uh

865
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,000
international theme for a moment i mean

866
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and turn to tom uh

867
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
tom we we we fall into this i mean i

868
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
i think we fall into this analysis at

869
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,640
the moment that um the bad

870
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,159
administration looks hopeful and

871
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,080
transatlantic relations will get going

872
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,320
and you know and and everything will be

873
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,760
will look a lot better and in the

874
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
meantime

875
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,279
um we sort of we see china as a

876
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,120
increasingly large threat

877
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,720
but is that how business sees the world

878
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,000
well i think that um i mean we could

879
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,440
we could even question our headline um

880
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
whether we are building what a digital

881
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,240
sovereignty in a multipolar world or

882
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,440
are we not uh increasingly going back

883
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
into a

884
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
bipolar world i mean the u.s and china

885
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,200
are the big

886
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,039
big elephants and then europe has to

887
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,960
look for its place in the middle

888
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,720
i think we we cannot and should not

889
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,960
assume that we have

890
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,679
a sunshine scenario with the americans

891
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,679
now for the next 50 years or something i

892
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,640
mean maybe

893
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
biden i hope is not is is just an

894
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,000
interplay before

895
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
the borders get again the transatlantic

896
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,320
wars is getting troubled

897
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,200
uh we don't we don't know that but uh

898
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,559
picking up on what julian

899
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,240
and um and regine said i think we cannot

900
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
possibly

901
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,360
begin talking about digital sovereignty

902
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,120
as long as we have a situation

903
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
in europe in the eu and its member

904
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
states where

905
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,519
we are not even able to deter

906
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,120
um state sponsored cyber attacks

907
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,320
or criminal particularly ransomware

908
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,799
attacks today we have no doctrine of

909
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,880
retaliation and this is very different

910
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,760
from

911
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
from the from the u.s with its

912
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
persistent engagement

913
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,640
doctrine i.e that allows also for

914
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,480
preemptive

915
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,519
cyber attack and i think if i may say so

916
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,440
john also with the national cyber force

917
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
that the uk has stood up

918
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
some five months ago i think as a as a

919
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,399
priority from a practical point of view

920
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,039
before we

921
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,039
get something big going in the eu i

922
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,960
would much rather see

923
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,159
france and germany working together plus

924
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,720
the uk why should that not be possible

925
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,360
uk is all the eu but the uk is still

926
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,159
in nato these three nations would really

927
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,279
integrate

928
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,720
and coordinate their cyber capabilities

929
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
and that is the whole range and develop

930
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,480
a persistent engagement

931
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,039
doctrine i think we would be far better

932
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,799
off and the the other point i wanted to

933
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,440
make is

934
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,960
we jumped perhaps a little bit too

935
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
quickly to the hardcore cybersecurity

936
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
at djip we have just done a

937
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,960
comprehensive report

938
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,079
which we call europe's capacity

939
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,639
to act in the global tech race because

940
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,159
we didn't want to talk about

941
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,119
digital sovereignty um and we've been

942
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,079
looking at five

943
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,639
key technology areas that is artificial

944
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,760
intelligence

945
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,440
uh cloud computing semiconductors

946
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,639
5g 6g mobile networks

947
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
and quantum computing we could certainly

948
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,079
add

949
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,560
other areas but all these areas are

950
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
areas where europe needs to catch up

951
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,839
probably the least

952
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,239
um or europe is best positioned in the

953
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,159
mobile networks through nokia

954
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,280
and and ericsson and has a chance also

955
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,040
in quantum technologies

956
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,599
but all these areas also feed into cyber

957
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,239
security

958
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,879
in other words if you don't have a a

959
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,920
significant

960
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,800
innovative potential in the european

961
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,599
union

962
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,640
that hampers that that necessarily

963
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,359
limits your ability to produce cyber

964
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,079
security

965
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
in the years ahead 2030 or whatever

966
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,520
thank you very much tom hester let me

967
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,760
come come back to you i'm from what

968
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,040
you've just been hearing from

969
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,880
uh julian and uh tom there i mean

970
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
what what comments would you make on the

971
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,160
sort of observations

972
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,960
uh that they've just uh told us about

973
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440
well thank you very much john and and

974
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,119
indeed i i do think that in certain

975
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,000
areas we have

976
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
we have to catch up and in other areas

977
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,680
we have to make sure that we stay

978
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,160
ahead of the game um and one of the

979
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,079
things that is done extremely important

980
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,240
is the emerging european data spaces

981
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,320
you need to be able to work with data in

982
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,870
all these different fields that

983
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,040
[Music]

984
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,320
tom just just mentioned also and

985
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,160
there we have uh hardly any

986
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,119
uh uh players ourselves so this is

987
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,480
really something where i think you

988
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
should uh

989
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,079
join hands and and see how we can how we

990
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,280
can work on that

991
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
and that's really uh trying to to set up

992
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,680
own cloud systems but it's maybe also

993
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,599
again going back to regulations

994
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,920
like how can the data be shared and

995
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,680
under what conditions

996
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,520
and i think it's it's these kind of so

997
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,720
moving on to the next steps uh

998
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,480
where we really can get into the

999
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,000
practicality of things and what's

1000
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
actually needed

1001
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,280
and how then to work together uh with

1002
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
partners but also make sure that

1003
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
we will be able to make our own

1004
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,359
decisions once

1005
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
once that's absolutely necessary of

1006
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
course preferably with partners

1007
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
but to a certain extent also when when

1008
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,079
necessary by

1009
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,079
buyers and there it's really where we

1010
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
think we have to

1011
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,040
make additional steps and and encourage

1012
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,680
uh

1013
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
also i think this corporation the

1014
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,720
private sector

1015
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,839
uh the uh knowledge uh base uh that we

1016
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,560
have

1017
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,880
so our universities are extremely well

1018
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,240
prepared for this also

1019
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
but we should continue to support them

1020
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
and come together in this triple helix

1021
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,839
and make sure that

1022
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,400
we we use the advantages that are at

1023
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
hand also

1024
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
well i think sabine introduced the fact

1025
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,839
that

1026
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,280
one of the things i'm involved with is

1027
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
the commission european commission's

1028
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,000
intelligence

1029
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,920
cities challenge and i love it because

1030
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,160
i'm working with european cities across

1031
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,880
europe

1032
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,960
and that triple helix in fact they we

1033
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,440
refer to as the quadruple helix as well

1034
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
with civil society i mean it's so

1035
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,359
critical to the success of cities as

1036
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:35,680
they

1037
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,480
attempt to uh digitalize and modernize

1038
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
i'm absolutely with you on that listen

1039
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,880
we've got a

1040
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
a couple of minutes left and it would be

1041
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,320
appropriate if i think

1042
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
if i asked you each for your one or two

1043
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,560
things maybe one thing

1044
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,920
that you you think is critical to um

1045
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,880
europe achieving uh some sort of digital

1046
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,480
sovereignty in the way that we described

1047
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,280
it so

1048
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,079
um maybe i can turn to julian first and

1049
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,720
then

1050
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,839
regine next so what's the one one thing

1051
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,480
uh julian

1052
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
so there's one thing that's that's

1053
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,599
critical which has already come up in

1054
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,880
the discussions and in some of the

1055
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,000
speeches

1056
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and that is a really serious effort on

1057
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,240
investment but there's one comment

1058
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,480
not perhaps critical but which i'd like

1059
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,280
to make

1060
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,880
uh which is picking up something tom

1061
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
just said which is

1062
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,320
um yes let's find a way on these issues

1063
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,480
the site the broad family of cyber

1064
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
issues

1065
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,040
of also cooperating with with the uk

1066
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
the uk has left the european union but

1067
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
it is still a neighbor

1068
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,920
and on these issues a strong partner uh

1069
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,480
some of

1070
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,720
this cooperation will migrate to nato or

1071
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,920
elsewhere but

1072
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
actually a good deal of it a lot of it

1073
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,960
is rightly done through the european

1074
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,640
union because the european union has the

1075
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,760
right mix

1076
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
of policies and capabilities and

1077
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,640
partners to advance this agenda in the

1078
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
way that

1079
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,599
we we've all been discussing and

1080
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,119
actually over the last few years

1081
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,320
um there's been good uk input on these

1082
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
issues both on the cyber crime side

1083
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,359
uh some of the hardcore side the

1084
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,000
security

1085
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,359
issues and on resilience and so i hope

1086
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,560
we'd be able to find a way of keeping

1087
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,000
that cooperation going

1088
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,359
let's hope so julian and regine uh last

1089
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,400
quick comment from you yeah uh

1090
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,320
let me say i would like to see the

1091
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,760
digital sovereignty

1092
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,079
not so much as a state to be reached but

1093
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,880
more a working method that we follow

1094
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,640
very good thought very good thought and

1095
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,879
tom

1096
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,119
you're on me okay yeah i think i

1097
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,560
mentioned that already i think it's high

1098
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,040
time

1099
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,599
that the the eu or at least member

1100
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,480
states

1101
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,160
uh the coalition of the willing

1102
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,119
yeah start seriously developing

1103
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,000
seriously

1104
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,040
persistent uh persistent engagement

1105
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,400
doctrine on cyber

1106
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
secondly innovation innovation

1107
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
innovation and ask what industry really

1108
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
needs and the eu should not be tempted

1109
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,000
to put

1110
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,280
too much emphasis on regulation because

1111
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,440
if you do that you might strangle

1112
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
innovation that you need tomorrow in the

1113
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,720
yeah and at least

1114
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,560
correlation i think between innovation

1115
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,640
and regulation is not yet

1116
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,880
what it should be i mean i think it's

1117
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,920
it's not always

1118
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,880
closely uh correlated and i think these

1119
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,400
are the points i'd like to make

1120
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
so we leave the last the last thought to

1121
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,200
you hester

1122
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,040
thank you very much well big big burden

1123
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
on my shoulder but i i think indeed you

1124
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,880
mentioned earlier this swot analysis

1125
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,079
that we have to do

1126
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,240
and i think really it's also down to the

1127
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,599
granularity of things

1128
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,400
uh yeah i think first of all we would

1129
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,319
like to preserve our opening

1130
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,160
that's how we got our wealth that's why

1131
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
many of the european countries produce

1132
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,640
the happiest

1133
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,960
kids in the world so we have to preserve

1134
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,480
that then you have to have a certain

1135
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,319
amount of granularity to see where you

1136
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,040
have to

1137
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
uh be more uh independent and make sure

1138
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,200
that if there is a dependency

1139
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,720
that that one is balanced and that you

1140
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
can leverage it

1141
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,319
thank you very much esther can i end by

1142
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,800
