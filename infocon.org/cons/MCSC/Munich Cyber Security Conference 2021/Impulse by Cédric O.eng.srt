1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,520
i'm really happy to have the opportunity

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,319
to

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,440
talk in front of you today and to tackle

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,559
that issue that is

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,679
uh of growing concern among on

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,920
among our democracies which is the the

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,279
rising cyber threats

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,600
what we saw for instance in france in

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,960
2020

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,080
is that the number of cyber attacks that

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,720
have been

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,039
aiming at france have been multiplied by

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,840
four

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,599
between 2019 and 2020.

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,840
this is embodying the fact that this is

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
a growing concern and this is concerning

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,280
everybody

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,399
companies local authorities citizens

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
government hospitals in 2020

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
and the french hospitals underwent 27

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,760
major cyber attacks so this is a growing

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,399
concerns

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
and the response should be a common

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,920
response

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
what we have to do is first to

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
strengthen the awareness of our

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
societies of our companies especially

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
the small and medium businesses

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,400
but also of our institutions and our

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,199
governments

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
we need everybody to be aware that

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,560
everybody

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
can be a target this is why in france we

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
have been

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,400
implementing a comprehensive national

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,759
strategy

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,640
which will be fostering investment but

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,600
which will be

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
also bringing about a public investment

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
investment of 1.3 billion euros

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
over the coming years in order to first

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,200
raise the awareness of our societies

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
among citizens

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
among companies among small and medium

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,520
businesses

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
among institutions we need everybody to

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
raise its awareness and its preparation

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
level second to invest into technology

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
we need to strengthen our technological

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,399
preparation

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
we need to have the tools to put in

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,479
front of the threats

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
and this is why we will be fostering

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
startups big companies

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,360
investment in r d in order to prepare

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,399
the tool for

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
tomorrow but we also want to raise

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
the preparation of the institution and

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
the tools of the institution

60
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,199
especially through the preparation of

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
ansi a transnational the security system

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
deformation

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,360
or national agency for the security of

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
information

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
system because there is also an issue

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
about the governmental

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
response we need at the end of the day

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
to foster two cooperation the first one

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,959
is a cooperation between

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,360
the public sector and the private sector

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
the response if you want

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
it to be systemic needs to be a common

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
response that is commonly designed

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
and that is fostering and that is well

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
based on the the capacity and the

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
the research and development and the

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
know-how of the private sector

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
but also in good cooperation with the

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
institution especially especially the

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
security

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,959
institution we need also to foster the

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
european cooperation

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
we have begun under the responsibility

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,159
of thierry proton

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
to build that european strategy of cyber

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,000
security

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
but we need to do and to go faster in

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,319
order to identify the threats

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,200
in order to share the knowledge and the

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
know-how in order to share

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
what we know about the threats what we

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
know about the current attack

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
and the response that we know that are

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,159
working

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,159
we need to foster the cooperation

96
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
between states between member states

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
between our agencies because the threat

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,799
is global

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,440
and the attackers are global and we need

100
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,080
to

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
to foster and to be able to set up

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
a common response i do think that this

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
is one of the main challenges that our

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,319
democracy is

105
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
facing because there is an economic

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
issue

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
there is obviously a sovereign issue but

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
there is also a democratic

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
issue with what we saw during the

110
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
previous election in our democratic

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,360
countries and the influence that those

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
cyber threats

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,560
can create within our elections thank

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
you very much for having me

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
today and i do think this is a

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
discussion that will go on

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:15,840
in the coming years

118
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,430
