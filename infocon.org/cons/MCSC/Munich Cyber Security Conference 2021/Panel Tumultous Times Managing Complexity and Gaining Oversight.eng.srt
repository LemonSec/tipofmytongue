00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,919
a few thank you all for joining and i

178
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,560
will

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,599
start right away um by posing the first

180
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,319
question

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,440
to the whole panel um

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,759
cyber security becomes more and more

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,039
complex

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,840
based on the increasing

185
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,560
interconnectivity

186
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
and also by facing a very large and

187
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
challenging

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,960
threat surface recently and i'm just

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,919
mentioning

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
um what we heard before from solarwinds

191
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
to hapnium

192
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,199
major nation-state attacks have been

193
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
in the public eye and of course

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
during the kovic 19 pandemic

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,199
strategic attacks on healthcare

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,720
organization and my question

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
to you is do we see a new quality

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,759
of exploiting vulnerabilities because of

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,160
this

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
increasing complexity and it's a large

201
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,319
and challenging

202
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,000
risk and threat surface we are facing

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,479
marked by continuity or change

204
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
especially when it comes to attack

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,120
vectors

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
are they actually new or not

207
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
starting with bettina happy to go first

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,039
so thanks madeline first for the

209
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
introduction and happy to be here

210
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,840
well i would certainly say we see

211
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,599
a new uh way of how we look at cyber

212
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
the attacks if you just look at the way

213
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
ransomware attacks

214
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,759
increased drastically over the past two

215
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,479
years

216
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,960
you can clearly see that we are in a new

217
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
and a new area when it

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
comes to how to deal with this situation

219
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,599
so certainly i would um

220
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
echo yes this is a new way and it will

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
not go away even after pandemic

222
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
because we have our allianz global risk

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
report which we issue every year

224
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
and we can clearly see cyber has been

225
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,279
coming up over the past two three years

226
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
two three years drastically together

227
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,560
with business interruption

228
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
as a key threat from all the risk

229
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,920
managers

230
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
but now with the pandemic this is

231
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
certainly something which is very unique

232
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,399
and special

233
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,959
but even after the pandemic you can see

234
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
that you know the dynamics

235
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,320
and the the the business of cyber crime

236
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
has really issued and brought us to a

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
new level and this will not go away

238
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,600
certainly even after the pandemic

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,720
next online jurgen setzer

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,480
thank you for having the opportunity

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,800
i would not consider the attack vectors

242
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,780
entirely new

243
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,200
[Music]

244
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,360
however i see two developments

245
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,040
concerning a new quality of exploiting

246
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,320
vulnerabilities

247
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
the first attackers look

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
from my perspective for increasingly

249
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,399
artful ways

250
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
to distribute their malware instead of

251
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,560
targeting

252
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,600
like in former times the original aim

253
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,480
malware malware is inserted into supply

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,279
chain

255
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,399
in an early stage and what that means we

256
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
know about it

257
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,080
secondly until

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,720
a few years ago attackers were content

259
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,240
to use one single attack vector today we

260
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
don't see one single attack vector

261
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,200
we see a combination of attack vectors

262
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,839
to one target

263
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
and that had also impact

264
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
and i said i have

265
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,240
two uh two developments but i would

266
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,760
adjust one third one

267
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
and we observe that effects

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
spill more and more over

269
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
the borders of cyber for example

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
doxing sensitive personal data is stolen

271
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
as we know it then published in social

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
media for everyone to see cyber

273
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,320
and cyber is quickly not the only domain

274
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
affected

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
from my perspective more and more the

276
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
information domain is as well affected

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,279
and that haven't been seen in the past

278
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,200
so coming back to the question

279
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,440
increasingly artful ways to distribute

280
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
malware and to the combination of attack

281
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,560
vectors

282
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,279
the spillover effect and the information

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,040
into the information domain

284
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
for me is the most remarkable

285
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,880
current developments uh in terms of

286
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,839
complexity

287
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
thank you very much i think that's the

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,560
perfect link over to sandra

289
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
to give her to give us her thoughts on

290
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
the question

291
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
thank you so much for the opportunity to

292
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
speak in with this distinguished panel

293
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
in my role we have the blessing and the

294
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,120
curse

295
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
of forensically analyzing attacks

296
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
around the world and so for us it's not

297
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
theoretical and it's not a mystery

298
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
who is behind them and we know with the

299
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
solarwinds attack the us government has

300
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,560
said it was russian sponsored and with

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
hafnium it was chinese sponsored and the

302
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,959
reason

303
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,279
i mention that is we have to remember

304
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,000
that

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,399
this is not a technology problem this is

306
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,079
a political problem

307
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,200
we have across the world relationships

308
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
are at all time lows

309
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,839
between even allies and with adversaries

310
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,639
and geopolitical events beget cyber

311
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,920
events

312
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
and so what we have seen in the changes

313
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
of the actual tactics

314
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
i agree with my colleagues and that we

315
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,440
haven't seen

316
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
specifically new tactics what we have

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,639
seen is

318
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
more audacity we have seen broader scale

319
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
targeting we have seen a recklessness

320
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,320
and a disregard for

321
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
some of the safeties and protocols that

322
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
are inserted into our software

323
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,440
infrastructure and in in addition to

324
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,839
that

325
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,399
you know as an example with hafnium so

326
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,079
many web shells were dropped

327
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,240
as they were being discovered that they

328
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
put thousands and thousands of other

329
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
organizations at risk we watched after

330
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,639
the hafnium attack

331
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,360
many other threat actors come to use the

332
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,839
same

333
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
uh the same vulnerabilities that had

334
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,519
been initially

335
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
uh put in so i think that yes

336
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,440
the the tactics are very similar the

337
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
audacity and breadth are different

338
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,839
but we will not solve this in the cyber

339
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,880
security domain

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
we will solve this diplomatically or not

341
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
at all

342
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,680
thank you very much also for pointing to

343
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,800
the political

344
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
dimension of the problem and i think and

345
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,279
this is something that yuan

346
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,160
might be able to complete uh from his

347
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,560
perspective as well especially by having

348
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200
a nissan european union perspective in

349
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
mind

350
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,079
thank you i would like to echo some of

351
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,240
the thoughts of my co-panelists

352
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
saying that i mean if you look at for

353
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
example the risks and supply

354
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,079
chain security that's nothing new the

355
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,600
european threat landscape

356
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
that anisa compiles every year been

357
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,360
pointing at this since 2018 we had it in

358
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,680
2019 we hacked in 2020

359
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,480
no surprise we'll have it also in 2021.

360
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,279
the fact that

361
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
cyber threats have become more

362
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,399
sophisticated more complex more hybrid

363
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,519
is also not something new so i mean the

364
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
question really is there

365
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
uh have we adjusted our

366
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,079
tools and responses accordingly

367
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,959
it is clear that this spillover effect

368
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,639
that major general talked about that

369
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
is really serious and i would like i

370
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
would like to also

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
emphasize that it's not one magic

372
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,920
bullet that solves the problem and it's

373
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,199
not only

374
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,000
one source of the problem either and i

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
mean looking from the technology point

376
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
of view we are far from

377
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
security by design or security by

378
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
default in our supply chains

379
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,839
so i wouldn't say it's uh it's the it's

380
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,600
a problem of this domain or the other

381
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,320
domain or this world or the other domain

382
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
everybody has to uh get their act

383
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,519
together

384
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,760
and make the world better in this sense

385
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
thank you very much you actually opened

386
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
the perfect floor to ask

387
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,000
you um a follow-up question yuan

388
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,440
um i know when you started um

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
you were in your new position as

390
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,880
director

391
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
um you stated well the vision for the

392
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,480
agency from your perspective um

393
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,760
rests on two pillars uh the nis

394
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,560
directive

395
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
and the cyber security act where you

396
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,839
were of course been involved

397
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,240
tremendously um well we have seen

398
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,279
the nis been on the review um the

399
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,360
2.0 version is you know

400
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,920
on the run and of course we have the new

401
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
cyber security strategy of the european

402
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,120
union

403
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
um from your perspective um

404
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
what are the major renewals and takeoffs

405
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
um and um

406
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
you know incidents the you know

407
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,800
insensitives

408
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,240
the these strategy and review processes

409
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,720
have

410
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,279
produced over time in terms of tackling

411
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,639
complexity

412
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,880
and fostering cyber resilience in the

413
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
european union

414
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
thanks very much for the question um

415
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
it's a whole potato

416
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
uh i would also add a third pillar now

417
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
it's not only the network information

418
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
security directive and cyber security

419
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
act we also now have the research

420
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,880
innovation pillar so the competence

421
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
center and network

422
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
which has recently been adopted by the

423
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,839
co-legislators in europe and i think

424
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,600
it's a very very important pillar that

425
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,480
will

426
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
strengthen our arm of

427
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
not only cyber knowledge but also

428
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,199
resilience

429
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
in a long-term perspective and i think

430
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,320
it's also very important

431
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,360
because it emphasizes the

432
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,519
interconnectedness

433
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,639
between the the society and economy with

434
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,120
the

435
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
the sector of technology and innovation

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,519
so when you look at the uh the you know

437
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,839
the question of whether we have the resp

438
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,079
right tools in place uh whether we have

439
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,360
the right direction

440
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,759
uh that we can follow i think the 5g

441
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
risk assessment the europe managed to to

442
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
put together

443
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
collectively and then develop the

444
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,880
toolbox

445
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,240
to to to mitigate the risks

446
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,679
stemming from this assessment i think

447
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
that was a very important

448
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,559
milestone and it also points the way

449
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
forward

450
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,160
and indeed if you look at the new

451
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
proposal from the european commission

452
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,760
regarding the review of the nis

453
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,799
directive

454
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,400
it already indicates a possibility

455
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
for sector specific risk assessments and

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,880
i think that's

457
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,120
uh that's very uh

458
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
kind of a normal route for for europe to

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,559
take

460
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,559
the big vendors the big suppliers they

461
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,080
regard europe as a

462
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
as a single marketplace rightly so

463
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
so also a response when it comes to

464
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
potential risks and how to

465
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
handle these risks it needs to be

466
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
coordinated so the collaboration and

467
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,880
coordination

468
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,840
is something that the nis ii will

469
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,640
strengthen

470
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
it's also something that is

471
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
intrinsically there when

472
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
when it comes to the new cyber security

473
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
strategy the commission has put forward

474
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,679
the idea of the cyber shield

475
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,559
which is essentially a way how we can

476
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:14,960
share

477
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,480
information between the public and

478
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
private sector about private sector

479
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,039
internally as well i think it is also

480
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,679
very important when it comes to

481
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,720
the the uh the response to the risks

482
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,440
but i mean ultimately it is about

483
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
coordinating our

484
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
our activities making sure that we have

485
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,400
we share the same understanding of the

486
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
risks and we also share the same

487
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
understanding of what would be the

488
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,120
tools that could be employed case by

489
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,160
case

490
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,559
and of course every member state is is a

491
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
bit different so that means that they

492
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
can adjust

493
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,360
the responses as necessary but we need a

494
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,799
common methodology

495
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,240
that we can that can use so that the

496
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
single market also has a single response

497
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,280
to vendors

498
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,559
and and providers

499
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
thank you very much um i think

500
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,919
especially

501
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,679
you know pointing to common

502
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,600
methodologies um

503
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
and um risk assessments in terms of the

504
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
european perspective

505
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
is kind of something that i would like

506
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,640
to also

507
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
um give to the rest of the panels um

508
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
maybe sanra and bettina first um what

509
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
are your

510
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,520
maybe especially takes on this specific

511
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
issue of

512
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
you know managing the complexity um

513
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,480
and you know maneuvering through the new

514
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
vulnerabilities we are seeing

515
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
um from your perspective from the

516
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
insurance perspective

517
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,600
and uh of course from a threat

518
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
intelligence perspective

519
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
somewhere maybe i go first and please

520
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,280
you determine

521
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,919
okay so yeah i guess actually the first

522
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,240
message here has to be i think you got

523
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,720
to have a very comprehensive

524
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
holistic risk management in place in the

525
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
first place

526
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
so that's a very important piece i know

527
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
that you know there are different

528
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,559
components

529
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,880
methods tools and i think the challenge

530
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
here clearly what we see

531
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,120
is given the speed of technology changes

532
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
giving the you know the the advantage

533
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,039
probably hacker

534
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
with their tools and their way of of

535
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,480
penetrating us

536
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,039
is increasing drastically day by day you

537
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,000
got to keep this

538
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
actually updated basically on a very

539
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,000
very regular basis

540
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
and this is really including all

541
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
measurements you could think of to

542
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
really make sure you have a holistic

543
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
risk management in place this is what we

544
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,000
really realize as an insurer being you

545
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,720
know one of the

546
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
the largest cyber insurer we analyze of

547
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,039
course what we see from claims coming

548
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,760
forward

549
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,559
and in some areas it's really still very

550
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,280
interesting

551
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,679
and maybe it i can also speak at it at

552
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,559
it from an i.t

553
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
perspective to see that basics are not

554
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
in place

555
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,960
so it's really not always the highly

556
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
sophisticated having a ai

557
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
data capabilities in place already it's

558
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,720
really sometimes the basics are not

559
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
in you know introduced in companies so

560
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,159
that's why

561
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
you have to have really a proper

562
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
judgment on

563
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
both sides of the scale in the sense of

564
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
what costs

565
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,039
is it if i lose data if i get liable

566
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,120
for losing data if i get a business

567
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,000
interruption what's that causing to my

568
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
personal or company risk judgment and

569
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,679
risk profile

570
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
but also what investments are valid to

571
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,200
take into employees

572
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
into education into the i.t basics to

573
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
really make sure that you know you treat

574
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
toxic components super severely super

575
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,679
rigorous

576
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,240
that you treat um basics like patch

577
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,200
management

578
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
i don't know you know network

579
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,360
segregations it's a lot of basic things

580
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,440
which we still see when we look into our

581
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,200
claims um

582
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
what's not in place and i think that's

583
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
that's actually

584
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,039
the the very important piece to achieve

585
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
as a company that you have a rigorous

586
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,760
end-to-end risk management in place

587
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,559
judging

588
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,480
what this is doing to you and where do

589
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,919
you need to really invest

590
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
to actually keep up with the pace which

591
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,440
we see out

592
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,840
and outside due to the new technologies

593
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,640
coming forward

594
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,280
and to follow up i would say that i

595
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,760
agree

596
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,880
that for commodity threats and most

597
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,799
um most of the hacks that we respond to

598
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,880
um we have found that it was because

599
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
somebody clicked on something

600
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
they should not have clicked on which is

601
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
seems very basic but that continues to

602
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,960
be

603
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,120
one of the biggest reasons why we will

604
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
get called in to respond to breaches

605
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
that being said when you're dealing with

606
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,960
a highly sophisticated advanced

607
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
persistent threat

608
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
something like the the uh the russian

609
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
activity and solar winds

610
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
when we discovered the weaponized

611
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,600
software update it took

612
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,799
us looking through 50 000 lines of code

613
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,280
without really knowing where the origin

614
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,559
of the threat was

615
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,120
we cannot expect the average company to

616
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
have that kind of rigor

617
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,880
for a mere software update and if you

618
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,760
think about it

619
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,000
best practices would have said to go

620
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
ahead and update the orion platform

621
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,120
with the new with the new software

622
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
update but that was weaponized

623
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,679
so you we put organizations in an

624
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,679
impossible position

625
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,000
in order to mitigate the risk of more

626
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,919
common commoditized threats we

627
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,320
absolutely have to have the baseline

628
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,840
of of proper practice of best practices

629
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,799
those things continue to be um you know

630
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,120
not in place i agree with my colleague

631
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,200
but no matter what there has never been

632
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
a firewall that blocked any of our red

633
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,600
team

634
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,919
activity there has never been a

635
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
technology that can keep out

636
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,480
a persistent threat that is nation state

637
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,440
sponsored

638
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
so i think we need to have a very

639
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
realistic view of our risk profile

640
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,279
when we're dealing with most of the

641
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,559
commodity threats

642
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
these basic practices are extremely

643
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,760
valuable

644
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,880
but when you're up against a

645
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
nation-state that is determined has a

646
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,240
mission

647
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,679
there is very little that a given normal

648
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,320
organization can do and they need the

649
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,159
help of their policy makers

650
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,080
and the the larger geopolitical

651
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,159
community to uh to bring the threat

652
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,880
actors

653
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,640
forward and to attribute their actions

654
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
thank you very much sandra and i really

655
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,720
like to pick this up

656
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,159
and you know go over to um

657
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,799
major general sector um from your

658
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
perspective i mean you heard your um

659
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,360
other panelists and talking about um you

660
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
know

661
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,039
dealing with the basics and how you know

662
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,880
the also the complexity

663
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
of um these new vulnerabilities

664
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,000
um and also about actually detecting um

665
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
you know the thoughts um of um

666
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
a malicious thyroid activity how is the

667
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,000
increasing inco

668
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,080
interconnectivity um of information

669
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
communication technology

670
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,960
um posing a specific security and

671
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
strategic challenge for the armed forces

672
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,279
and which you know role does also the

673
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,640
you know analytical

674
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
strategic differentiation of cyber

675
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,240
information space

676
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,840
play by capturing um these

677
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
and addressing those challenges from

678
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,120
your perspective

679
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,080
um and this especially with you know the

680
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,039
the armed forces i t

681
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,200
yeah thank you very much for these

682
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
questions

683
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
firsthand today we are challenged by

684
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,440
state actors

685
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,200
increasingly rely on hybrid strategies

686
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,679
especially below the so-called threshold

687
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
of a military conflict

688
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
and let's just for example look at the

689
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
way state actors systematically combine

690
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,400
attacks on technical networks with com

691
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,840
campaigns aimed at influencing public

692
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,000
opinion

693
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200
that's surely one of the

694
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
most challenging things for our

695
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,360
democracies

696
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,679
and especially for the western open

697
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,279
democracies

698
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,400
that's why we at the bundeswehr

699
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
cyber information information domain

700
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,320
hq adopt a holistic approach and we

701
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
heard already we need a holistic

702
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,600
approach across the domains

703
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,679
and including the information

704
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,720
environment and especially

705
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
have an perspective on the cyberspace

706
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
because if you want to

707
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,559
stay in a conflict below the

708
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,760
threshold of a military conflict

709
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,200
this is very often the first choice

710
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,559
and uh having said this

711
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,919
consequently we look at our its systems

712
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,279
we look at organizations and we look

713
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,480
also at the people when we talk about

714
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,679
how to foster our resilience and we are

715
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,080
only part of the society

716
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,679
you have an overall approach

717
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,520
in societies to be resilient

718
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,640
against the new challenges in the in the

719
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,159
two dimensions i

720
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,880
already mentioned we push for security

721
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
by design

722
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,080
but we also run awareness campaigns for

723
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
our personnel

724
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,919
we monitor our systems but we also

725
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,000
monitor what people in theaters say or

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,559
believe

727
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,399
that's this information part

728
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
and we share relevant information with

729
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,640
our partners cross

730
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,000
domain cross institutions

731
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
cross borders because

732
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,720
in the end today's conflict not

733
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,320
military conflicts these are collects

734
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440
of the whole society against these

735
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,880
kind of state actors on the other side

736
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,000
of the house

737
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,120
and how can you uh

738
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,960
best counter these challenges uh it was

739
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
already uh

740
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
said share information and share best

741
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,399
practice

742
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,760
and it's more than a technical it's also

743
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,430
a challenge for our people

744
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,440
[Music]

745
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
thank you very much i think yuan you

746
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,159
want to add something

747
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,880
yes i'd like to be a bit provocative

748
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,840
always

749
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,000
so i also would like to perhaps uh

750
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,559
building on what my co-panelist said and

751
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,919
put forward

752
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,720
and challenge a bit this uh status quo

753
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,120
of

754
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
thinking that collaboration coordination

755
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
is the only option i think

756
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,559
how to manage complexity is also

757
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,320
a a very complex set of

758
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,000
let's say ideas that we we might need to

759
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,720
explore

760
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,360
and one thing that i think we definitely

761
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,919
need to

762
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
explore is how do we incentivize the

763
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,080
vendors

764
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,640
and how do we incentivize the producers

765
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
to be better

766
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
and actually manage this complexity

767
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
themselves

768
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,320
it is unheard of in the context of the

769
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
internal markets where we have

770
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
different categories of products that we

771
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,880
put the owners always on the user

772
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,440
we never do that we always put the onus

773
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,679
on the producer we always put the owners

774
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,559
on the vendor why is cyber security so

775
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,520
different

776
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
and i like the fact that what bettina

777
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,520
brought out i mean we

778
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,039
basics are not introduced why

779
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,880
i think we need to answer this question

780
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,399
why are they not introduced

781
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,960
are we missing something when it comes

782
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
to the incentives

783
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,760
are we missing something when it comes

784
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,679
to the liabilities and i

785
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,760
again i would like to go back to the

786
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,159
proposal of the commission on the nis to

787
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,840
why does the commission introduce

788
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
managerial liability

789
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
for the essential service providers i

790
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,279
think it's an important step to great

791
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,159
incentives to

792
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,880
precisely introduce these very common

793
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,159
cyber security

794
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,720
risk management practices across the

795
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,840
industry

796
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
which are necessary in order to deal

797
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
with these basics

798
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480
otherwise we are continuously talking

799
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,880
about

800
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,159
sharing information building communities

801
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,080
and coordinating them but we are not

802
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,039
incentivizing these communities to

803
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,720
act in the in the right fashion

804
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,679
thank you very much well actually that's

805
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,720
perfectly um

806
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,120
said you said about missing liabilities

807
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,200
what about roles and standards which is

808
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,000
kind of a european topic of course but

809
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,320
um

810
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,240
also to the rest of the panels which

811
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,120
role can

812
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,200
standardization and certification

813
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,039
play in actually tackling the complexity

814
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,520
challenge

815
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
for me it's a key one actually i'm joe

816
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
and i couldn't agree more i think

817
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
you mentioned a couple of things earlier

818
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,159
which i really want to second i think

819
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,840
it's interesting for me that over the

820
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,240
past years while there was

821
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,159
times where you didn't even talk about

822
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,960
security or cyber or attacks or whatever

823
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,559
it was kind of a no

824
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,399
no word to use um if i look at the past

825
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,720
two three four years we all realized if

826
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,440
we don't

827
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,840
you know get together on this piece and

828
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,919
really have to trust as corporates also

829
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,279
as large corporates or with your

830
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,320
institutions

831
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
to really not just exchange best

832
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,600
practices but really

833
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,039
fostering standards into our supply

834
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,960
chains making sure that these standards

835
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,760
get

836
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,880
taken up by everybody then i think it

837
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,799
will be not good enough because only

838
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,640
sharing best practices as you said you

839
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,840
and i couldn't agree more

840
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,760
that will not do the trick but i think

841
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,000
it it puts a lot of pressure on all of

842
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,039
us that we really

843
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,760
open open ourselves up for really

844
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,600
working together on putting the right

845
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,159
emphasis

846
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,640
on the right standards which we need to

847
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,279
inject

848
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,600
globally because this is a global topic

849
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,039
it's certainly not a

850
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
country specific topic so that's why i

851
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,120
think we've just started this work with

852
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,399
many of our

853
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,000
large corporates for instance in our

854
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
charter of trust community

855
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,559
and it takes time and trust to actually

856
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,039
start

857
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,960
putting it and pushing it in exactly

858
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,880
this this manner forward but i think

859
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,960
it's the only way of making sure that

860
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,159
standards get

861
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,279
injected and you know as a and lived

862
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,159
upon

863
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,760
and i would also like to post this

864
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,279
question and give it to to

865
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,880
to major general um setzer is this also

866
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,000
um a conversation you have in the armed

867
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,640
forces

868
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,840
about you know standardization and

869
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,000
certification

870
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
and is it you know going in the same

871
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
direction or do you have specific

872
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,760
challenges

873
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,200
which um with the armed forces i t

874
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,240
um are posing in this

875
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,640
respective issue at hand

876
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,840
thank you for this challenging question

877
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,399
because

878
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,399
challenging is it for us as for others

879
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,080
that we have a broad

880
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,840
site of different i.t

881
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,559
so if you look into armed forces then

882
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,240
you start with it

883
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,080
in combat systems up to it

884
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,440
in office i.t

885
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,799
to hospitals you have the full range

886
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,760
and what is also challenging for all of

887
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,320
us

888
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,360
you haven't started to build up your i.t

889
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,440
yesterday we have started

890
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,080
years before yesterday and you have all

891
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,200
this it

892
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,519
in your whole system so having said this

893
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,120
for us obligation

894
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,640
to get standardization for the future

895
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,519
because only then you can in a system of

896
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,440
systems

897
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,880
overview what kind

898
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,559
of challenges concerning threats

899
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,918
could have impact on your id

900
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,800
and you can manage it therefore we

901
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
started

902
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,079
to develop in the german armed forces

903
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,520
and concerning you have

904
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,560
clusters for it services and you don't

905
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,079
allow that everybody takes the service

906
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,800
or

907
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,320
id may be hardware or software by itself

908
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,760
kind of toolbox everybody uses

909
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,359
this toolbox you have to say you have to

910
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,599
make standards for these toolboxes

911
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,719
an overall toolbox is the cluster for

912
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,599
cyber security and then you can build up

913
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,700
a kind of

914
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,320
[Music]

915
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,880
overview and inherent cyber security

916
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,800
uh in your overall spectrum

917
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,240
and therefore i say uh a kind of

918
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,280
standardization

919
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
is also a prerequisite for

920
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,680
security by design you need that to

921
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,400
build security by design

922
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,079
[Music]

923
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,720
thank you very much before we actually

924
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,680
move on to

925
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,920
the q a and we already received some

926
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,160
questions i would like to

927
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
pass on a last question to sandra um

928
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
from a threat intelligence perspective

929
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,520
um

930
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,359
well you know when we talk about threat

931
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,680
intelligence and how it should evolve

932
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
you know according to the cyber threat

933
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,800
landscape you know big data and ai

934
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,040
are kind of always talked about as a

935
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
game changer

936
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,119
sometimes but also as a challenge um so

937
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
what can these emerging technologies um

938
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,560
you know

939
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,359
bring us in terms of you know having a

940
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,599
more effective you know oversight about

941
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,960
what's going on

942
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,400
and maybe also how you know picking up

943
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,160
the norms and standardization

944
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,520
um you know discussion we just had um

945
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,560
maybe should we also kind of you know

946
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,640
before we bring them in also think about

947
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,560
norms and standards how to use it

948
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,400
and um how to make those solutions you

949
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,040
know

950
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,040
safe well i just want to caution

951
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
how we think about this uh in one way we

952
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,839
respond to over a thousand breaches a

953
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,640
year

954
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,119
and many many many of those are fully

955
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,480
compliant

956
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,520
uh companies and organizations that have

957
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,040
checked all the boxes

958
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,599
and so that again you know as some of my

959
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,040
colleagues said there isn't a silver

960
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,760
bullet

961
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,800
uh when we go into this uh and also

962
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,040
when we start talking about policies

963
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,079
where the

964
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,280
victim is concerned continually

965
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,160
expected to harbor the cost and harbor

966
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,760
the responsibility

967
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,920
um i think that we we have to balance

968
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,520
that out with understanding

969
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,079
the root causes and the root causes are

970
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,160
human beings on the other side

971
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,800
conducting these cyber criminal attacks

972
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
conducting these espionage attacks

973
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
and we can't lose sight of that now

974
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,920
looking forward to emerging technologies

975
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,240
you know i think we are all both excited

976
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,839
and terrified by some of the

977
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,240
technologies that we're seeing uh in an

978
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
organization where that i belong to it

979
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,240
at massachusetts institute of technology

980
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,880
they saw how they were training an ai uh

981
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
component to blend into the social media

982
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,000
atmosphere

983
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,440
and this persona became incredibly

984
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
racist

985
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,400
and really reflected the worst of

986
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,359
humanity

987
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,079
so as these things are are developed i

988
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,359
would say that we need to

989
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,760
to caution the developers and the

990
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,119
overseers of this

991
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,960
a threat intelligence analysts must

992
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
always be thinking about the inherent

993
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,839
biases

994
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,560
in their work and any tools and

995
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,079
artificial intelligence

996
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,119
should really uh be seen as a tool not

997
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,960
as a source of truth

998
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,800
and the explainability must be

999
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,240
transparent and

1000
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,359
consistently um evaluated for

1001
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,598
authenticity to to what is real

1002
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
thank you very much um so because we are

1003
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,040
like running out of time i'm

1004
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,680
posing the question from the audience um

1005
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,240
the first one is what is most

1006
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,560
pressing technology that we need to

1007
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,359
secure

1008
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,880
with priority um ege

1009
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,560
from a list mentioned are ai 5g

1010
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,880
6g and beyond e-government e-voting

1011
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,720
so which of these you know pressing

1012
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,880
technologies

1013
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,760
um do we need to secure most

1014
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,680
which are the priorities from your point

1015
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,078
of view

1016
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,119
i would also argue all of them i mean

1017
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,079
you can't really pick

1018
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,720
winners there uh and i think it's not

1019
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,480
only the high level and and

1020
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
the very forward-looking technologies

1021
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,119
sometimes we speak about very low-key

1022
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,160
little micro issues so it is

1023
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,200
uh it it is a very complex environment

1024
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,119
i would very much agree with sandra no

1025
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,119
standard no technology

1026
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,400
can can provide us with with absolute

1027
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
security security is always

1028
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,800
relative and i think in this complex

1029
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
environment that we're talking about we

1030
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,079
we can only seek

1031
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,320
at the levels of higher security that we

1032
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,880
know of there will be always risks

1033
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,000
um which will be out there which we you

1034
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,400
know

1035
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,320
it will be difficult to mitigate in

1036
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,520
advance

1037
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,119
but using the the the proper risk

1038
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,000
management

1039
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,280
methods and understanding the landscape

1040
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,200
better that helps us also to foresee

1041
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
these unknown risks

1042
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,960
and i think that's something that we

1043
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,200
mean we need to take in partnership

1044
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,520
so there i would very much agree that

1045
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
that we need to have this

1046
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
common understanding not only between

1047
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,280
us in the internal markets but also more

1048
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,319
globally and

1049
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,040
and and this is something that is worth

1050
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,839
striving towards

1051
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,720
does someone else want to add something

1052
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,800
to this question

1053
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,000
yes the challenge uh

1054
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,280
is that uh everything is connected with

1055
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
everything so uh from the perspective of

1056
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,480
an attack of an attacker he can choose

1057
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,280
the spot he wants to attack so if you

1058
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
have a system and make

1059
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,480
parts of the system very very

1060
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,640
sick safe then he don't go for the safe

1061
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,760
one he goes for

1062
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,040
the less safe one that's the challenge

1063
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
for the defender you have to defend

1064
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,160
everything

1065
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,400
because on the other side you can have

1066
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,280
the spot

1067
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,040
i have another perception

1068
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,240
you don't have take it only technical

1069
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,040
you have also to define what are the

1070
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,000
data

1071
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,359
which have to be especially safe and

1072
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,119
there you can make the difference

1073
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,040
because if you know

1074
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
what are your special data you have to

1075
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,760
have

1076
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,200
a special security and

1077
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
trustful id then you can

1078
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,480
focus on that one that's one of the

1079
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
things i guess

1080
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,960
everybody is doing but we have to do it

1081
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
perhaps much more effective

1082
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,800
yeah you can i couldn't agree more i had

1083
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
the same thinking on the data because if

1084
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,640
i look now at our

1085
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,480
um you know the situation we're all in

1086
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,640
covet and if i look at allianz we have

1087
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,520
more than 90

1088
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
percent of our people at home and while

1089
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,520
this is great that people can work from

1090
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
home you know the risk of making sure

1091
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,079
that you know the security is kept

1092
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,240
on the same level while you're working

1093
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,400
mobile from home or wherever you are

1094
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
that's certainly adding to this um to

1095
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,960
this complexity so i would

1096
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
second what uh johan said also in the

1097
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,079
beginning it actually

1098
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,160
everything needs to be protected but

1099
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,400
focusing on where data breaches

1100
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,880
and data will actually really lead to

1101
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,800
big liability issues for you as a

1102
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,520
company

1103
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,040
that's certainly a focus area um i would

1104
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,599
also recommend from a secure from a from

1105
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,119
an insurance perspective to take care

1106
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,599
that's actually perfectly because

1107
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,760
someone uh just posed a question from

1108
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,200
the insurance perspective

1109
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,560
um especially to you patina um and he's

1110
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
asking if people wouldn't

1111
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,280
lock their doors probably or barely do

1112
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,760
any

1113
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
maintenance for their cars would you

1114
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,599
offer them insurance

1115
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,640
how about cyber yeah it's actually it's

1116
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,480
a good question thanks for asking i mean

1117
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,800
that's

1118
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
that's i get that question fairly often

1119
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,640
like can you insure would we ensure

1120
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,280
everything

1121
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,520
and i can clearly tell you no if we do a

1122
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,400
risk

1123
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,599
assessment on a company you look clearly

1124
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,680
on how well they are established how

1125
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,520
much they take care of their i.t

1126
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,760
what's their i.t security patterns how

1127
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,839
they how they deal with protection and

1128
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,720
resilience

1129
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,800
so again it leads back to into a

1130
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,160
holistic risk

1131
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,800
adjustment where certainly ai and

1132
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
predictive modelling can help to judge

1133
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,200
pieces better but it will never go away

1134
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,000
that you need to have

1135
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,640
a holistic tools in place to look into

1136
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,200
this risk

1137
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,920
and then you give a perspective on what

1138
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,319
that

1139
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,720
tells you for insurance and how much

1140
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,920
that costs

1141
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,079
then um ultimately because you know you

1142
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,520
would um yeah

1143
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,119
not insure someone if the door is open

1144
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,800
i think this is one of the the major

1145
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
takeaways the holistic approach

1146
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,760
and we are running out of time it was a

1147
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,400
very very

1148
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,040
interesting discussion and i'm thanking
