1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,159
because i've been looking very much

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,280
forward

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,920
uh to address you and the munich uh

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,120
security conference

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,800
thank you very much uh for the

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,040
invitation

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,840
the reason why i'm so happy about this

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,679
is that something really important

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
is at stake during the pandemic

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,320
and we're not out of it yet

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,519
people businesses government we all

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,119
turned uh digital to find ways of

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,320
continuing

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
our lives to fulfill our obligation to

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
resume our responsibility

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
and with this increase in connectivity

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
uh obviously it means increases in the

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
challenges of protecting the security

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
and the confidentiality of what we do

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,680
we have seen and it is really

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,000
challenging to to recognize this we have

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,719
seen

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
increasing attacks on hospitals on our

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
systems

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,078
of our infrastructures

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
it's spiked also health authorities and

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
we have seen massive

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
misinformation overall the

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
internet is not a safer place now than

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,159
it was before the pandemic

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
maybe actually the other way around

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
fortunately a cyber crisis so far have

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,720
been avoided

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
but one can better in but imagine uh

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
what a situation that would be and

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
that is why more than ever we need to

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
put uh

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
cyber security at the forefront of our

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
priorities because all our plans

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
well they depend on the trust that you

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
can go online and you can feel safe

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,360
it's a duty that affects of all from

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,040
governments setting the right

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
policy framework businesses making the

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,560
necessary

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
investments to each event of us

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,079
to take care of our own online

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,040
activities

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
to know what we're dealing with and not

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,640
to be lured

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,159
into uh the first most obvious trap

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
and in every step of the way i think we

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:09,758
need to

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,400
uh think of cyber security as fully

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
integrated

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,560
with everything else we do online

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
and this is with this uh objective in

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
mind that

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
last december the commission the

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
european commission

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
adopted a cyber security strategy for

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,200
europe's

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
digital a decade sets out a long-term

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,920
vision

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,879
for building secure reliable networks

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,160
within the union

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
and put forward a number of concrete

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,239
initiatives

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
uh just to name a few uh through the

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,480
revision of the network and information

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,519
systems

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,720
uh directive we will make sure that the

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
legal framework

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
is up to speed with the risks of our

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,599
times

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
it will impose cybersecurity

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
requirements

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,319
um on important and essential entities

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
of our economy

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
facilitate the sharing of critical

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,040
information

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
such as incident reports or identified

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,720
vulnerabilities and strengthen

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
cooperation between national

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
uh and european authorities

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
built in on the example of the eu's 5g

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
security toolbox it sets out how we will

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
cooperate

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,799
uh going forward to ensure the security

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,519
of europe's

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,920
digital uh supply chain through a

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,080
risk-based assessment and a

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
thorough one the strategy

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
also launched the development of what

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
you could call the european

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,200
uh cyber shield

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,879
that is a metaphor for a network

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,480
of security operation centers enabled

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,799
by artificial intelligence that can

100
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,920
detect signs

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,280
of cyber attacks and enable preventive

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
action before the damages occur

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
other initiatives include developing

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
high standards

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
for the cyber security of connected

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,519
objects dedicated support for small and

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,480
medium-sized

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,440
businesses and attracting and retaining

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,839
the best cycle security talent

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,560
which is so badly needed within our

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
union

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
for all of this to happen we need the

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
necessary investments

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
and that's both public and private

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
through the digital europe program the

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,199
commission will

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
or has committed to invest 1.6 billion

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
into cyber security

119
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
and the wise deployment of cyber

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
security infrastructure

121
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
and tools towards uh the european union

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,919
in addition we're working with member

123
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,360
states to mobilize

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
cyber security funding through the

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,240
recovery and resilience facility

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
on this at least 20 percent uh in

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
general will be spent on digitization

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
that be skill

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,759
public services eid but a cyber security

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,680
one of the objectives last december

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
the european co-legislature they agreed

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
to set up a new cybersecurity competence

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,840
center and network

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
which will be located in bucharest

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
and the center will pull together

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
expertise

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
in cyber security research technology

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
industrial development from throughout

139
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,880
the union

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,280
to promote the deployment of state of

141
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,919
the art

142
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,960
cyber security solutions we are

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,479
currently working hard

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
uh with the remaining government to

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,720
ensure that it can get it up and running

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
as fast as possible but

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
for all of these investments to find a

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,039
home we will need a well-functioning

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
single market for cyber security

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,919
with an estimated value of 130 billion

151
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,120
euros

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,600
and growing more than 17 percent per

153
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,400
year

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
there are clear opportunities for

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,440
private investment

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
uh within the european union europe has

157
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
many assets here but that should not

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
satisfy us we should do better

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
last time we counted europe was the

160
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
location for the corporate headquarters

161
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,000
of

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,280
only 14 percent of the 500 global

163
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,080
uh cyber security providers compared to

164
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,039
75

165
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,080
for the americas 7 for israel and 4

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
for asia we are noted uh

167
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,440
for our cyber security know-how in

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,639
cryptography

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
and secure components and we have an

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
excellent scientific and skill base

171
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
uh in this area within the european

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,680
union

173
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
but we need to create a seamless single

174
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,720
market

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,800
for businesses to achieve the scale that

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,759
they need in order to grow

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,319
and one way of doing that is through a

178
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,479
solid european cybersecurity

179
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
certification framework will provide

180
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
european industry and digital service

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,319
providers

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,000
with tools that they can use to

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
demonstrate

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
to the global market that their products

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
their services

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
well they include state-of-the-art

187
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
cybersecurity features

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,120
using globally recognized european and

189
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,479
international standards

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,680
of and best practices well that will be

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,160
the

192
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,120
foundation of our certification scheme

193
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,840
to allow

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,400
our companies to remain competitive

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
with the help of our cybersecurity

196
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,759
agency

197
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
inita the commission will soon adopt a

198
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,759
work program

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,479
for certification for the coming years

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
what we do to make europe more secure is

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,759
only

202
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
one part of the picture because in

203
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,919
such a deeply interconnected world as

204
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,440
the one that we live in

205
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
well it is a paramount importance for us

206
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,400
that we act as one on the global stage

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
and that we work really closely with

208
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,919
like-minded

209
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,199
partners this is of the essence

210
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,599
last year the european union adopted its

211
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,720
first ever

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
sanctions against foreign persons and

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,080
entities

214
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,440
responsible for cyber attacks with this

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,520
we want to send a clear message that if

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
you attack us

217
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
you attack all of us and you will bear

218
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,080
the economic consequences

219
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
eu member states are improving

220
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
cooperation in intelligent sharing and

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,839
attribution as a mechanism to jointly

222
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,559
respond

223
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,760
to attacks and we are increasingly doing

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,000
this

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
with trusted partners around the world

226
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,640
as well we've seen with attacks

227
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,000
like solar winds that consequences can

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,880
easily spread across borders is

229
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,959
therefore all the more valuable

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,200
that we work together to prevent to

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
deter

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,399
and to respond to such attacks going

233
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
forward

234
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
we see the growing contrast between

235
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
different models

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
of internet governance it is crucial

237
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
that like-minded democracies

238
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
cooperate in promoting and ensuring

239
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,560
the open nature of the internet but for

240
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
that model

241
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,120
to thrive well citizens need to trust it

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
and to create that trust we need a

243
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
secure

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
digital environment thank you very much

245
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,080
for your attention

246
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,000
and now for the panel at long lost

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
her excellency margaret vs hargan thank

248
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,560
you so much for your statement

249
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,600
please allow me one short question what

250
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
is european union doing in order to line

251
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,440
up with

252
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
china and usa

253
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
well you'd see that cyber security

254
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
is uh is a is a feel of the red threat

255
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
of everything uh we do uh just

256
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
uh last week uh we launched the

257
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
leadership framework on artificial

258
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,880
intelligence

259
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,160
focusing in particular on sort of high

260
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,839
risk high risk use cases and one of the

261
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
i think really important things here is

262
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
that if it is a high risk use case

263
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
you may be discriminated in the use of

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
this technology

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,320
that cyber security making sure that

266
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,640
the technology can work in a trusted

267
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,360
environment

268
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
that is one of the key parameters and i

269
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
think that is the important that is a

270
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,560
way forward

271
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
that is in everything we do to integrate

272
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
uh cyber security

273
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
in the many member states who will

274
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,079
invest in digital skills

275
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,279
uh within the framework of the recovery

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
and resilience fund

277
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
also part of that skill is of course

278
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
that each and every one of us

279
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,760
is part of the cyber security defense

280
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
and i think it's really important that

281
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,160
we think of this

282
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
from the individual to the systemic

283
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
level and of course that we're willing

284
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,880
to invest

285
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,970
what is necessary

286
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:12,719
[Music]

287
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,440
so

288
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
you
