00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
the speed the global health constraints

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
around an issue as warring

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,279
as cyber security and dream in the cyber

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,480
world

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,840
the objective towards which

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,880
this meeting is oriented are

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
more than never and totally

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
relevant and of great topical

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,480
bottles sambar's ins and security today

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,760
is endeavored in our daily experiences

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
technologies the technologies are

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,960
redefined the boundaries the attributes

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
of power and generated new form of

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,280
uncertainty as

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
edgar moray moren says

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,799
we have to accept uncertain

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,280
uncertainties and life

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
with them our left

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,920
stills in the world and

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,119
our ways of action

24
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,560
and interact and interacting

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,799
in it on a local or global

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,119
scale are under the functional primary

27
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
of emerging technologies and

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,759
are subject to the multi-dimensional

29
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,880
dimensional and

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,320
involved involving the brain the digital

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
society

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
is a society of hazard is a society

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,360
of the risk you can say the risk society

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,719
to use the word of the german social

35
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,240
uh sociologist rick beck

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
certainly very well know

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
to you summer espace is a new space

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
of unfortunately of conflict a new space

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,680
for

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
stakes and multiple

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
challenges cyber insecurity has not

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
spared africa on the contrary

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
it increases the degree of

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
vulnerability of african countries

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
which are already fighting with

46
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,760
raw resilience in several respects

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
the danger is immanent in the daily

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
lives of our state and our society

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
with regard to the security and

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
protection

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,560
of personal uh data our countries

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
are faced with new forms of

53
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
aggression which are at the same time

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
economic sabotaged by spyware for

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
example

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
political external manipulation of

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
electoral constitution

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
in our continent international and idol

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
and ideological ordinary citizens

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
are not human to internet and

61
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,760
security just like officers

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,519
with the risk of short circuiting

63
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
and provision of public decision

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,040
and for policies at the regional level

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,239
uh witching is a framework of uh equals

66
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
you know e-comas is a

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
economic community of west african

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
region we have 15 countries

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,319
so more than 300 million people

70
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,440
and at the continental level we've used

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,319
the framework

72
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,760
of the african african union

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
efforts are being made in the

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,599
development of

75
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,640
cyber vigilance and cyber and cyber

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
security mechanisms

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
my country equals country

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
which signed the african union

79
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,640
convention

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,120
of cyber security and the protection of

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
personal data

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,639
adopted since 2000 2018

83
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
our law on cyber security

84
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
and the fight against cyber crime

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
which clearly defined the national

86
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,120
framework

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
of several security uh governors it's a

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
big challenge today

89
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,680
in a changing africa and uh

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,960
on the move is how to use

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,320
digital technologies to improve

92
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
practices and services when

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
protecting against server and security

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
how to find a balance

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
between the use of emergency

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,639
of emerging technologies and imperative

97
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,840
protection

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,600
and regulation in short the issue is

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,639
that

100
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,520
of the governance of global service

101
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
space

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
at national levels carl

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,800
popper one of your compatriots in europe

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
and the epistemologist

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
said that the strengthen this the

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
strength

107
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,919
of a scientific device lies

108
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,880
in this capacity to to withstand

109
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,520
falsifications

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
tests intended to prove is

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
falsified

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,560
at city

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
to paraphrase him i i i would say

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,840
that the strength of our digital

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
platforms

116
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
lies not so much

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
in the already established and no

118
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
performance as in their aptitude and

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
capacity to resist

120
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,280
brief and sovereignty so

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,360
we we miss the four corporate

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
more closely and jointly

123
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
bent mechanism for collective

124
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,680
cyber business and cyber security

125
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
collaboration between police and

126
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,759
security services

127
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,840
is essential with a view

128
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,280
to us when we say to us

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,639
in africa between us in africa or south

130
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,199
south

131
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
part in the world and the cooperation

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
between us you and i and i

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
in africa in terms of international

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
uh international cooperation

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,840
we need to do more collaborative

136
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,000
collaborative

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
work in cyber strategy and cyber

138
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
legislation thank you so much
