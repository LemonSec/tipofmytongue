8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
security to external organizations like

the world economic forum

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880

security cyber security board

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,840
kai hermsen we are very curious to gain

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
insight into the corporate perspective

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,399
go ahead with the fifth panel please

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
well thank you very much now we heard

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
throughout the day that data breaches

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
ransomware attacks

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
privacy failures and other cyber

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
security issues are

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
now on everybody's radar but still we

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,039
see

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
that companies seem to struggle with

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
preparing for them

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
they lack insight in the cyber risk

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
they might not have the right strategies

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,680
in place

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
and they don't practice their recovery

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,439
plans if they have

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,040
recovery plans at all so one could say

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
that most organizations approach to risk

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,960
management

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,799
is actually pretty risky now

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,920
the challenges that hold companies back

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
are manifold

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
and i'm very happy that in today's panel

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,400
we can discuss

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,520
this matter and the panel is labeled

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
corporate cyber risk management

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
what makes the difference so

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
without further ado i want to introduce

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,479
the panel

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,600
and i would go from east to west

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
if that's okay and we start all the way

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
in japan

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,560

a little bit westwards and

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,239
i think we go to great britain though um

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
uh martin clements is working

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
um for credit swiss located in zurich

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,080
uh but he's based out of great britain

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
if i'm not mistaken he's the security

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
adviser for credit suisse and in this

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
function he advises

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,040
both the ceo but also the the advisory

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,760
board

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
um on matters of cyber security and

95
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
innovation

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
by and large he has a long history in

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,519
cyber security 33 years

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,920
in national security in great britain

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
brings tremendous experience

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,440
uh on this meta and well i mean he's

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
he's i think he can tell from his

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
experience but of course also from the

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,080
current

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
uh work that he's doing on risk

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
management

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
and then let's jump the pond and move

107
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
all the way to the u.s where melody

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,080
balsa this

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
uh is located melody told me that it's

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
pretty windy over there today

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
so hopefully the line is stable

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
melody is the u.s head of cyber

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
technology data and resilience risk

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
for barclays i hope i got that one raw

115
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
uh that what that one right

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,478
uh melody um um

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,399
she she had been working for other

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
companies like aes

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,280
and ibm she holds a master

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
uh with marriage from the university of

121
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
manchester

and she's very active also or she has

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
been very active in for

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
in forums like isaka for example in the

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
past so

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
welcome all the to all the panelists i'm

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
very happy to have all of you and

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
let's dive right into this if if i may

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
first question um let's stay with malady

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,520
um

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,400
in the us so tell us a little bit about

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
the importance of risk management

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
to cyber security melody

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,600
sure thanks kai i'd be glad to take that

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,160
question

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
and it's such a simple question right on

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
the surface but

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
it's also one that has incredible depth

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,039
at the same time there's so many

140
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,919
different

141
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,720
ways you can describe and explain that

142
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,120
but

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
if i were to respond plainly right

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
without risk management

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,680
cyber security is just noise right it's

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,320
a

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
map without a compass if you will to

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
truly understand your cyber security

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
posture and run an effective cyber

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,479
security program

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,800
you really need to have defined and

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
measurable risk management

153
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
and so what i'd like to do is just kind

154
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
of break break down three different

155
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,280
areas that i think

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
need particular focus within cyber

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
security

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
and so the first is with identifying

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,600
risks it's

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
at the simplest most foundational

161
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
point of risk management but

162
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
understanding the breadth of your risk

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
cannot be done in a silo

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,320
right because risk identification can

165
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,080
come from many different sources

166
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
right beyond just your tools it could be

167
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
from end users even

168
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
and if you actually apply the the three

169
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
lines of defense model it could come

170
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
from any organization within

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
any three of those layers and so it's

172
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
otherwise relatively easy to identify

173
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,039
your vulnerabilities your

174
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,680
compliance compliance gaps configuration

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
compliance gaps and and the attacks

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
against your infrastructure so don't

177
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
work in a silo

178
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
and second is really prioritization and

179
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
where i see a lot

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
of cyber security organizations fail is

181
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
effective prioritization

182
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
and the ability to assess business

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,960
impact against likelihood

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
and so that's also i'd say at the

185
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
foundation of effective risk management

186
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,319
to cyber security

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,440
if you can i mean in other in other

188
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
words if you can't prioritize and and

189
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,360
create that view

190
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
you're not going to be able to apply the

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,199
right risk treatment whether that's risk

192
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,240
acceptance

193
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
whether it's transfer of risk or

194
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
mitigation of risk

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
so you can apply and even better if you

196
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,160
can apply this to your organization's

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,599
risk app

198
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,960
with the appropriate tolerance levels

199
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
you're now going to be armed to have a

200
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
conversation with leadership that makes

201
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,319
sense to the business

202
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,000
and i just want to land on the third

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,759
thing which is really about

204
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,080
enhancing your intelligence capabilities

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,919
and if you're fighting today's threats

206
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,120
then you've already lost the battle so

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
making sure that you're informed by

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
the threats that are on the horizon and

209
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
that are also specific to your

210
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,160
organization

211
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,639
is absolutely critical so the key point

212
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
really is solve for tomorrow

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
and this will help you greatly enhance

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,120
your ability to manage risk

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
thank you melody well yeah that's and i

216
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
thought like solve talk tomorrow and we

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,759
also learned that

218
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,319
risk management is very fundamental to

219
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,280
cyber security

220
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,440
now with that in mind mijoko if i may

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
turn to you

222
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
how institutionalized is that topic for

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,680
example in your environment in ntt

224
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
corporation also in in your area in the

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,199
critical infrastructure area

226
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,240
sure thank you so much so let me talk

227
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,639
about

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
how institutionalized cyber risk

229
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,919
management

230
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
is at ntt group which i'm working for

231
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
so the entity group has 280

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,479
thousand employees in over a week

233
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,199
operates

234
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,759
in over 190 countries around the world

235
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
so we cover not only telecommunications

236
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,319
uh i.t cyber security services but we

237
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,280
also cover

238
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,479
finance urban development advertisement

239
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,759
you name it

240
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
so it is really important to us

241
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
to have a common global language to talk

242
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
to each other because we have such a

243
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
broader cultural differentiations

244
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
among us so that's why we decided to

245
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,279
choose the nice cyber security framework

246
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,120
for the cyber risk management and

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
the entity group has cyber security

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,800
strategy

249
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
and a minimum baseline based upon his

250
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
cyber security framework

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,360
and we also have a global cso cng

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,640
oklahoma and he uh hosts uh

253
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,519
seasonal committees uh from uh different

254
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,000
uh

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
operation companies uh csos uh twice

256
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
a year and we discuss uh the

257
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,959
trend of cyber threats and we also

258
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,680
update

259
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
the cyber security efforts are made by

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
each operation companies every six

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
months

262
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,040
and our global cso also participate in

263
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
the weekly executive meetings

264
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
uh to update our c-suites

265
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
and he also regularly uh briefs to

266
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,320
our uh auditors so that narcissus

267
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
reasonable members and auditors

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
not all up to speed of the street

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,320
landscapes

270
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
and also the the cyber risk management

271
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
but to do that as melody mentioned

272
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
during her excellent presentation

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
measurement is important and to do

274
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
measurement we

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,360
also have to have a good visualization

276
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
to understand how to uh manage risks

277
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
so we use uh several um majors

278
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,959
to do several ways to do that and one

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,240
ways to do it

280
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
is another questionnaire based upon the

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
cyber security framework

282
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
we also use a heat map to see that the

283
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
changes of the cyber risk

284
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,519
to manage and we also use our

285
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,279
to to see the trend of for example

286
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,959
phishing emails we we see every week

287
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,480
so that our c suite can see the changes

288
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
or the trend of cyber threats

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
on how to prioritize uh the cyber risk

290
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,440
management

291
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,519
thank you thank you mihoko that was very

292
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
interesting to see how it's done in

293
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,160
entity group one thing you talked about

294
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
and also melody talked about with

295
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
um also giving transparency to

296
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,880
leadership to the executive level

297
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,600
and uh i think that we have some we have

298
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:07,920
an

299
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
uh panelist who can talk about this

300
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
because martin this is your job right

301
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
you're an advisor to

302
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
the ceo so maybe i don't want to talk

303
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
to you about how you advise the

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,959
leadership but

305
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
also the other way around what are also

306
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,880
the duties or responsibilities of

307
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,519
leadership

308
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
the ceo the chair what do they have to

309
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,800
do

310
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
if it comes to cyber risk management

311
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
from your perspective

312
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
well okay thanks very much indeed i mean

313
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
i think in some ways it's the flip side

314
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,839
of things that

315
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,839
uh miho and melody have already

316
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,959
mentioned um

317
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,640
and not everyone has got the memo by the

318
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,839
way i'll just pick up on something that

319
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,880
bruce said

320
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
earlier on uh in the previous session

321
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
that not everyone's listening out there

322
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
including some leaders and my goodness

323
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
at least in my opinion it screams out at

324
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,560
you

325
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
if an enterprise has or hasn't got an

326
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
engaged

327
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
top leadership when it comes to cyber i

328
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
mean look there's a lot they've got to

329
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
do but let me just make a few key points

330
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
perhaps you can come back to them later

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
i mean the first thing they do is that

332
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
they inform

333
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,279
themselves about cyber threats and they

334
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,800
they use that knowledge to lead a

335
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
discussion about cyber risk

336
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,959
appetite as uh i think it was uh

337
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
melodies already mentioned

338
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,079
and that discussion has really got to

339
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
happen i mean no defense against cyber

340
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
is perfect so the question the leader of

341
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
all people has got to answer

342
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
is how good is good enough

343
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
um you know if they're going to ask that

344
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,720
they've got to get educated about the

345
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
threat at all levels and

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,920
i often talk about the strategic the

347
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,839
operational the tactical level so the

348
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,240
strategic level the geopolitics behind

349
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,959
it

350
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,360
the operational level the systemic way

351
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
in which the risk is changing you know

352
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,839
why is there so much ransomware out

353
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,240
there

354
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
there at the moment and what you need to

355
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
think through to be ready for that well

356
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,360
what you need to think through

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
is your ransom policy so you don't have

358
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,399
to do it

359
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,760
in a hurry in a crisis um

360
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
look at a second headline i'll mention

361
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,279
is um

362
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,519
about leadership itself the leadership

363
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
of the organization their own personal

364
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,480
leadership which need to

365
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
evolve to be fit for the digital age

366
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
phrase i rather like i i really love

367
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
cyber instant exercises led by the ceo

368
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,040
because of course he's always throw out

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
valuable lessons but

370
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
also because they send a message this

371
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,200
matters to me

372
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,000
so it matters to you too look there's a

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
lot more here about

374
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,399
putting the right non-executive

375
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
oversight of cyber in place so

376
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
um i'm glad somebody mentioned

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,519
dashboards me who mentioned dashboards

378
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,000
already

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,760
hugely important deceptively so

380
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
and all of this there is not enough

381
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
it's a truism that cyber risk management

382
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
has got to be holistic

383
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
people talk about process technology and

384
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,440
people but i'd add things like behavior

385
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,199
culture and values that only the very

386
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:51,519
top

387
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
leaders can persistently pull all of

388
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,199
these threads together

389
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,199
and they must be pulled together

390
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
i would add that the

391
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
cyber ready ceo and chair

392
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
they seek additional assurance

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
personally for example

394
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
um you mentioned my role by appointing

395
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
their own experts to provide a second

396
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,519
opinion about

397
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,320
cyber defenses or by sponsoring

398
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,839
carefully targeted

399
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
red team testing or similar look just

400
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,600
one

401
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,360
final headline and it's about what i

402
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
call the digital advantage that the top

403
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
of the shop is

404
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
where the benefits of digitization

405
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,519
can best be judged against the price to

406
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,880
be paid for them i.e

407
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
including cyber cyber security i mean

408
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,800
typically

409
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,279
it's surprising we don't often make this

410
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,480
comparison

411
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
and perhaps it's best to think of cyber

412
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,959
as a tax

413
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,040
and attacks at a very reasonable low

414
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,240
level on the

415
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,839
overwhelming massive benefits of

416
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,959
digitization

417
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
the best 21st century leaders very much

418
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
have that trade-off in mind

419
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
um now look i'm going to take a risk

420
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
with my weak german here

421
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,839
uh ladies and gentlemen i think in

422
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
munich that we ought to say that

423
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,120
cyber really is chef sacher

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
yeah i i love it it was perfect uh

425
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,560
perfectly pronounced and yes chef zucker

426
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,920
is something that

427
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,480
we in germany like very much so that's

428
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
good

429
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,839
uh as long as cyber security is not

430
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,720
neuroland

431
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
for the ceos right so that's this notion

432
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,920
of

433
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
they don't know what this is all about

434
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
but i think you you made that point

435
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
that the best ceos in this day and age

436
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
they are cyber savvy

437
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
they understand that they need to think

438
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,839
about cyber and not just

439
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,839
digital transformation but also the text

440
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,440
you so you have this picture of a text

441
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
so i like that very much

442
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
and i also heard from you it needs to be

443
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
holistic right this holistic this broad

444
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,920
view

445
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
including more than technology

446
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,519
organization

447
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
and and so forth now when i think of

448
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
holistic i'm also thinking in this day

449
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
and age beyond

450
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,680
the company boundaries right towards the

451
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,839
ecosystem towards the supply chain

452
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,160
and in our previous panel with bruce and

453
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,040
thomas

454
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,199
they were they've been speaking about uh

455
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
the supply chain and i know that roman

456
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,880
you have this kind of thinking anyway so

457
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
roman i want to ask you so how's the

458
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
how's the ecosystem notion and the

459
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,320
supply chain

460
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,560
relevant to risk management

461
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,040
very good question thank you for that so

462
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,839
in my opinion as melody already pointed

463
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,560
out

464
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
is risk management is the top discipline

465
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,959
and secondary to that we have things

466
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,360
like

467
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
digital serenity because yes

468
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,800
i want to have the things i bought

469
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
making work the way i like and not

470
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,600
any other people can

471
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,800
interfere with my will in the cyber

472
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
space

473
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,520
the second is cyber security we are

474
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,720
reducing the risk

475
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,559
of running out of business by

476
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,160
raising our security invests

477
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,679
so now like three years ago

478
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,679
miss thunderline now our head of

479
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,039
european union was at that point

480
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,799
our minister for defense

481
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,000
she said that in her opinion

482
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,039
all the vehicles that

483
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,080
we have for defense in sea

484
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,360
in air and on land are nothing else

485
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,799
like million dollar iot devices

486
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,760
and they have a very very long supply

487
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,799
chain

488
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,240
and there is an entire ecosystem working

489
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
on putting those billion dollar

490
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640
devices together

491
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,160
so how can you make sure

492
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,919
that if cyber is key

493
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,120
for those billion dollar devices to work

494
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,960
properly that cyber is working properly

495
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,039
in those million dollar iot devices

496
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,760
and this question we raised in one of

497
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
our

498
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,480
very strong alliances

499
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
discussed for the last three years and

500
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,520
we

501
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,640
we came to the point the first

502
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,520
management

503
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
doctrine is you cannot manage

504
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,559
what you can't measure

505
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,320
then we figured out well if you want to

506
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,880
measure

507
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,480
something you have to know it so

508
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,760
it is impossible to reduce

509
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,480
risks if you don't know what is inside

510
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
the box

511
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,640
so now that leads to take a car

512
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,240
or a train and you want to understand

513
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,919
exactly which hardware and software

514
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,120
components

515
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
in the it are built in

516
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,760
that means you want to understand each

517
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
controller

518
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,520
on each of those devices built in

519
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,000
and you want to understand each of the

520
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
patch mechanisms

521
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
used to enhance

522
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,240
the opera capabilities of those

523
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,039
cpus inside so what does that mean

524
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,480
the entire supply chain must

525
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,320
deliver all the pieces that are in

526
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,880
and must explain how to patch

527
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
now let's like change to the

528
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
b2c market assume you have

529
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,120
a vacuum cleaning robot

530
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,799
what is there it always has power

531
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,080
so now you have a student building in

532
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,280
a camera a microphone

533
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
and a wireless interface

534
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,280
well that's very easy now you deliver it

535
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,760
because you say well the echo of the

536
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
whole thing

537
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,400
may explode use this one and it will be

538
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,360
used

539
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,159
so what you have is an alexa that is

540
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,000
steered by you

541
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
and now what we call that well it's

542
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
added values

543
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,559
in in the speech of

544
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,760
the back doors you are just adding

545
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,960
values to a product and if you

546
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,799
add the product values like in the car

547
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,559
you have a camera and you have

548
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,000
the voice control you may be able to

549
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,400
have

550
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,159
any cab in the world to be monitored

551
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,960
so the businessman sitting inside we've

552
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,919
heard about

553
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,720
some of the nations putting like

554
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
microphones into the business class

555
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
seats of their

556
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,520
yeah we have heard that but what does

557
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,559
that mean

558
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,480
if you want to opposite against it well

559
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,520
you have to take control and taking

560
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,080
control

561
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,159
means you know exactly what is built in

562
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,120
so that's the story what is the

563
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,200
challenge for the ecosystems

564
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
and for the supply chain we have to know

565
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
exactly what is in and how

566
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
to patch that this is not an easy story

567
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,360
but we have to challenge it

568
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,679
thank you ramon yeah i was just about to

569
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,039
say it seems like

570
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,000
it's not an easy story can i stay with

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,039
you ramon for

572
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,280
just another question if that's okay

573
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
because that really intrigued me to ask

574
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
okay now we know the challenge it seems

575
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
to be terribly complex

576
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,640
you would you i think this this picture

577
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,760
of a

578
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,559
billion dollar iot devices is it's a

579
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
little bit frightening i have to

580
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
admit though i'm in cyber security so i

581
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,320
see a lot of bad stories but this one

582
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,039
you know

583
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,679
that's uh that's even worse than the iot

584
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,159
fridge

585
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,880
right that is normally discussed so it

586
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
is about visibility

587
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
it's about asset management it's about

588
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
being on top of patch management

589
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,440
i i get that it is terribly complex

590
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
what's the state of play today so we

591
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
know the challenge but i want to ask you

592
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,679
harmon

593
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,760
where are we today right are we here

594
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,200
um we have

595
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,520
many in the think tank

596
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,640
thinking in the right way and some even

597
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
acting in the right way so

598
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,600
um like ishiga has told us trust is the

599
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
currency for diplo

600
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,960
diplomacy the first thing what we have

601
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,520
to do

602
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
is we have to be very clear in our

603
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,200
wording

604
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,960
and in the granularity so what do you

605
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,000
expect

606
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,840
to be trustworthiness when you buy

607
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
a bluetooth chip there

608
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
are no added values inside so the

609
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,039
bluetooth chip doesn't

610
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,799
uh have any back doors and can talk to

611
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,919
anybody

612
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
which you don't know this is a feature

613
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:32,960
you

614
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,360
expect from a trustworthy bluetooth chip

615
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,080
so how do you get the trust in the

616
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,720
delivery chain

617
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
how can you be sure well you can say

618
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,159
well if i have a liability of let's say

619
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,159
500 million dollar

620
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
for a piece that costs me one dollar

621
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
that's sufficient for me and

622
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,919
probably you will check whether the

623
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,120
500 million dollar liability

624
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
will be in effect because because if

625
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
that's the startup

626
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
and there are two guys hanging around

627
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
and just have like

628
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,919
10 000 of the bank account it will not

629
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,799
be

630
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,320
helpful to have this liability so

631
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,679
what i'm trying to say

632
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,440
is you have a fine granularity

633
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,480
on the trust that you put in things

634
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,080
and yes you can document that and yes

635
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,159
if you have this entire

636
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,279
supply chain you can also build

637
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,559
a trust chain so you can have the

638
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,559
attributes that you're interested in

639
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,080
modulated in a trust chain

640
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,199
so what does that help

641
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,840
assume you are very very

642
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,120
interested in availability you will

643
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,919
figure out

644
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,039
that any invest in availability is

645
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,279
opposite to this in confidentiality

646
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,679
this is something that not everybody has

647
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,960
from the first take

648
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,320
so take two firewalls

649
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,440
you have two eyes piece

650
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,760
you get the firewall from the one vendor

651
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
on the one side and

652
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,279
from the other on the other side what

653
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,840
you have you done you have

654
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,159
increased availability

655
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,799
because if one of the firewalls gets

656
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,000
down

657
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,200
the other works still so now

658
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,720
what i'm trying to tell is that not

659
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,799
for each device confidentiality is

660
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,000
the most important thing so now

661
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
the chain of trust goes along with

662
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,320
availability for example and you

663
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,520
can kick out all the rest so it's you

664
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
really have to deep dive a little bit

665
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,919
into and it's kind of device specific

666
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,919
and also the parts in the supply chain

667
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,600
need to be managed

668
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
let's say individually and looked at

669
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,600
individually if i if i understand

670
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
correctly right

671
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
then management yes yes thanks

672
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
uh thanks roman that was you know that

673
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,000
was very interesting to see and also

674
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,279
this notion of trust

675
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,600
all of a sudden i i need to say coming

676
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
into risk management

677
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,080
now i'm a firm believer that that trust

678
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,279
is very important

679
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,120
and of course i'm i'm with the

680
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,559
ambassador there that

681
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,720
that trust is very important trust is a

682
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,600
currency

683
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,799
i say trust is gold

684
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,080
and this is also um something that is

685
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
in the ecosystem and you need to think

686
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
about the ecosystem now

687
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
thinking about this relationship to of a

688
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,799
company

689
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,320
let's say to the surrounding companies

690
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,360
to the economy that they're active in um

691
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,279
that also brings me to the notion of

692
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
of benchmarking and checking how a

693
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,720
company

694
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
performs in relation to other companies

695
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,760
or what is also out there in terms of

696
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,320
threats

697
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,600
and and and challenges mihoko if if i

698
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,279
can turn to you again

699
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,600
how is the notion of benchmarking and

700
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,559
and you know

701
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,520
external knowledge threat intelligence

702
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
important to risk management how

703
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,720
how do you do that at entity group

704
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,640
sure so i i i must mention the child of

705
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,440
a trust

706
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,000
because each other trust us the name

707
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,039
mentions

708
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
and symbolizes now when it's all about

709
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
trust right because that

710
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,880
it's it started out as the european

711
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,159
companies forecast um consortiums to

712
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,360
talk about

713
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,640
cyber threats and educations and uh

714
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,799
uh supply chain risk management and as

715
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,399
an mentioned

716
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,440
but it's now more globalized than the

717
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,159
entity

718
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,080
is the second member from the

719
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
indo-pacific

720
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,960
and we as we globalize and

721
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,799
we have better picture and visualize the

722
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,760
cyber risks

723
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
and also supply chain management so

724
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
that's great

725
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,360
but we also have to have a sector

726
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
specific

727
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
um landscape on

728
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
cyber stress the supply chain risk

729
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,880
management

730
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,399
so that's why each country

731
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,520
or each region has isaacs or information

732
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
sharing and analysis centers

733
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,480
and luckily enough japan has multiple

734
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
isaacs like uh telecommunications ict

735
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,960
finance and so does the united states

736
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,320
and we also have a close sector forum

737
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,279
in japan consisting of uh different

738
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,720
critical infrastructure

739
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,600
sectors so that we can talk about not

740
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,080
only

741
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,720
cyber threats but we can also talk about

742
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,919
an education

743
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,840
and cultivation of uh cyber

744
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,960
professionals because

745
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,440
ramon said you know the cyber risk

746
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
management is all about

747
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
uh technology process on people

748
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,840
so i i think that these different layers

749
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,880
of um uh platforms

750
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,520
to talk about different issues uh by

751
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,240
sector

752
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
by country and by region or by

753
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,559
the grove and i think we are in a good

754
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,360
shape

755
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,480
to understand the cyber risk management

756
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,200
thank you and and thanks for well of

757
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
course referencing the chart of trust

758
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
which is close to my heart so thanks for

759
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
that and also for

760
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
giving us an overview on how this is

761
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,679
done in japan uh

762
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,000
which is of course very interesting um

763
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,039
to the audience

764
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,960
now there's two roots that i want to

765
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,200
pursue in in what you just said

766
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,080
one was working with you know external

767
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,640
bodies

768
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,799
authorities and the other one is more

769
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
about the people dimension the human

770
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,640
dimension that the education

771
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,039
i want to park that for a second uh

772
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,120
first want to go to the authorities and

773
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,679
and i think martin i want to give that

774
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,720
question to you

775
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,760
how do you best kind of incorporate or

776
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,159
work together on cyber issues

777
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,559
with authorities national authorities

778
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,919
law enforcement

779
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
and or also peers please give us an

780
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,919
insight maybe from your

781
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,640
vast experience well look i mean i'll

782
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
tell you how not to do it

783
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,000
and how not to do it suddenly and in the

784
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
middle of an instant

785
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,200
so um i i guess the key message is

786
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,559
get in touch while uh there's nothing

787
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,200
going on

788
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
learn who out there um

789
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,399
i can help you and if you're running a

790
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,000
global enterprise there may be lots of

791
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,760
different jurisdictions so figure out

792
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,600
who's really smart and good on

793
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
different subject areas i mean look you

794
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,880
know you might want to work out how to

795
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
build relationships with people frankly

796
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
invite people in get to give you talks

797
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,799
um within the limits of what is

798
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,919
allowable to you of course

799
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,799
do your best to be helpful in return so

800
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,880
i would say all of that is of vital

801
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,559
importance and can i just add one other

802
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,919
advert in this space

803
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,240
don't do it alone do it in good company

804
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,559
build alliances with your peers

805
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,840
think about the people who you're

806
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,519
normally in commercial competition with

807
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,640
go phone them up

808
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,399
as a top leader one of the my advice is

809
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,399
give license to the caesars to talk to

810
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
each other intimately and especially

811
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
in the middle of instance so let's be

812
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,240
adjusting my sort of brief thoughts on

813
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,679
that

814
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,600
excellent thank you very much so this

815
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
this notion of collaboration and also

816
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
setting this up before the crisis hits

817
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,519
right so establish these relationships

818
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,880
in let's say good times uh so that they

819
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
are also there and helpful in hopefully

820
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,880
uh times that yeah i mean you're doing

821
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,159
your top level

822
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,240
cyber instant exercise you better think

823
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
about okay so who would we have found at

824
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,799
that point

825
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,320
uh are they still in the job when did we

826
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,000
last see them um

827
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,039
have things moved on in this

828
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,399
jurisdiction since the last time we

829
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,440
wrote this down

830
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,720
you take the point yeah that's excellent

831
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
thank you very much

832
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,240
um now i i already said i wanted to

833
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,840
think a little bit about the education

834
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,279
and the human factor and uh

835
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,960
as it happens there's a question from

836
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,360
the audience uh which i would like to

837
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,000
give to

838
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,159
malady if if i may because i know melody

839
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,159
you have been active on isakka and

840
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,480
and the like so so these institutions

841
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,799
that are very helpful in educating on

842
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,000
on on cyber security the question goes

843
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,480
like this

844
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,559
a major source of cyber risk is the

845
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,159
human factor

846
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
how can the human factor better be

847
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,840
integrated

848
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,240
in risk strategies melody

849
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
sure kaia thank you you know it's an

850
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,720
interesting question that comes up a lot

851
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,960
right because at the end of the day um

852
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
your your company your organization is

853
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,240
only as

854
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,440
strong as as your people and you it's

855
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,320
the expertise of your cyber security uh

856
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,519
team it's not

857
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,840
the the wizards in the i.t department

858
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,200
but the people that use

859
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
the technology and that must follow and

860
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,080
hear the policies that you set out and

861
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,480
so

862
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
there are different things you have to

863
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,919
consider i mean one

864
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,320
i think most of us uh understand that

865
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,080
the more you can automate the better

866
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,320
right take the risk out of the hands of

867
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,200
the user

868
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,519
it's always going to be a goal you want

869
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,799
to strive for

870
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,799
right and do that as much as you can

871
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,799
because when you can automate

872
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,679
when you can collect and monitor you are

873
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,399
able to get

874
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,600
insights that will help you better

875
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
protect the organization and understand

876
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,880
what some of those risks are right um

877
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
but at the end of the day

878
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
there are certain certain risks that

879
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,919
you're not going to be able to

880
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,760
to automate or to be able to control

881
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,919
through techno technical means

882
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,000
and for that reason it's extremely

883
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
critical that you have an effective not

884
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,159
just

885
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,399
a training and education program but a

886
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
communication strategy

887
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,519
right this is open dialogue with uh the

888
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
end users with your community

889
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,039
with stakeholders across the

890
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,200
organization and this message needs to

891
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,679
come

892
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,039
from different leaders across the

893
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,000
company as well uh you mentioned

894
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,679
isaka for our example right it's an

895
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,279
organization that i've been

896
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,919
very close to for for many many years um

897
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,159
it's an industry organization

898
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,120
that helps advise uh people that work

899
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,679
within

900
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,239
it and cyber security risk management

901
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,280
and audit

902
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,918
and it's really been a good place to for

903
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,599
communities to come together

904
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,280
to help solve some of those problems

905
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,879
have some of those conversations and

906
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,879
martin was saying with your peers

907
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
right when you go to conferences like

908
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,280
this one of the biggest values from that

909
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,599
it's not it's one of course the content

910
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
that the the conferences deliver

911
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,918
but more so it's those meetings and

912
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,440
conversations you have with the person

913
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,000
sitting next

914
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
to you next to you right how are the

915
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,280
other people

916
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,800
that that are around you solving

917
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
probably the same problems that you're

918
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,320
faced with in your organization

919
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,399
you know have those conversations and

920
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
and get ideas

921
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,639
right and like back to back to isakka

922
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,359
they're um

923
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,359
they have a plethora of materials and

924
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,760
resources that you can use and reuse

925
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,159
and share um it's just a great community

926
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,119
of people to

927
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,880
to get connected with if you want to

928
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,839
understand some of these challenges

929
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,560
better

930
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,040
thank you mihoko i saw you you wanted to

931
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
also say something to this

932
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,078
uh so pl please go ahead

933
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,320
sure so i know the some factor

934
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,760
we haven't talked about uh today is i

935
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,599
think the stress level

936
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,920
because the reason why we are using this

937
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,800
platform

938
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,280
combining our face-to-face meanings in a

939
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,040
nice hotel in munich

940
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,920
with like music and also the wigner

941
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,400
another online to to eat or talk to

942
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,480
each other is because it is thanks to

943
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,240
this pandemic right

944
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,280
and but we human beings and

945
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,200
we have been able to utilize the i.t

946
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,480
technologies to talk to each other and

947
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,079
stay connected

948
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,280
but it also creates a huge amount of

949
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,240
workload especially for i.t and cyber

950
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
security

951
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,560
workforce and the microsoft published a

952
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,320
really interesting report

953
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,480
last month on on the stress level

954
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,599
among our cyber security professionals

955
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,720
and microsoft knowledge and

956
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,599
we see the more work to do on more

957
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,960
online meetings to

958
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,079
to take care of so they are so

959
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,359
feel so fatigued and stressed

960
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,720
and we really as merely uh emphasize the

961
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
importance of the face-to-face

962
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,040
meetings and contact and physical

963
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,839
conduct

964
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,119
to each other so i think it's

965
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,520
worthwhile to mention during this munich

966
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,680
cyber security conference now how to

967
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,280
to to um

968
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,200
to uh take down the level of stress

969
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
among cyber security professionals

970
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,720
because they are the unsung

971
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,240
heroes to to protect ourselves from uh

972
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,359
cyber threats

973
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,839
and this is especially important for

974
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,920
cyber risk management and for this

975
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,000
uh winner on cyber risk management

976
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
thank you yeah a very important point

977
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,000
right

978
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,119
with the cyber threats rising and

979
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,520
and of course the workload to cyber

980
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
security professionals rising um

981
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
and actually no end inside right uh so

982
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,599
the pandemic

983
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,800
uh leading to more and more remote work

984
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,119
in all our world going online of course

985
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,640
it's more and more and more important to

986
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,720
do cyber security right so taking good

987
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
care of our people of our cybersecurity

988
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,079
people

989
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,520
is important thank you for mentioning

990
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,000
that uh mijoko and really an important

991
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
matter

992
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,280
one thing that could relieve the

993
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
situation a little bit or at least there

994
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,240
are high hopes and

995
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
and melody mentioned it earlier with

996
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
automation there is a question from the

997
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,200
audience that is

998
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,560
is more specific also on ai

999
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,760
and deep learning and the question is on

1000
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,599
um ai and deep learning in the sense of

1001
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,440
can they contribute to a better risk

1002
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,560
management and

1003
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,040
relieve risk and security professionals

1004
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,000
and and i

1005
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760

yeah thanks very much kyle i don't know

1012
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,440
what this does remind me of is a

1013
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,240
question

1014
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,359
um used to get asked often when i was in

1015
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,560
government which was um it's one of

1016
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,760
those sort of fun

1017
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,440
party questions for cyber professionals

1018
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,760
if you like is is the offense or is the

1019
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,680
defense going to end up on top and the

1020
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,960
answer of course is

1021
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,599
um neither it's going to go on forever

1022
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,720
this is going to be

1023
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,640
an arms race and for every new

1024
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
technology that comes along to help us

1025
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,000
like machine learning along comes some

1026
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,359
other new feature which is going to

1027
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,960
cause this difficulty in this case

1028
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
perhaps adversarial

1029
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
machine learning or the ability of deep

1030
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,040
neural networks to develop new

1031
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,400
tools to trouble our defenses

1032
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,920
so the the the answer to the specific

1033
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,440
question is that yes of course um

1034
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,599
machine learning can help us in many

1035
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,480
ways

1036
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
but that it's going to need to because

1037
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,359
the threat is going to continue to

1038
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,160
accelerate

1039
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,079
now my guess is that ramona's got more

1040
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,680
to add to that so i'll stop there

1041
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,119
come on please please go ahead well

1042
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,599
if if i'm allowed to there are two

1043
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,720
questions

1044
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,480
uh that i was shortly uh reading

1045
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,599
one is about how can eu get

1046
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,119
digital sovereignty and the other is

1047
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,520
how can governments and companies work

1048
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,839
together to secure stability and

1049
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,440
reliability um

1050
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,240
if you wouldn't mind i would love to

1051
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,599
take that attention

1052
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,839
go ahead pick one of them if that's okay

1053
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,599
and then we leave the other one to

1054
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,680
somebody else on the panel so i know

1055
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,520
digital sovereignty is close to your

1056
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,000
heart so

1057
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,359
come on if you want to take that one

1058
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,440
that would be great yeah

1059
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,520
so we have to see that the method

1060
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,760
how cyber security is purchased

1061
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,200
is not best of the breed but

1062
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,560
cheapest cost so what we do

1063
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,000
is we reduce quality

1064
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,119
to reduce the price

1065
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,040
that doesn't help communities ecosystems

1066
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,839
to be built

1067
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,440
up to be full scale

1068
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,560
so we see that like every

1069
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,920
computer has antivirus on it

1070
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,280
what we see is antivirus is

1071
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,599
a cheap and pressing market

1072
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,520
so the vendors for

1073
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,800
antivirus will not cooperate

1074
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,839
that's the result if we press the price

1075
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,440
down

1076
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
we don't have any expertise anymore we

1077
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,520
have like three five

1078
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,640
global players so now

1079
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,400
when we look wintergearst has asked for

1080
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
cooperation

1081
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,599
cedric oh has asked for tools to protect

1082
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,240
and reggae schmidt said we need

1083
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,800
confidence and trust

1084
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,599
and in my opinion this does work

1085
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,480
together

1086
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,680
only if we accept

1087
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,599
that having a high knowledge needs to be

1088
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,240
fed by money it doesn't help

1089
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,880
because those who have real high

1090
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,240
knowledge

1091
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,440
they will be driven out of the market by

1092
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,319
those

1093
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,319
who sell fake security and we have a lot

1094
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,960
of fake

1095
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,359
security so we have to really

1096
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,280
challenge that problem on a political

1097
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,560
on an alliance on a consumer

1098
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,920
and on a manufacturer's side and we

1099
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,640
can't get them together at the moment

1100
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,079
because one euro is spent

1101
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,160
only one time it may be spent for a new

1102
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,079
sap version it may also be spent for any

1103
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,760
computer science

1104
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,040
investigation but

1105
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,319
still the fight for this one euro

1106
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,160
is dominant is key against producing

1107
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
collective

1108
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,640
quality cooperation that gives us

1109
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,680
full scale security

1110
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,079
from all of the vendors all of the

1111
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,599
manufacturers

1112
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,240
so i hope this this statement is saying

1113
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,119
what i'm really

1114
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,160
trying to do for the last 30 years

1115
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,040
bringing together communities with

1116
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,560
knowledge

1117
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,319
and i see money is always opposite

1118
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,520
thank you uh ramon for this um this

1119
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,960
observation

1120
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,760
of uh collaboration of bringing together

1121
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,560
knowledge

1122
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,880
now maybe since we only have three

1123
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,839
minutes left

1124
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,800
i want to do a very last round also of

1125
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,079
the other three panelists

1126
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,920
and taking this notion of collaboration

1127
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,800
because we all said it's important

1128
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,760
now i want to ask you how can we

1129
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,000
increase that level of collaboration and

1130
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,720
please give me just one or two sentences

1131
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,359
and i want to start with mihoko one two

1132
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,640
sentences how do we increase

1133
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,000
collaboration on cyber security

1134
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,520
to accelerate the collaboration i think

1135
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,240
we need

1136
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,800
to trusted leaders so that everybody

1137
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,359
wants to

1138
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,640
okay because he or she says this we have

1139
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,560
to do this because then he

1140
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,319
or she knows now what to prioritize

1141
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,240
then we can accelerate the collaboration

1142
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,440
i think

1143
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,000
excellent thank you melody right over to

1144
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,160
you uh one two sentences how do we

1145
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
better collaborate

1146
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,920
yes and i think martin touched on it

1147
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,599
earlier but it's breaking down the

1148
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,359
barriers to collaboration

1149
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,400
much like organ like the organizations

1150
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,599
like the charter trust

1151
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,359
it's enabling legally um the ability to

1152
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,599
have conversations with your competitors

1153
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,920
right that your business competitors and

1154
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,359
talk about these discussions

1155
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,160
as a cyber security cohort so breaking

1156
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,280
down the barriers to

1157
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,319
to collaboration excellent so we heard

1158
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,079
kind of top-down leadership breaking

1159
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,000
down the barriers martin

1160
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,920
anything to add to this on on

1161
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,400
collaboration anything else you can give

1162
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,760
us i'll quickly quote two u.s presidents

1163
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,800
uh

1164
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,839
first of all barack obama um which is uh

1165
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,480
don't let a good crisis go to waste so

1166
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,240
every time we have a major incident

1167
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,839
i wish i had a dollar for every time i

1168
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,160
bet solarwinds has been mentioned today

1169
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,800
but um don't let a good crisis go to

1170
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,200
waste

1171
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,960
use these incidents before something

1172
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,119
truly terrible happens

1173
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,880
um and then finally bill clinton um um

1174
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,319
you know and i love the question earlier

1175
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,720
on about about people you know hey look

1176
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,200
you know

1177
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,599
in the sense of cooperation in the sense

1178
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,200
of the malicious insider or

1179
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,079
just the incompetent insider uh you know

1180
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:12,319
i

1181
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,560
i heard a great phrase once which was uh

1182
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,599
it was cyber

1183
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,839
well it's the people stupid

1184
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,319
thank you very much and how nice to end

1185
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,280
with quoting

1186
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,400
uh to us president so thanks thanks a

1187
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,680
lot for this panel

1188
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,319
i want to do a really quick summary or

1189
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,640
wrap up of what we talked about

1190
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,119
before we then of course give back to

1191
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,160
the moderator

1192
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,079
and uh continue with the with the

1193
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,839
conference so really short we learned

1194
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:40,160
that

1195
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,440
risk management is really fundamental to

1196
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
cyber security because

1197
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,960
it is it is about really prioritizing

1198
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,000
and measuring

1199
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,480
the risks and then prior to prioritizing

1200
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,400
the strategies and the measures

1201
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,520
that you take to deal with that risk

1202
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,359
now that exercise is of course done by

1203
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,599
the cyber security team and the cso and

1204
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,720
the needs to involve the top level

1205
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,960
leadership and they also have a duty

1206
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,560
uh to take care of it so it's chef

1207
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
zachary as we heard from martin

1208
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,119
now what they have to do is to really

1209
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,480
have that holistic view

1210
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,880
incorporating the supply chain looking

1211
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,800
also to the outside world and also doing

1212
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,359
this benchmarking outside and

1213
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,359
one thing that they need to do is take

1214
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,640
good care of their people

1215
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
educate people and really take in the

1216
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,760
human factor

1217
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,040
and by doing so um well they can have a

1218
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,359
good

1219
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,560
uh risk management and setup but there's

1220
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,920
also a lot to be done

1221
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,200
so collaborate more that's at least

1222
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,880
one statement that we want to give back

1223
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,319
