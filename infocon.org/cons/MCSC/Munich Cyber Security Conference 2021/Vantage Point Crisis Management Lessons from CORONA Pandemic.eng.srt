1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,879
moving on to the topic our minds are

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,480
deeply troubled with

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,600
covet 19 yet today from a

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,880
digital perspective i am very curious to

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
learn what message bernado marino

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,239
director digital health and innovation

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,480
and the chief information officer at

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,960
world

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,240
health organization who in geneva has

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,199
for us

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,480
he is responsible for setting who's

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,840
strategy of health

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,199
in the digital age mr mariano please

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,000
share your views with us lessons to

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,480
learn

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,078
during the corona pandemic

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,440
thank you thank you for having me here

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
and

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,920
the the pandemic is teaching us all a

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,879
lesson

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,640
and many fronts uh but on on the digital

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
front

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,399
one of their lessons that at the world

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,000
health organization

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that we we had to brace

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
and survive this this pandemic in

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,400
addition to

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
the the epidemiological side was the

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
the

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
fodemics as i call it we call it

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,680
actually we created a science

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
called infidence and we brought a number

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
of scientists to discuss

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
the ephodemics but within the infodemics

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
there is the whole cybersecurity element

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,880
we all know and i think we all read in

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
many

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
media both social media and mainstream

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,759
media

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
the how how much health

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,079
care organizations suffered from cyber

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
security attacks

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,960
and we were not the exception the world

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
health organization

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
saw a dramatic increase on

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,200
attacks to the organization itself or

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
digital assets

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
but also to the individuals in the

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,640
organizations

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
especially the the the the the

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,560
leadership

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,719
uh and then people that with influence

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,680
in the organization so

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
there was a lot of that and we have seen

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,878
as well

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,319
in whole health care sector hospitals

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,120
suffered cyber cyber attacks as they

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,760
fight

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
they were fighting the pandemic which

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
was not something that anyone

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
expected when before the pandemic

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
nobody expected that while we are

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
fighting a global panemic

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,440
we had to fight um cyber attacks

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,319
in such an increasing way but in

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,760
addition to

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
this increase of cyber attacks

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,560
what we saw as well was the the

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,280
the this blurred line between

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
work environment a protected environment

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
at the workplace

72
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
and the extension of that workplace with

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
the teleworking

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,480
which then required us to actually look

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,599
at the

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,560
office not just from the perspective of

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
bricks and mortar like the building

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,360
where people come and

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
sit down in their offices but the office

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
became

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
where people were sitting at their homes

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
and cyber security and security

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
perspective

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,920
had to be extended to the to the

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,200
to the to to the teleworking environment

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,680
of

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,480
of of staff colleagues that are that are

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,879
that are

89
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,519
working in those environments according

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,400
to the health

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
care information my management system

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,680
society they

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
they did a survey the healthcare

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,159
organization experienced

95
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,519
this increase of incidence phishing

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,879
attacks by 55

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,000
57 and in social engineering attacks by

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,280
by by a number they think of

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
multiple faults and fishing remains the

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,799
top incident security

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
and at double joe we had to extend that

102
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
protection to ensure that that

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
even the private accounts email accounts

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
social media accounts of a number of who

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
staff

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
were protected to ensure that that the

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
the the penetration to who didn't take

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,519
place

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,280
through those through those through

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
those social medias and

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,759
private private accounts

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
head through shutdowns shut down um

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
old systems uh legacy systems that were

114
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,919
vulnerable to attacks

115
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,440
we had actually suffered impact

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
on performance of some of the the work

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
and then the collaborations that we have

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
with a number of universities

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
during the pandemic because some of

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
their legacy systems

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,919
had to really be shut down because they

122
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,600
were compromised

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
for because of the cyber attacks

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,520
luckily before the pandemic we had

125
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,800
we had already a cyber security

126
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,280
roadmap which we had planned to

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
implement in four years

128
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
we had to implement that the cyber

129
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
security roadmap we had to shrink i mean

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,240
to

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
accelerate the implementation and and

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,840
basically

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
the plan of four years had to be

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,479
implemented within one and a half year

135
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,400
or just to show that that that

136
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
while before we had over

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,880
three three incidents a month we started

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,759
having

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
three incidents a day of cyber security

140
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,960
so so that that increase required us to

141
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
actually change the plan accelerated the

142
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,080
plan and

143
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
make sure that the systems remain

144
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
uh protected but

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
work we couldn't do that alone and

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
that's the message that i bring

147
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,160
here because the cyber security attacks

148
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
or the cyber attacks

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
do not happen because one individual is

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
sitting down somewhere

151
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
doing it alone they work in a very

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
coordinated

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
fashion they have groups they learn from

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
each other

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
they look at the vulnerabilities pass on

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,400
to

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
others and exploit those vulnerabilities

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
so we had to also ensure that we

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
work well coordinated with other

160
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
entities and i have to

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
say a huge thank to at least six member

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,800
states six countries

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,319
that helped us from the cyber security

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,520
perspective giving us

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,400
early warning alerts we had the three

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
major companies private companies that

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,199
helped us

168
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,160
giving us early warning alerts working

169
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
we had the

170
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,319
pro bono engagements to give us tools to

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,360
ensure that

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
we were ready to respond to protect

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
the the digital assets of the world

174
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
health organization

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,240
to say that all this is to say that

176
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
for us to address the cyber security

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
in a comprehensive way for us to

178
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,319
to ensure that we remain ahead of the

179
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,280
of the of the of this of this cyber

180
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
cyber war

181
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
we need to work better and well

182
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
coordinated

183
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
but better than the cyber than the

184
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
hackers we need to

185
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
share experience knowledge ensure that

186
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,479
what is what the private sector knows

187
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,199
about

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,160
how it operates how countries cyber

189
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
security entities

190
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
are able to to to provide intelligence

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,039
is

192
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,440
all to make sure i mean it has to be

193
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
brought to the to

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
together to ensure that as a community

195
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,000
we

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,039
protect what is important to us today

197
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,800
which is data data is perhaps the new

198
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,280
gold

199
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,240
in the new digital age is a it's it's

200
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,960
it's

201
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
if we think about the gold rush today if

202
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
you think of data

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
where it's highly monetized this is this

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
this is this is where we need to make

205
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
sure that efforts to protect

206
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
it's it pays off in terms of

207
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
using it looking at data as an asset so

208
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,639
the pandemic

209
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
showed that increased um of of

210
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
attacks it exposed the vulnerabilities

211
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
and it reminded us that personal

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
security cyber security and and

213
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,720
professional cyber security it's it's

214
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
it's it's very intertwined so

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,640
four areas that we need to to work

216
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
together

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
one is the governance the other one is

218
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,279
prevention

219
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
the third one is detection and the

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
fourth one which is all equally

221
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
important is

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
response and recovery so whoa

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
we went through all these areas in terms

224
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
of strengthening governance

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
strengthening prevention making sure

226
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
that we're able to then identify

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
and detect attacks as they happen the

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,680
most important is

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
if it happens we're able to respond and

230
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,720
recover

231
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,760
very quickly so that that that was

232
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,480
the that's in the team to to support

233
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
that has to be

234
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
had to be increased substantially and

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
then and the story is i'm telling you

236
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,480
about

237
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
how we had to basically increase the

238
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,720
response

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
accelerate the the implementation of

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,920
cyber security

241
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
i think it's the same story that you

242
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
will find in many

243
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,800
health care entities be hospital be

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
ministers of health

245
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,959
and others that are involved in

246
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,760
addressing

247
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
and fighting this pandemic where the

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,839
kovit 19 became

249
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
suddenly a target from from from from

250
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,600
many

251
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
from many hackers either to looking for

252
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,040
data

253
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
looking for vaccines or data

254
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
any type of data that they could could

255
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
they could sell or monetize or just

256
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
compromise security

257
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,080
so in who

258
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,440
is from this pandemic in the lessons

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
that we learn

260
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
is that partnering with computer

261
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
emergency response team of countries is

262
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,760
key

263
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,560
and we continue to do that partnering

264
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,839
with the private sector

265
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
is key we continue to do that

266
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,200
ensuring that we create we have a

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,959
detection mechanism

268
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
a teams that

269
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
constantly look at what what are the

270
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,600
vulnerabilities inside the double choice

271
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,320
key so

272
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
the ethical hackers we have i mean the

273
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
other group i want to

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
to be very thankful for the ethical

275
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,839
hackers some of them

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,800
helped us to to alert us of areas of

277
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
exposure

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
that the organization had and and

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,440
allowed us to take preventive measures

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
of course investment in in in

281
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
in technology tools systems training

282
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
it was key because as my cyber security

283
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
the chief information security officer

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
says it says that

285
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
the most vulnerable element in the whole

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,720
cyber security ecosystem are people

287
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
because we people either use the weak

288
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
passwords or share or keep

289
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,120
click on links and of course the hackers

290
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,839
try to

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
leverage on this vulnerability of people

292
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
that clicks on different

293
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
links to to to actually to be able to

294
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
access systems

295
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,279
to prevent that intense training and

296
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,399
retraining

297
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
is mandatory at the world health

298
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
assembly so so

299
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
so within this governance mechanism and

300
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,440
then

301
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,880
the prevention elements the

302
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,720
in addition to tools processes

303
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
that people training is those those are

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,640
some of the areas that we

305
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
we we invested substantially to ensure

306
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,040
that

307
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,000
the experience we learn the experience

308
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,040
we had

309
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
the lessons we learned and the

310
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
investment we made

311
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,880
puts us into the next level of of of

312
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
security protection

313
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
of double joe with where the data

314
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,399
of a lot of member states sits in terms

315
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:10,720
of

316
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,279
data that they share with us to to to to

317
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,240
provide

318
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
to the whole world the situation of the

319
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
pandemic in this case

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
but also where the data and the private

321
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,399
data of

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,279
this the staff members is hosted by the

323
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,079
organization

324
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,880
and as well as the data of the entities

325
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,680
we interact

326
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,920
with the non-state actors such as

327
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,800
universities

328
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,880
is sitting so we we have the

329
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
responsibility to protect

330
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,399
and to do that we had to

331
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,240
increase that investment making sure

332
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
that we build that collaboration

333
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
but the key word here is how can we

334
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600
as a entity

335
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
be it private public uh

336
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
or or or academia or even civil society

337
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,000
how can we ensure that we build

338
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,320
systems and the to to to protect

339
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,240
the asset that the the which is the data

340
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
which is into the digital world this is

341
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
the gold

342
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,839
in the in the physical world so how can

343
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,720
we protect

344
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,839
the the data assets to to ensure that

345
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,480
that we we we do not so we have that

346
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,760
repeated again

347
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
now some measures that i want to just

348
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
give you just to

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
to dive into a bit more detail is that

350
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,959
we

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,800
we prior pandemic we didn't have a

352
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
secured operating center

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
for instance so we had to build that

354
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,920
during the pandemic and accelerate that

355
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,320
we

356
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,519
we had we we had to include ensure that

357
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,199
we have a red team and and we

358
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,240
have a threat intelligence solutions to

359
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
alert us way up front

360
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,639
on on on on potential threats

361
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,160
and and and and also other risks that

362
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,880
that we we ran we we were exposed to

363
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,519
so this combination of people

364
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
trained people skills and

365
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
processes which includes governance

366
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,880
and and ways to alert each other but

367
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
also technology

368
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
where we the the combination of these

369
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,920
three areas people process and

370
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
technology

371
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
is what allowed us to to move

372
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
from the securities cybersecurity stand

373
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,399
we had

374
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
prior to pandemic which was i would say

375
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,399
very low

376
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,560
to an acceptable level are we at the

377
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
level where we want to be no we're not

378
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,000
we still have

379
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
work to do and we still need a lot more

380
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
collaboration support from

381
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
from a number of entities that that are

382
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,079
out there

383
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,800
and we have to take the lessons of today

384
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,199
to

385
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,600
do better tomorrow and that's where that

386
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
collaboration

387
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,680
that collaboration that in partnership

388
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,480
is key

389
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,120
so we are open to that partnership to

390
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
ensure that

391
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,839
this digital transformation of health

392
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,440
happens in a way that lives and not

393
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,800
uh the lives are protected so

394
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
we want to bring that collaboration to

395
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,079
