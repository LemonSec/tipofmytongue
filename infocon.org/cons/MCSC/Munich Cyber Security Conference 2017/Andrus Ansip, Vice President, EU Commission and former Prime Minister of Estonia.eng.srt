2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,280
excellencies ladies and gentlemen it is

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,219
a pleasure to be here in Munich video

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,279
today I would like also to thank all the

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,460
organizers this will be a great event

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,320
once again so I don't think Estonia is

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,779
perfect enough to teach other countries

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,199
using our own examples so I don't want

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,160
to do that well there's so many security

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,280
experts in one room you do not need me

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,620
to tell you about the global threats

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,070
posed by cyber crime I think it is

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,100
enough to say that today people and

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,750
companies no longer think about if they

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,410
are going to be fact but when it will

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,520
happen or maybe worse if they are not

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,580
sure if they may already have been fact

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,470
how they prepared to deal with it are we

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,590
will businesses survive is Europe as a

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,680
whole prepared at the moment I would say

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,759
unfortunately not we're working hard to

22
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,000
do something about it cyber threats

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,420
evolve as quickly as technology which

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,000
plays an increasing part in our daily

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,259
lives all these devices systems and

26
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,840
services are connected exposed and

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,930
vulnerable an effect might come from

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,509
have remarkable for political goals or

29
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,780
one with financial motives it might be a

30
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,040
threatmate with ransomware fiber threats

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,960
or even nation-state cyber espionage or

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,140
it might have no obvious objective other

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,799
than to disrupt for the sake of it

34
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,530
the definitions are not as clear as

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,579
before cyber weapons are also becoming a

36
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:20,989
commodity the concept of a predictable

37
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,670
threat as we used to know it is long

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,349
gone today both the targets and the

39
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,950
attack methods are far more

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,379
unpredictable my god first-hand

41
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,519
experience of cyber attacks when I was

42
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,579
the stoneham prime minister over three

43
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,989
weeks in 2007 a wave of distributed

44
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,129
denial-of-service attacks turtle dozens

45
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,349
of governments and commercial services

46
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:01,760
he has been called wept war one and the

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,230
stoner was clearly chosen taught not

48
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,200
surprisingly a stern has now fixed

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,129
cybersecurity has a top political

50
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,769
priority political parties and elections

51
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,419
now also attract fiber criminals this

52
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:23,810
risk into our democratic processes is

53
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,379
real and one that we take very seriously

54
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:33,889
critical infrastructure like transport

55
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:40,760
energy banking health care is at risk no

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,410
sector is immune from attack we can no

57
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,340
longer assume that our IT systems emails

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,199
phones personal computers are safe but

59
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,470
these fighting cybercrime a one-sided

60
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,989
battles a struggle that criminals are

61
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,709
winning I do not believe that it is but

62
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,769
only provided that we do not become

63
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,379
complacent and only if we take these

64
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,798
threats seriously and if we tackle them

65
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,760
together even the speed of technological

66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,130
progress countermeasures must be

67
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,159
constantly updated to keep up with new

68
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,830
challenges and risks as they emerge how

69
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,500
regulation is one possible instruments

70
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,969
and there is a place for it when

71
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:44,330
appropriate we can help ourselves with

72
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,510
obvious precautions like using strong

73
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,849
passwords two factor authentication and

74
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:54,190
preventing fishing by dealing

75
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,700
systematically the strange emails but

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,029
the main thing is to work more closely

77
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:07,389
together so that we reduce the risk that

78
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,820
means a solid commitment to research and

79
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,380
investment in cybersecurity it means we

80
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,400
have to coordinate closely share

81
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,010
experiences and know-how and help each

82
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,750
other and it means everyone carmen's law

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,639
enforcement industry NGOs research

84
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,020
institutions by sector nationally as

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,159
well as internationally you probably

86
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:44,240
recall the events of last November when

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,580
a vast international criminal

88
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,650
infrastructure known as ever launched

89
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,729
was taken down the operation involved in

90
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,279
prosecutors and investigators from 30

91
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,880
countries with coordination provided by

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Europol and euro just five individuals

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,880
were arrested 37 premises searched and

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,880
39 servers feast victims of malware were

95
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,789
identified in more than 180 countries

96
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,690
which shows just hope for avalanches

97
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,220
activities that spreads

98
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,310
this international operation shows why

99
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,870
we need to cooperate across borders with

100
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,810
the fiber threats we all in the same

101
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,830
boat so we are all at risk ultimately it

102
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,130
is individual new countries that had to

103
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,160
deal with attacks upon Network situated

104
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,240
on their territory some comments will

105
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,470
also say that it is only they who

106
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,650
contract to protect national security

107
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,180
and nobody else but no single country

108
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,300
can realistically fight these attacks on

109
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,720
its own in addition capabilities for

110
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,540
dealing with the cybercrime are uneven

111
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,830
around EU countries that makes us all

112
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,410
vulnerable to cross border and cross

113
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,950
sector cyber threats mixed national

114
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,860
approaches and poor cross-border

115
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,410
cooperation weaken the effectiveness of

116
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,260
countermeasures international

117
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,340
cooperation will help to fight an attack

118
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,860
certainly at the early stages not only

119
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,470
to remove a specific threat but also

120
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,300
contains Franklin the world has been

121
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,440
slow to do all this in Europe we have

122
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,960
not been coordinated enough to cope with

123
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,419
the problem and that problem is that we

124
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,990
are fighting and almost invisible and

125
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,330
unconventional enemy lurking in the

126
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,950
shadows it is time for you to catch up

127
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,669
on cyber ratios I'm pleased to say this

128
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,650
is now happening for the digital single

129
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,010
market had to work properly our digital

130
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,669
networks have to be protected cyber

131
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,750
security is top political priority for

132
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,900
this commission as part of our

133
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,539
commitment to make year of receipt the

134
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,219
cyberspace we can play

135
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,139
an important coordinating role in

136
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,759
shaping regulation but only where it is

137
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,529
needed last year we set up the first

138
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,829
eu-wide cybersecurity law the network

139
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,560
and the information security directive

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,180
and we launched a public-private cyber

141
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,540
security partnership generates 1.8

142
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,810
billion years of investment by 2020 the

143
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,500
idea is not only to fight cybercrime

144
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,209
effectively but also to make sure that

145
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,970
EU components can compete in this path

146
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,360
growing markets with huge potential for

147
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,199
jobs and growth working closely with the

148
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:35,540
Europe cyber security industry is vital

149
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,899
each of these steps forms part of a bush

150
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,730
throughout 2017 to strengthen the user

151
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,939
oil capacity cooperation and resilience

152
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:51,420
in dealing with the cyber attacks later

153
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,600
this year we will review the EU

154
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,110
cybersecurity strategy based on three

155
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,980
elements directly tackling cybercrime

156
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,009
quarantines network security and working

157
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,019
closely with our partners around the

158
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,910
world because the Internet of Things

159
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,529
where we know there are security

160
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,819
concerns not only in here a cyber

161
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:23,970
physical systems interconnect they will

162
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,389
become smarter more powerful and more

163
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,529
capable they will bring opportunities

164
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,860
social and economic but they will also

165
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,889
become more vulnerable to botnet attacks

166
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:42,270
that may affect thousands of devices

167
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,670
the Commission has been working on how

168
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,870
to improve the security of the IOT in a

169
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,550
system by 2020 we may be looking at

170
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,460
around 50 billion connected devices

171
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,350
worldwide since there are no rules yet

172
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,020
for their security we are looking at

173
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,010
several options these includes codes of

174
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,720
conduct for privacy and security and

175
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,100
certification schemes for network

176
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,560
devices to provide a minimum level of

177
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,120
secure authentication eu-wide

178
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,290
certification would help to strengthen

179
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,170
trust and confidence in the online

180
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,750
environment and also make sure that

181
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,120
cyber security products and services are

182
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,070
technically compatible between countries

183
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,800
we already aware of national initiatives

184
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,890
to set strict cyber security

185
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,440
requirements for ICT components in

186
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,040
traditional infrastructure including

187
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,850
certification requirements these are

188
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,190
important but we should part against

189
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,010
interoperability apps developing or

190
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,200
different national requirements

191
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,700
splintering in the EU single market

192
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,850
ladies and gentlemen while the network

193
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,820
and information security a directive is

194
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,460
great progress I believe that Europe

195
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,580
needs a more systemic approach to

196
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,030
cybersecurity there is growing awareness

197
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,320
that EU coordinated efforts regulation

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,790
as much as cooperation can make a real

199
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,240
difference to the resilience of European

200
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,230
network and information systems as we

201
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,700
have heard lately cybersecurity is no

202
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,950
longer enough we need a strategy of

203
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,380
defense prevention and response but what

204
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,340
do we really mean by resilience

205
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,770
resilience is an a variation of what

206
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,910
happens before during and after a

207
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,940
digital network system comes up against

208
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,270
the threat resilience accumulates over

209
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,850
the long term and most importantly it

210
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,100
should be included in overall business

211
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,700
and organizational plans that is what we

212
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,920
European industry policy makers and

213
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,950
leaders and have to make sure happens on

214
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,540
the ground to create an environment

215
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,150
where the public and private sectors

216
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,730
work together to minimize the risk of

217
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,200
cyber attacks to think long term to

218
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,500
prepare to capacity builds as a way to

219
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,470
ward of attack and to make Europe's

220
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,100
digital services and networks as safe

221
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,900
and secure as they can possibly be thank

222
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,110
you

223
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,529
thank you very much Commissioner you

224
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,899
have agreed to take a few questions so

225
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,490
it's now up to you to pass whatever you

226
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,360
want is no the opportunity for you just

227
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,269
raise your hand otherwise I have a

228
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,899
question you mentioned that you were

229
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,639
enough Tony or the victim of the first

230
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,529
web walk 60 70 years ago we created the

231
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,350
NATO as an answer to a traditional war

232
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,720
do you need do we need now right now a

233
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,110
similar organization in Europe or in the

234
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,209
Western world to fight together the

235
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,370
threat cyber threat I'm happy to say

236
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,389
that a cybersecurity excellent center of

237
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:58,750
mater is located in tellanon Isola but

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:05,589
as I said cooperation is really

239
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,959
important if we would like to deal with

240
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,540
those of you know cyber threats in a

241
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:21,250
solas case just thanks to two really

242
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,290
fruitful informal cooperation between

243
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,610
different tips computer images or a

244
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,360
response teams majority of those attacks

245
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,290
they were cut even they crossed our

246
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:40,300
borders so I believe no single country

247
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,500
it doesn't matter be one or small one is

248
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,889
able to deal with the cyber security

249
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,550
issues alone we have to cooperate and we

250
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,209
had to share information I don't think

251
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,100
we have to share information with

252
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,000
tabloid media but but those who have to

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,660
note like search for example they have

254
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,870
to get information what kind of offer of

255
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,259
new weapon those bad guys are really

256
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,360
using thank you ok that's one question

257
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,740
in second row again

258
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,080
very good thank you the focus of this

259
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,560
conference is industrial control systems

260
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,730
cyber security in any business that has

261
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,940
an industrial control system we worry

262
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,380
about security and we worry about

263
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,830
consequences on the business side we

264
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,959
might worry about stealing trade secrets

265
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,959
we might worry about stealing customer

266
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,899
information on the physical side we

267
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,560
might worry about power plants being

268
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,149
compromised and the lights going out

269
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,990
water systems being compromised in

270
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,690
businesses that are involved with

271
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,430
physical processes can you talk about

272
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,589
consequences what kinds of consequences

273
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,050
should these businesses be more or less

274
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:11,609
concerned about most this will be a

275
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,730
really long speech I I would like to add

276
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,020
also our citizens most people they are

277
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,689
worried about their privacy so their

278
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,240
prayers are rarely protected that our

279
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,170
businesses are they are not only worried

280
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,510
about their business secrets but but it

281
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,780
sir hmm quite easy to do all the

282
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,000
cyberattacks against somebody some

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,050
institution some political party season

284
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,210
it's it's possible to take over the

285
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,320
control of hope about hospitals for

286
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,530
example to use encryption to lock all

287
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,960
the data to get some money and then then

288
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,750
to be encrypted this data once again and

289
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:06,300
then and so on so I I think the solution

290
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,179
for all those texts is almost the same

291
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,710
at first we have to cooperate we have to

292
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,309
share information but we have to teach

293
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,510
also our people not only non this

294
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,510
industrial level but but it's also our

295
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,090
ordinary people to all from people they

296
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,110
think that

297
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,960
that somebody somewhere there I don't

298
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,520
know who Microsoft German government the

299
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,600
European Commission somebody else said

300
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,470
they will protect them but our people

301
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,470
they can also play really important role

302
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:56,549
for example if buying some some some new

303
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,330
devices the air conditioner worker or

304
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,720
mobile phone I think it will be

305
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,160
reasonable to change this by default

306
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,950
settings pink coats and then and I'm so

307
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,460
want well you know so we all know how

308
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,520
they are great with botnets you know

309
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,860
it's so easy to take over control of

310
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,590
those devices or things which are still

311
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,200
those by default security settings so we

312
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,460
have to educate our people as what it

313
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,679
was mentioned in the very beginning of

314
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,559
this session thank you okay thank you

315
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,570
much

316
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:49,119
[Applause]
