00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,760
[Music]

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,269
mr. vice president do i distinguish the

3
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:16,270
audience what's that fair I mean my

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,040
first appearance in public in my new

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,730
position making me so nervous mr.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,460
Schaeffer legit Jedi's for a kind of

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,570
revenge of her yeah before I come to

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,439
that topic with really short

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,570
introductory speech I'll want to come

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,149
back to something was especially were

11
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,429
shared in his keynote the role of

12
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,010
education especially for that topic and

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,010
I think you perfectly pointed that out

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,309
how important education and that

15
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:54,429
coherent ears and I think we we all

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,659
should remember that educational efforts

17
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,940
of today form the basics of economic

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,560
values of tomorrow and I think said

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,720
something which very very often gets

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,380
lost in our discussions especially here

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,619
in Germany where we have a specific

22
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,939
situation where we very often no too

23
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,000
often discuss about is it the federal

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,090
effort education or is it a state F word

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,820
or what is it now and especially when we

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,780
come to that topic preparing are used

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,409
for the a digital generation I think

28
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,630
here in Germany we have some holes to

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,939
fill let it be very careful but we are

30
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,030
talking about 50 risk a lot of setting

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,409
has been said already and I think the

32
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,750
subject is as important as it could be

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,380
in front of a munich security conference

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,530
because when we talk about security i

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,990
personally do not want really to divide

36
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,330
between security and an analog

37
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,069
environment and security secur

38
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,930
issues in the digital environment I

39
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,200
think both came together and too many of

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,230
us is still probably not too many of us

41
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,420
in that room but too many of us in the

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,290
civil society still have a kind of a

43
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,099
pittoresque picture of a digital aggress

44
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,739
or the so-called hacker young guy sorry

45
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:43,150
ladies mainly guys in that picture

46
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,689
between 16 and 22 years old drinking

47
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,269
coke or the more modern ones drinking

48
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,349
redbull to stay awake smoking Goldwasser

49
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,000
and and they are attacking our systems

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,930
yes maybe I would not exclude that part

51
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,370
of aggressor but I'd say the chances

52
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,269
that they succeed probably relatively

53
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,780
seldom the problem is the two real

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,049
aggressive whoever they are private

55
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,819
organizations or organizational formats

56
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,970
close to government they have quite a

57
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,909
lot of these people not just one sitting

58
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,370
in his cellar room they have quite a lot

59
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,769
of these bright people keen people who

60
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,659
know how to deal with the subject and we

61
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,269
all have to learn that investing in a

62
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,120
set of preventive controls may by no

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,819
means be sufficient to prevent any

64
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,650
aggressor coming into our systems it

65
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,169
needs a combination of preventive

66
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,199
controls of course together with

67
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,159
detective controls and of course it also

68
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,049
needs mechanisms and being prepared

69
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,359
having strategies to what are we doing

70
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,139
and how are we reacting when it happened

71
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,649
and your estonia by example is a very

72
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,048
good example for that and even if you

73
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,400
were able to defend the maturity of the

74
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,920
aggressive

75
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,850
if issues at the border in some cases it

76
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,140
may be sufficient if just one for few

77
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,710
threats manage it to enter your systems

78
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,740
and just imagine that not only in the

79
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,980
world which is our day-to-day work like

80
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,390
now if somebody wants to hack my surface

81
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,880
device here mmm there will be a bit of

82
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,410
problem it will stop my talking but not

83
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,390
more but what about a world of internet

84
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,480
of things what about a world of digital

85
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,420
health what about in the world of autumn

86
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,100
fully automated traffic what about if

87
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,780
somebody enters our water supply systems

88
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,700
our critical infrastructure and I think

89
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,980
what we have to develop is a kind of a

90
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,430
common understanding about the threats

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,550
they are out in the world and also a

92
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,040
common understanding as you mr. vice

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,120
president said in most of the cases we

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,090
will just succeed in defending these

95
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,850
threats when we closely work together

96
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,520
whether they say in a kind of an

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,890
organization or whether there's in

98
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,870
cooperation of the individual computer

99
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,110
emergency response teams wherever they

100
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,640
might be located and there is an issue I

101
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,730
want to close with because it comes back

102
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,640
to what I said at the beginning in terms

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,230
of Education we have to educate computer

104
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,660
and IT security we didn't do that too

105
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,810
much we didn't do that extensively in

106
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,580
our universities in the last year's not

107
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,920
in informatics and especially not in all

108
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,890
the other disciplines and

109
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,979
if you do that in a really good way we

110
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,430
can probably manage something which goes

111
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,460
very easy over the tongue but it's very

112
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,339
hard to achieve the buzz word is

113
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,520
security by design having some

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,460
experience in software development for

115
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,360
almost 30 years I know that for quite a

116
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,199
long time let's be open to that we

117
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,389
didn't care about and it's not so easy

118
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:13,379
to switch over to get really a

119
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,209
software-based the software architecture

120
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,779
where security by design is implemented

121
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,149
in software structure itself

122
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:26,289
nevertheless we all know that would be a

123
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,289
very important issue and I for my part

124
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,149
thank you for your attention and I'm

125
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,309
glad to be part of the panel discussion

126
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,410
afterwards thanks very much

127
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,189
