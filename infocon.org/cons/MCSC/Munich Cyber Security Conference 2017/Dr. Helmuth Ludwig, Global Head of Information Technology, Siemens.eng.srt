2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:09,870
excellencies ladies and gentlemen good

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,389
friend of mine and the US government the

4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,560
former US government he he said lock

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,510
they're simply two types of company

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,210
there are companies that are as we have

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,490
heard before that I hacked their other

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,199
companies that just simply don't know

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,730
that they are hacked and there's no

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,250
other group of companies and what I

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,660
would like to do today is I would like

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,759
to put it in the context of the

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,910
megatrends we all observe and part of

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,040
the answer to those mega trends is and

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,570
one of the megatrends is actually

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,800
digitalization and 2020 we will see more

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,680
than 50 billion connected devices just

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,840
some years ago it was 1 billion so we

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,969
see an enormous exponential increase

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,570
here and the I strongly believe the

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,520
Internet of Things we have if you have

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,870
seen something we have seen the tip of

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,460
the iceberg so far the answer is there

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,409
opportunities to use software to use

25
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,439
analytics in our production processes in

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,200
our grid systems and only to those we

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,540
will be able to address the requirements

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,110
for increased flexibility time to market

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,380
reduction by fifty percent so it's a

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,420
wonderful world all its digital and it's

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,710
all perfect and we address the

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,750
challenges of mega trends if it would be

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,360
secure and and this is one of the

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,189
critical topics and you mentioned it

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,229
before what are we talking about here in

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,820
this conference we talked about

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,759
industrial control systems and the

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,150
organizations in the US ics-cert so the

39
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,340
cyber emergency response team there

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,770
reported that actually the attacks on

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,619
these control systems have increased by

42
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,229
almost twenty percent by seventy percent

43
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,630
last year and something interesting is

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,520
happening to yesterday's for the energy

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,850
systems there was other infrastructure

46
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,619
areas today the leader negatively leader

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,639
is actually critical manufacturing now

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,750
there are some light at the end of the

49
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,940
tunnel when we look at

50
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,220
an institute hanuman they they asked

51
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,110
leadership and they said well its

52
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,240
cybersecurity costs was a strategic

53
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,910
differentiation and the answer was

54
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,590
seventy-five percent of the leaders they

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,610
asked said well 70 it's cost and it's

56
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,140
only twenty five percent it's really

57
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,300
strategic differentiation however they

58
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,000
also said in three years two-thirds

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,070
we're really differentiating

60
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,110
strategically now that's really critical

61
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,730
and important when we talk about

62
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,500
corporate budgets when you talk about

63
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,810
government budgets to have the right

64
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,780
focus and right priorities we have

65
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,700
significantly increased the investment

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,600
today we talked only in innovation about

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,080
double-digit million-euro investment we

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
have annually between 70 and 100 patents

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,930
only in the security side and investing

70
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,670
and specifically in our automation

71
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,920
products these are numbers which are

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,980
even four-fold of what I just mentioned

73
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,180
in pure innovation for our internal

74
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,220
cybersecurity we are following a strict

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,790
ABC logic we know we cannot protect

76
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,250
every element we call it gold nuggets

77
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,080
you have defined gold nuggets in our

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,480
company that we are protecting those

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,530
golden nuggets are in special centers

80
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,510
where they are protected one is in

81
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,530
munich one is at another site and we are

82
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,150
very purposefully have this in two

83
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,200
separate sites and not one is not very

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,330
well known and it won't be because we

85
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,830
want to make sure that those golden

86
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,120
nuggets are really safe and protected in

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,650
addition we monitor and assist

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,900
internally and our customers with

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,910
so-called cyber defense centers which we

90
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,970
have on all three continents and we see

91
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,459
when there are intruders into especially

92
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,590
again the automation systems the

93
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,530
industrial control systems 2016 we are

94
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,380
marked actually 30 years that we are an

95
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,600
IT security was a very very strong

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,548
increase as I mentioned six years ago

97
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,790
and it helped us this experience

98
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,400
to stretch the security in the

99
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,440
information systems and the automation

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,910
systems have you fully aware experienced

101
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,320
investments priorities will not be

102
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,640
enough it's not an effort of one company

103
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,460
it's not an effort of one country it's a

104
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,130
real team effort there is no limitation

105
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,790
in borders when companies or governments

106
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,040
are attacked the international

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,110
corporation can significantly reduce the

108
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,570
time between the recognition of a

109
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,630
vulnerability in its elimination we all

110
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,700
know there is no protection which is one

111
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,850
hundred percent but only by

112
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,610
collaboration and open sharing and I can

113
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,200
only underline what you said in the

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,570
right circles government academia

115
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,700
business as well as the international

116
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,680
community must cooperate and communicate

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,020
so the megatrends we talked about if

118
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,090
they define how our businesses are how

119
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,790
we develop our businesses and if they

120
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,650
need digitalization and if

121
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,740
digitalization needs to be secure and if

122
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,660
we only can create the security by

123
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,600
cooperating and partnering i would say

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,130
then we are at the right place at the

125
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,050
right time all the best for the

126
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,760
conference today and safe cyber time for

127
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,280
all of you thank you very much

128
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,520
[Applause]
