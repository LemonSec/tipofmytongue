00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,279
president dr. Kemp's the ladies and

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,100
gentlemen it's my pleasure to be here

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,500
and let me say what you are doing

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,900
organizing such a confluence networking

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,140
hosting so many excellent p perform

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,540
Germany Europe and all over the world is

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,680
an excellent idea and no doubt the cyber

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,539
security is key maybe data protection is

12
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,780
important it is but cyber security is

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,570
key and mainly in Germany where laser

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,489
protection has an highest level of

15
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,520
sensitivity they are sent out clear

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,979
signals we have to do more there is no

17
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,920
better we have to invest in hardware and

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,229
software so to come to an higher level

19
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:19,049
of cyber security film munich and munich

20
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,770
security conference is an excellent

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,299
platform to share therefore so to be

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,790
here in these days and seeing what you

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,939
are organizing not only two day it was a

24
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,479
perfect program i could read it but day

25
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,750
by day since a few years near 2's

26
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,880
ministries the state ministry but this

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,640
private public partnership increase your

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,890
toes and scientists within relatives and

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,329
industries this companies are using and

30
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,700
tell serving having a security network

31
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,850
munich the organizing a platform mound

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,170
center just digital / area and a

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,830
platform for cybersecurity all this is I

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,250
think that perfect

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,580
fundament thought to be successful in

36
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,560
this public-private partnership a Munich

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,220
this or the area or Germany be so many

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,680
small and mid-sized companies but these

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,740
companies as cement threw away IBM on

40
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,970
others ass down we I think they can

41
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,000
convince our citizens said cyber

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,270
security needs investments needs ideas

43
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,100
needs standards and needs and common

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,860
approach and so this regional players as

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,340
our area is organizing we have seen on

46
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,640
survey to European eyes digital policies

47
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,320
and two European eyes cyber security I

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,510
see if the membership in Parliament mr.

49
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,840
Foss who was a reporter for data

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,040
protection and who is a driver they're

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,170
pushing all of these efforts in the

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,290
European Parliament we are living in a

53
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,100
digital revolution this in health and

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,360
ml's connecting cars and trucks the

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,000
tuning coming to a future with

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,390
autonomous and automated driving is an

57
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:45,079
IOT with billions of betas with data

58
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,430
economy the sensors this smart devices

59
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,340
and in it therefore trust and confidence

60
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,120
trust and confidence is important a

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,700
small and mid-sized company never will

62
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,090
give share data to X on the cloud if

63
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,700
there is not trust and confidence and

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,150
trust in confidence is coming from

65
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,980
reliable partners and from guarantees

66
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,228
from security from security again taking

67
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:25,830
stealing destroying a data

68
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,830
spying in an opening global market in so

69
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,160
I think for our youth team Union and

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,820
beyond for the globalized economy and

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,840
four hours IV the cyber security is the

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,470
most important technical and legal

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,190
environment by the way for me one of the

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,210
most important places in first

75
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,550
exhibition and fair in employed here

76
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,510
paya specialized on cyber security and

77
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,610
sir technological de la city of new

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,030
litter tomb has excellence for

79
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,240
scientists so here is a environment

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,470
which is really impressive and perfect

81
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,960
my colleague the vice president and

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,120
supports here I think at the beginning

83
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,320
and he I could with its speech mentioned

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,720
our network information security

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,520
directive and our cyber PPP it was an

86
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,450
idea of my extra term for my side to say

87
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,550
here we need a public-private

88
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,060
partnership many challenges can be

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,690
solved by industries in the private

90
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,810
sector others can be the tourist by

91
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,750
regulation or legislation but cyber

92
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,900
security needs them all from the

93
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,760
research sector to the industry from

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,050
governments on regional and national

95
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,970
levels to a European strategy and this

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,110
in a global environment cause at the end

97
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,430
of the day we need in global level of

98
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,910
security cause the internet and big data

99
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:31,129
and detain the economy has no bottle

100
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,849
and lemony and our EU okay they have

101
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,789
world-class global companies such as

102
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,929
mainly as a nice and to give some trust

103
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,729
and confidence is up to you and after us

104
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,419
so we have to continue to work together

105
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,909
in our European research program now

106
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,499
instore isin 2020 he has some money for

107
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,529
to co-finance and photo leverage

108
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:06,059
projects ideas and our calls for

109
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,449
proposals now is open and in our world

110
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,369
program for twenty seventeen eighteen

111
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:14,159
nineteen twenty you can see what we can

112
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:19,110
offer to you to public private between

113
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,580
two universities to research

114
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,439
organizations as how r / max plan for

115
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,459
others here in Germany are so please

116
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,659
come into and contact to our experts for

117
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:38,610
to leverage your word and for optimize

118
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,629
your networking team one point is

119
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,659
important for me another question to do

120
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:51,629
not for today but for our next political

121
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,680
context certification do we need

122
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,899
standards to be neat certification and

123
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:03,389
it is up to our industries to define

124
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,550
them to develop them or do we need legal

125
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,249
definitions legal standards let me

126
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:15,589
confer in our transport sector we have

127
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,519
legislative rules for highways and roads

128
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,939
in our industrial factories their

129
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,759
legislative obligations for companies

130
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,919
photo avoid damages of our work force we

131
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,948
need you pin or even global legal rules

132
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,688
also to say we are moderating the

133
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:42,568
process in its up to our industries to

134
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,900
come to

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,890
the three related standards we are open

136
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,980
but we need clear or of competence until

137
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,350
you get your input what is your

138
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,420
expectation to us in the European

139
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,910
Commission's you'll be in Parliament in

140
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,350
German Bundestag and the state

141
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,780
parliament of terraria and what should

142
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,710
be not up to us so to have flexibility

143
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,000
for to have no privacy to get an advice

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,370
in finding advice in contingent advice

145
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,210
from your site would be really important

146
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,520
for us into political sector and so

147
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,570
let's continue then lets deepen our

148
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,530
exchange of use I think your two days

149
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,910
program is inspiring all of us and

150
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,370
