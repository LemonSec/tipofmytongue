[Music]

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,460
thank you very much indeed and thank you

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,380
for inviting me to speak to you i think

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,559
is the second time that I've spoken at

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,570
this conference so don't think the

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,950
weather was quite a good the last time I

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,480
was here so things are definitely

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,679
improving we've heard a loss I think so

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,689
far this afternoon about the different

10
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,419
levels of cybersecurity so we've looked

11
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,580
at it perhaps it at a megatrend level of

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,910
am also a structural governmental level

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,280
I want to focus in the next few minutes

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,750
just on talking about it from an

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,789
organizational standpoint so I want to

16
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,020
really home in on some of the challenges

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,719
of organizations face and I want to

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,070
offer up as well as some potential

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,350
solutions that are taken from not me

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,789
having turned them up like I have to

21
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,680
come clean from our membership which is

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,420
a you heard a global membership

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,070
stretching from New Zealand right the

24
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,260
way across to the Americas made up of

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,730
primarily in fortune in the Forbes

26
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,760
companies all concerned about issues of

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,650
information security and cyber risk and

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,890
cyber security management so if you like

29
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,299
what I'm saying then of course they're

30
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,729
my ideas if you don't then it's the

31
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,200
membership what can I do so every

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,820
organization understands it's facing

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,020
challenges today what are those

34
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,490
particular challenges what if I were to

35
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,100
pull out for in particular that relates

36
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,740
to to 2017 the source of things that are

37
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,869
keeping our members up at night the

38
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,700
first would have to be the Internet of

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,729
Things what do I mean by that it

40
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,320
operates the number of different levels

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,369
doesn't it it's the Apple watch its

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,020
manufacturing plants I could tell you

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,390
about an isf member who's manufacturing

44
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,520
plants suddenly burst into life during a

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,540
shutdown because somebody hadn't done

46
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,210
the right thing and one of the devices

47
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,369
suddenly thought that because a certain

48
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,020
button has been pressed it was due for

49
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,479
it to come to life anybody who works in

50
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,009
a manufacturing environment knows how

51
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,100
dangerous that can be so the internet of

52
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,659
things I think is becoming very much

53
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,038
more pervasive we don't frankly know how

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,250
to deal with it let's be realistic

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,990
no clue why because most of those

56
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,120
devices were never designed in security

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
in mind never at all I remember having

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,350
conversations when smart metering was

59
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,970
being talked about about the level of

60
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,460
security associated with that I got

61
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,070
blank stares security for people

62
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,660
implementing smart meters is all about

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,920
where is the meat are going to be

64
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,870
located I remember water company same to

65
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,030
me state the reality of security for as

66
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,530
far as the smart meter is concerned is

67
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,440
we don't want to put it next to the

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,270
shower gaining access to the premises is

69
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,130
the is the key challenge so Internet of

70
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,489
Things is upset the second is to cyber

71
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,410
criminal I think two years ago I

72
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,940
described cyber crime as being

73
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,300
entrepreneurial businesses today well

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,570
they've matured they're no longer

75
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,160
startups they are large corporations

76
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,260
they are very very effective at

77
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,239
communicating globally they share the

78
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,230
collaborate we heard a lot about

79
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,270
collaboration the need for it we can

80
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,130
take some lessons certainly from the way

81
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,070
in which cyber criminals do that they're

82
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,310
very happy to outsource if you have a

83
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,170
skill in certain part of the world no

84
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,739
problem solved they happy to commoditize

85
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,209
in terms of the way in which they will

86
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,390
provide you with services so cyber crime

87
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,280
has taken a quantum leap and we should

88
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,380
expect it to do so the impact it will

89
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,850
have on organizations means we have to

90
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,390
be prepared the third element that is

91
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,640
keeping people up at night is obviously

92
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,760
as a regulation not so much GDP are

93
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,470
although there is a certain amount of

94
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,260
work associated with that more for

95
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,150
multinationals and certainly across our

96
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,170
member membership it's about the

97
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,180
difference in standards the difference

98
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,489
in regulation and I think a lot of

99
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,380
organizations have tended to take a

100
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,989
compliance and standards based approach

101
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,730
I can talk about a bank who pretty

102
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,620
regularly every year will tell me about

103
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,420
the breaches that they've had and in the

104
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,680
same breath tell me that they're also

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,540
compliant compliance and in the main

106
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,489
government regulation is normally based

107
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,720
on historical precedent cyber

108
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,880
unfortunately is all about tomorrow and

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,470
the changes it is going to make so if

110
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,250
you adopt a compliance and a standard

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,980
based approach only you will be at a

112
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,100
disadvantage and the final piece is

113
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,920
people up the likes of you and I we do

114
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,330
strange things don't we without

115
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,940
technology people at the back there who

116
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,920
are on their smartphones not sure

117
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,180
whether they're making notes or whether

118
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,260
they're doing some shopping they're

119
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,740
probably doing both is the reality and

120
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,270
from a security standpoint we need to

121
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,770
understand that we need to be aware of

122
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,630
it and we need to adapt our policies our

123
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,550
processes and our procedures to cater

124
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,010
for that there's no good taking approach

125
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,140
akin to King Canute and standing on the

126
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,460
beach and telling the sea not to come in

127
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,360
simply won't work so if those are the

128
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,040
challenges that organizations are facing

129
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,460
what is it that organizations can do

130
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,080
about it how do you as a cyber

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,350
professional deal with I think the term

132
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,910
was moving away from speaking dolphin

133
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,240
how do you do that well most boards

134
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,710
around the world that I talks are very

135
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,280
aware of cyber issues but as I say they

136
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,740
come at it from the issue being that of

137
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,979
compliance compliance I used to work for

138
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:30,880
under some young so I'm allowed a

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,380
service compliance the cost if you're in

140
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,530
the cost bucket then the business will

141
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,700
look at how to reduce you there is no

142
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,940
question that is the nature of it so we

143
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,310
need to get out of the Cross pocket and

144
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,900
we need to get into the investment

145
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,419
bucket that means we have to be looking

146
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,460
at how we can implement cyber controls

147
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,860
and cyber processes in a way that

148
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,810
support the growth of our businesses in

149
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,450
a way that the board can understand and

150
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,700
that means we have to be talking about

151
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,940
the impact of cyber on brand on trust

152
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,040
and on the direction that our companies

153
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,270
wish to go shareholder value if you like

154
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,860
to do that we need to be speaking the

155
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,390
language of the business very often that

156
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,060
happens to be the language of risk if we

157
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,970
can relate cyber to risk then we're in

158
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,689
with something of the chance

159
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,809
furthermore if we can continue to update

160
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,429
that engine light of emerging threats

161
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:31,080
along the lines the ones that I was just

162
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,269
referring to then we stand a chance of

163
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:38,489
remaining current finally we can't do it

164
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,829
alone we have to collaborate there's

165
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,449
been talk of certainly of how we

166
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,179
collaborate across industry across

167
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:47,969
governments I'd like to bring it a

168
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,610
little bit closer to home there are very

169
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,649
few organization that I work with around

170
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,679
the world that I would class as a star

171
00:06:55,679 --> 00:07:00,179
in terms of collaborating internally how

172
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,469
many of you when you see the cyber guy

173
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,329
coming to the water cooler or the coffee

174
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,779
machine suddenly have a phone call to

175
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,329
make for need to go in an opposite

176
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:17,159
direction let's be honest probably most

177
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,449
of you I know I do hey but the reality

178
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,519
is that unless we can embed cyber

179
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,159
hygiene washing your hands or whatever

180
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,959
you want to call it from the top of the

181
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,839
organization the boardroom right the way

182
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,909
down to the guy you'd rather not speak

183
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,009
to at the water cooler and everybody

184
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,449
else across the enterprise we're always

185
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,239
going to be fighting a losing battle so

186
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,319
the way that we have to do this is by

187
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,209
building together our resilience teams

188
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,679
now cyber teams across the enterprise

189
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,839
yes there needs to be a champion in the

190
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,519
boardroom yes there needs to be

191
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,199
representatives from every elements of

192
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,229
the organization from HR from legal from

193
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:54,029
the business units we need to be looking

194
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:56,219
at how we can embed cyber best practice

195
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:57,479
into the way which we go about doing

196
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,309
business and we need to start doing in

197
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:02,969
two decks if we can do that then we can

198
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,379
move on to having the luxury of putting

199
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,229
in place a cyber resilience program that

200
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,300
will consist of governments and planning

201
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,860
that will consist of assessing

202
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,439
situational awareness that will look at

203
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,819
our ability to respond effectively but

204
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,829
unless you actually start with some of

205
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:22,739
those basic ground rules unfortunately

206
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,379
the bad guys will always get the march

207
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,429
on us so that's the message that I have

208
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,469
for you thank you very much indeed for

209
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,120
for listening I hope you found that to

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,308
be useful and look forward to the rest

211
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:35,969
of the program

212
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,360
thank you
