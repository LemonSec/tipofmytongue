00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,839
da conta that is in gentlemen I have the

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,710
joy and the owner of opening this

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,240
reception to the third international

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,410
cyber security conference in unique and

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,119
it has been a pleasure to assume the

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,060
role of the pattern once again I have

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,329
had the privilege of being part of this

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,920
event from the start and never saw it to

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,230
be a sideshow of the Munich Security

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,100
Conference for me it has always been key

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,860
to the discussion of one comprehensive

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,940
security the lineup of distinguished

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,670
speakers and had him these warm

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,449
greetings to all shout cybersecurity has

17
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,600
a rightful place at the very top of the

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,099
agenda in science politics and private

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,540
enterprise when Sherman companies were

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,650
asked about the most relevant risk in

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,140
2017 do you know what the number one

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,810
responsible the risk of cybercrime and

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,930
hacking attacks IT outages spying and

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,500
data meet you that ranked above above

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,610
strikes market turbulence and political

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,869
change such as government transition and

27
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,030
that is saying something especially when

28
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,790
one considers the great uncertainties

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,320
with regards to brexit sanctions against

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,770
Russia the tariffs being discussed in

31
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,630
the United States the opinion polls

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,890
demonstrates how threats and their

33
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,520
perception has changed cybersecurity has

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,490
become a matter of survival for

35
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,170
companies and for public infrastructure

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,840
too by the way

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,300
many people in Germany experience this

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,550
with their own eyes at the end of

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,480
november service suddenly stopped for

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,390
some 900,000 deutsche telekom customers

41
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,920
no telephone no television and no

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,190
internet the intent was to infect root

43
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,720
us but they crashed some people say that

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,780
stopped an even worse custom out an

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,320
outcome yes this attack indeed paralyzed

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,000
everything claim and sympathy and it

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,970
showed many people just how dependent we

48
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,150
have become on data networks and data

49
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,880
flow this was a wake-up call we must

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,100
recognize that attackers and their

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,350
methods are becoming more and more

52
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,980
sophisticated food in 2015 Beverly

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,040
registrated more than thirty thousand

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,280
four hundred cases of computer crime the

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,090
number of unreported cases is much

56
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,190
higher moreover our statistics show at

57
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,800
twenty percent increase over the

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,239
previous year and the French continues

59
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,230
in the first half of 2016 alone nearly

60
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,989
twice as many cases of cyber Spanish and

61
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,550
cyber sabotage became known compared to

62
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,900
the previous year this alarm bells

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,810
cannot be over here we must arm

64
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,209
ourselves here and everywhere and so

65
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,870
it's a great thing that you ladies and

66
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,850
gentlemen have come to Bavaria to Munich

67
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,540
we place a great deal of emphasis and

68
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,500
cybersecurity not yet a month ago

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Germany's federal minister of the

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,060
interior my colleague Tom Artemisia had

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,529
some good news

72
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,680
he is going to set up a central security

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,590
office for information technology which

74
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,720
we carry their german acronym teaches in

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,360
doing so he is reacting to the

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,000
terrorists and criminals who make use of

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,630
the internet having more complex

78
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,330
encryption technologies which can also

79
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,780
be used for our criminal ends are

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,040
placing us before a new channel

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,240
challenges this is not something we can

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
simply allow to continue in the its

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
course a great deal of know-how and

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,140
manpower must be deployed to counteract

85
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,120
the strength the goal is to research and

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,890
develop methods and products and then to

87
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,370
implement them Jesus will provide

88
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,419
consultation and support starting with a

89
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,070
staff of 120 it will grow to 400 over

90
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,610
the medium term that makes it is a

91
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,100
central component in our country's

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,940
security and this new center to stop

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,050
internet risk will be located here in

94
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,250
Munich our state government has

95
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,210
advocated to that end and we helped by

96
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,979
finding spaces and providing the right

97
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,370
infrastructure we see this as an

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,220
accolade for our efforts in

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,760
cybersecurity the agency and its experts

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,820
will receive a very warm welcome here in

101
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,419
Munich ladies and gentlemen had new

102
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,430
agency for something truly necessary

103
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,180
this is a step in the right direction at

104
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,910
the same time Bavaria is committed to

105
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,250
protecting private enterprise by

106
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,700
bringing together research technology

107
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,450
providers and users and to the dance we

108
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,640
ourselves have created a platform for

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,190
cyber security in our digitalization

110
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,770
sensors in the chairman professor

111
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,150
occurred on doctors lavage

112
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,099
where we are improving the capacity of

113
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,499
Bavarian company companies to resist

114
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:36,080
cybertek's creating an understanding of

115
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,590
our threats and supporting the sharing

116
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,770
of knowledge ours is our age of

117
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,580
networking and it's now more important

118
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,879
than ever to learn from one another that

119
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,680
is why we are bringing existing

120
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,560
initiatives such as security network

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,210
Munich marine and the Barbarian IT

122
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,699
security cluster together with our

123
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,729
network from the chamber of Industry and

124
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,770
Commerce and the Bavarian industry

125
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,159
association these networks reach across

126
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,770
Bavaria across Europe across the world

127
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,449
additionally the platform for cyber

128
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,689
security is currently collecting project

129
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:25,039
ideas and defining topics to focus on we

130
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,409
select projects that merit public

131
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:30,169
funding and whose outcome will advance

132
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,740
companies all over Bavaria ladies and

133
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,699
gentlemen please bavaria is home to a

134
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,939
lot of big players digital players today

135
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,629
i attended the opening of the new IDM

136
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,800
Watson Research Center for IOT

137
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,009
technology and last year I attended the

138
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,990
opening of the new sites for Microsoft

139
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,349
and Siemens and the opening of Google's

140
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,649
new development center they have come

141
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,159
here because the value of proximity to

142
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,729
the high-tech customers and because we

143
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,149
are working hard to drive the

144
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,430
digitalization forward with support from

145
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,759
the bavarian state government

146
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,839
digitalization is no longer utopia the

147
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,379
crystallization is open to attack and

148
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,919
let's work together to protect it growth

149
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,649
and prosperity will depend on the sixth

150
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,649
successful digitalization across all

151
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,929
sectors we need new ideas and new

152
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,700
developments to resist

153
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,620
text therefore I'd like to wish everyone

154
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,520
