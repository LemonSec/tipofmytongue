2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,260
you said lock they're simply two types

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,660
of companies there are companies that

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,309
are as we have heard before that I

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,560
hacked there are other companies that

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
just simply don't know that they are

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,560
hacked and there is no other group of

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,130
companies malicious objects from the

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,340
interview subjects we are fighting an

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,058
almost invisible and unconventional

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,960
enemy lurking in the shadows compliance

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,870
and in the main government regulation is

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,679
normally based on historical precedent

14
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,780
cyber unfortunately is all about

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,309
tomorrow ibis acuity is key

16
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,460
maybe data protection is important it is

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,329
but cybersecurity is key

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,069
what executive in any enterprise today

19
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:05,690
can get away with claiming ignorance on

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,240
cybersecurity I think what we need from

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,729
government is a legal framework which

22
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,939
must be open enough for a much more

23
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,100
speedy technical development less

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,149
talking more walking Wendy Sherman

25
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,850
companies were asked about the most

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,380
relevant risk in 2017 do you know what

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,969
the number one responses the risk of

28
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,700
cyber crime and hacking attacks IT

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,630
outages spying and patent issues we have

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,939
to design ourselves out of the

31
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,100
encryption system so that even if the

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,140
government tries to coerce us into

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,120
handing over data we can't
