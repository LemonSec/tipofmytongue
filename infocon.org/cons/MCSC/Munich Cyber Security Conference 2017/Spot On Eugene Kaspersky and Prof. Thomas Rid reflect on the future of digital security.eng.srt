2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,740
and there are many things i like about

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,139
munich but the thing I like most is that

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,389
they usually keep the agenda in flux

5
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:14,709
until the very last minute and then they

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,810
come up with a treat special treat I

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,460
think this panel is a special treat I

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,230
think it's fair to say that we have two

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,000
very distinguished gentlemen here we

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,699
have rocked this world in their

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,830
respective fields eugene kaspersky who

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,300
really doesn't need an introduction here

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,929
in this group and Thomas Reid who has

14
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,740
not just written one of the most notable

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,809
articles on the Russian hacking in the

16
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,340
u.s. election campaign in Esquire

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,739
magazine but has also released a new

18
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,410
book with the german title machine them

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,570
along and as in english it's right of

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,680
the machine so it's a little more

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,199
optimistic I I wonder I wonder what it's

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,000
going to be like in Mandarin because

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,890
it's coming out in Mandarin as well I

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,920
wouldn't let and yes so they will have

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,050
to find our baby I mean we I've learned

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,579
the lesson that it's all faster in the

27
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,680
cyber age so we have exactly 15 minutes

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,270
from this panel and the clock is ticking

29
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,780
so let me fire away with you Eugene if

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,250
you look at the headlines of the past

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,439
few days just as past few days we have

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,110
the discussion in in in the u.s. about

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,630
hacking and intelligence services we

34
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,640
have Chancellor Merkel as we speak

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,650
testifying in Parliament about the NSA

36
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,890
scandal so it's you once spoken of the

37
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:33,340
Dark Age of cyber but that I assume it's

38
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,600
good for business right unfortunate

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,009
unfortunately is and fortunately for you

40
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,290
yeah so basically it's good for your

41
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,490
business model because there is more to

42
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,500
do or what are yes unfortunately or

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,570
there you are sister ain't that the rate

44
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,390
of cybercrime in a very professional

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,040
attack special espionage or very

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,270
professional tax for the financial

47
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,700
services I generates a theory huge load

48
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,340
on the cyber security industry so they

49
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,340
just few numbers every day we collect

50
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,299
about 300,000 malicious objects from the

51
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,960
internet new militia subject 300,000

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,290
every day so that's 300,000 new clients

53
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,130
every day all right

54
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,710
well I didn't say the number of attacks

55
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,750
because every malicious piece can be

56
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,390
used against thousands of 10,000 hundred

57
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,360
thousand tricking so this is the numbers

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,010
are huge unfortunately their world is

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,780
getting to be more and more from the

60
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,820
aggressive environment instead lessly so

61
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,370
what is it like to work in this field as

62
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,580
a russian company these days it's much

63
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,110
more easy than in any other country

64
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:51,000
because the most professional oh no I

65
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,830
may make what Condoleezza Rice once she

66
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,690
wants to say it will help us a lot a

67
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,090
panel and return to me and she said by

68
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,040
the way Russian software engineers are

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,030
the best I agree Russian spoken syllable

70
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,360
of the Russian crackers and cyber

71
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,280
criminals they are worst so available a

72
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
usual we enjoyed it benefits or heaven

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,459
except to the best sources of the fog

74
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,920
but for the engineers and at the same

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,010
time living in the same region I do see

76
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,260
Russia in the russian-speaking America

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,450
so it's a Jew demeanor same region with

78
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,670
the best tracker I got we accessed in

79
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,130
many cases where at just to see the new

80
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,110
technologies new vectors of the attacks

81
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,850
so we are just to recognize that

82
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,190
something wrong is going on so we have a

83
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,830
new definition of course is select we

84
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,420
have to pay double attention for their

85
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,660
for the to be respected Rick Alvarez

86
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,910
country because I know that of course I

87
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,320
don't need to explain that being a

88
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,000
Russian companies here we have to pay

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,660
twice Dobie trusted source of this other

90
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,519
project on technology so we have a new

91
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,080
definition of the best and the brightest

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,080
here at Thomas you as I mentioned you

93
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,730
wrote this article which I think has a

94
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,700
title how they pulled it off or similar

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,290
error how they Russian spilled are

96
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,750
pulled out the big attack in u.s.

97
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,489
electoral history how did they pull it

98
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,820
off well let me just an

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,250
yeah this works let me just quickly

100
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,590
respond to something that Eugene said

101
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,290
and and Eugene did not ask me to make

102
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,580
this statement but I want to make this

103
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,920
statement so you got the bastard you

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,020
know completely kind of actually because

105
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,980
I think what happened in the past couple

106
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,080
of months and especially weeks in the

107
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
United States indeed makes it very

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,350
difficult for a Russian cyber security

109
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,600
company partly because the press

110
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,120
coverage especially in the past week or

111
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,780
two has been extremely counterproductive

112
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,940
you know a degree of conspiracy theory

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,310
in the United States is back in fashion

114
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,620
and especially in the past few days with

115
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,210
a strict with a friction between the

116
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,740
intelligence community and the Trump

117
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,510
administration getting really really

118
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,060
very strong I feel very uncomfortable

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,860
with the kind of press coverage that we

120
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,770
see even in the New York time than the

121
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,210
Washington Post so is saying is

122
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,460
exaggerated or people blaming the wrong

123
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,840
people let me just on kaspersky I own

124
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,260
the company kaspersky I've been working

125
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,760
with many of the threat intelligence

126
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,820
people for many years and I think Eugene

127
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,620
is right they have some of the very best

128
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,110
people in the entire industry well they

129
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,750
do incredible work and and I would just

130
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,030
you know you don't hear this often these

131
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,760
days but I was just caution people to

132
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,100
not just talk about the Russians we

133
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,440
don't talk about the Americans wholesale

134
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,120
we don't talk about the Germans

135
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,520
wholesale this is a very large country

136
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,930
with a lot of different interests in

137
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,820
different companies and so lets you know

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,130
let me cancel when we when we make a big

139
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,660
statement that is a very good point

140
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Eugene you mentioned some of your recent

141
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,610
articles I mean there has been political

142
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,860
propaganda obviously for a long time or

143
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,680
so the sea i th it's a little different

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,890
now because it's easier to politicize it

145
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,660
right because you don't really see I

146
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,670
mean often people don't know who the

147
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,560
perpetrators are or four years it

148
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
doesn't come out so has that changed the

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,410
entire equation well leisure this is not

150
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,170
amused political propaganda is not or

151
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,790
their IPAs partnership betray you

152
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,700
he just as I knew to try to support the

153
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,830
same ideas to dress anything so yes I

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,710
don't want to say that they're the

155
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,780
reason of that society but i think is

156
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,180
just very powerful tool the internet and

157
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,120
all this you noticed i will even use the

158
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,550
definition of the information wars right

159
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,100
right now because in the internet time

160
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,840
it's so easy to access to have access to

161
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,670
any kind of information and it's very

162
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,860
easy to release this information and all

163
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,380
this information and they probably cross

164
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,510
borders very easily this information

165
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,340
while there is hardly any cooperation

166
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,680
between countries on that or is there oh

167
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,930
yes that's exactly the problem elevation

168
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,860
talking about for modern 10 years living

169
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,400
in a cyber age to fight with the cyber

170
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,890
gable there must be very strong

171
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,680
catalyzation between leading nations to

172
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,230
sit together the table and agree about

173
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,350
some basic rules in a cyberspace in

174
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,070
cyber security maybe is one day we will

175
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,020
see that ok so well actually what's

176
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,510
going on is against the cyber crime

177
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,820
there is kappa ratio but it's not enough

178
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,770
it's just a very first step and I

179
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,470
remember the very first converted London

180
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,360
cyberspace conference or in 2011 if you

181
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,420
remember so that I was really happy

182
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,070
because they were the prime minister's

183
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,350
their presidents there was also top

184
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,910
level meeting and they were speaking

185
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,640
exactly the same students that I was

186
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,230
speaking about so 10 years before

187
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,170
finally finally international capitation

188
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,350
against cybercrime their their private

189
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,180
public partnership the information

190
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,270
sharing no it's this is the usual terms

191
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,340
now but I was speaking about that for

192
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,350
four years ready for it happens bed

193
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,210
Tommy's you also take in your book a

194
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,040
very long-term perspective on this whole

195
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,460
thing and and one of your point is that

196
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,610
we have always had and kind of a mixed

197
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,790
you on technology and machines there

198
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,920
were times when people they more or four

199
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,230
ago and they were more pessimistic how

200
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,870
does that I mean what stayed every in

201
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,689
right now

202
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,990
from my work stage a wind right now so

203
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,990
let me let me tease out the detail that

204
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,529
is most of her down to a very practical

205
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,949
when we talked about these high-profile

206
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,220
breaches and you know we many people

207
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,839
here in the audience will know that the

208
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,610
German parliament had made a batch

209
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,800
America has been hacked understand just

210
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,689
before the Democratic National Committee

211
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:59,860
was act in llamo soon by the same / we

212
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,930
re evidence the evidence that links the

213
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,819
two cases in the German Bundestag to the

214
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,620
dnc bridge is very strong that her

215
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,290
command control infrastructure that was

216
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,720
not widely known at the time and it was

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,730
hard-coded the IP address was hard-coded

218
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,720
into the implants you know so I think

219
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,699
when we talk about these high-profile

220
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,709
cases cooker and perpetrated by

221
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,540
political entities by intelligence

222
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,329
agencies we also understand they operate

223
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:29,649
at very high volumes of target and they

224
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,899
make mistakes also criminal how can we

225
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,569
make a second and companies as well as

226
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,459
intelligence agencies and others can

227
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,160
find these mistakes and then analyzed

228
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,199
them in a great level of detail

229
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,870
sometimes very high fidelity and also

230
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,939
certainty about the evidence that we

231
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:49,899
find so often people you know don't

232
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,029
appreciate how much we know about these

233
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,589
operations if you stop digging and

234
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,209
looking very closely so I'm just that's

235
00:09:58,209 --> 00:09:59,769
just a really important point that I

236
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,139
wanted to highlight in the fight against

237
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:07,089
cybercrime Oregon today taxes today you

238
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,610
know this information is a very old what

239
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,379
Eugene mentioned is a very old practice

240
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,970
when today we actually have more

241
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,040
evidence than we had in the world works

242
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,079
for disinformation campaigns in for

243
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,959
espionage be using is possible at let's

244
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,250
assume for example in the upcoming

245
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,100
German electorate of pain many people in

246
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,819
Berlin tell

247
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,729
you well we're going to see similar

248
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,749
cyberattacks you're going to see similar

249
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:31,419
leaks the way we have seen in the US or

250
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,949
so or you're going to see social box

251
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:36,910
being used by right by the parties can

252
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,399
that affect the perspective people have

253
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,589
on this technology that they feel more

254
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,519
frightened that they these people you

255
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,129
mean victims of other in general the

256
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,539
general public yeah so you know I think

257
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,399
Germany right now as well as front right

258
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,589
now in the UK further down the line we

259
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,689
have in Europe we have an opportunity to

260
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,759
learn from some of the mistakes that the

261
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,160
American political system we made

262
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,309
America made I think in Germany is

263
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,229
probably a fair statement to say that we

264
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:10,749
had more coverage by now about fake news

265
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:16,989
than fake means businesses better good

266
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:17,660
decision

267
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,839
[Music]

268
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,189
let good thing because Germans are

269
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,949
probably more alert and aware of the

270
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,139
problem than Americans were you know

271
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,079
nine months ago all right what do you

272
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,850
think oh yeah there are others mistakes

273
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,509
that's way too smart but I mean if you

274
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:35,829
look at this for a cab but in the

275
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,470
aftermath of the German campaign healthy

276
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,970
electric event in the u.s. I think

277
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,369
everybody in Germany of was my

278
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,139
impression has read this article about

279
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,919
cambridge analytica which drum views how

280
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,749
is that I mean how is that affecting

281
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:53,679
people's view on the on technology that

282
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,108
they use very carelessly normally oh

283
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:00,100
that's a good question i don't know

284
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,519
really because well as I don't know what

285
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,439
they did there fortunately people they

286
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:09,039
go to the excesses information I think

287
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,419
that's they are labeled a awareness

288
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:14,649
about the cyber issues is quite high but

289
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,209
I think this is what they mean the main

290
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,869
point is not also rice there the level

291
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,119
of information neverness an ordinary

292
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:25,409
people but people who make a decision

293
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:28,809
the politicians their enterprise but do

294
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:30,249
you have the impression because many

295
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,989
people haven't really changed the habit

296
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:35,289
they still not very careless so you know

297
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,959
it makes it easier for you but do you do

298
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,289
you do this with numbers yeah I don't

299
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,659
know about this route is the recent news

300
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,249
about the lectures and I can come to

301
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:47,229
change the behavior I remember the time

302
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,149
they're also Snowden disclosures and

303
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,859
that has a speech the neighbor says

304
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,239
their audience like a few hundred people

305
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,399
in the audience and ask the question how

306
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,499
many people change the behavior because

307
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:59,889
of the result of disclosure one two

308
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,100
three two cents the people behave in the

309
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,769
same way analytics it doesn't change the

310
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:07,329
people mind so how long will it take

311
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,359
your whatever crap they're all this news

312
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:13,899
they simply led to people to help people

313
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,100
to forget the previous news

314
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,140
the only effect coming it's coming how

315
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,990
many of you a member okay come on you

316
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,650
remember Sonja caption gun so all

317
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,720
the people are gone and sewn into her

318
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,050
throat is emails but but but how do know

319
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,750
who was who was their main victim of the

320
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,340
Snowden disclosures no Julian Assange

321
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,560
how long I'll take your company to hack

322
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,910
into order of TV or whenever tried

323
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,260
whether i should visible never prayed

324
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,520
for that but actually we have the team

325
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,080
of penetration testers were very

326
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,720
professional people and if we have

327
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,520
permission if they have a request from

328
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,550
american government to try the systems

329
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,000
and we cooperate we will do that can

330
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,850
actually lesser we made I'm sorry this

331
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,300
apple apps so we have the survey ship we

332
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,190
do they are security audits and

333
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,370
penetration tests many enterprises many

334
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,240
industrial systems we didn't see any

335
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,910
hundred percent protected secure system

336
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,670
clear anywhere yeah all of them

337
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,040
vulnerable it simply takes time and n

338
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,710
sources to find it the bridge I promise

339
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,750
on here I'd like to bring a theme to the

340
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,370
attention of the audience that I think

341
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,770
is new an extremely important and I

342
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,830
haven't heard discussed today yet on

343
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,980
election night in november nine American

344
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,680
us election night I was in San Francisco

345
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,520
I planned a trip around the election and

346
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,220
of course the city was in shock on the

347
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,440
next the next day with you know Trump

348
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,330
winning the election very unexpectedly

349
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,180
sells really like breakfast to me and

350
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,399
and then on the next day I met around

351
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,920
than the large you know companies

352
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,949
companies that shall remain unnamed and

353
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:16,779
the reaction that I heard several times

354
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,350
was oh my god now we have to treat our

355
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,610
own government like an infosec adversary

356
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,910
now we have to not just be design we

357
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,490
adversary out of the system the crypto

358
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,199
system the encryption system for

359
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,149
instance but we have to design our

360
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,449
shells out of crypto system so that even

361
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,339
if the government tries to coerce us

362
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,029
into handing over data we can't so and

363
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,709
not you know that that's that's more

364
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,329
than end-to-end encryption as designing

365
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:48,790
crypto systems that I essentially on

366
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,639
autopilot once you switch the flip I

367
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,379
said your impression that there's going

368
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,329
to be a confrontational approach in

369
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,529
subside Silicon Valley or and what I'm

370
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,269
saying what I'm trying to say here that

371
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,269
just you you know this sounds drastic

372
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,279
but I think we live we live in drastic

373
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,920
times a lot of people myself included

374
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,059
see liberal democracy under pressure and

375
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,790
rolling black slowly I think that's not

376
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,189
another statement today that has

377
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:20,309
consequences for information security

378
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:23,110
that has consequences for privacy we all

379
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,290
want even in a system that could be more

380
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,000
adversarial than normally what we have

381
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,470
today that is what a lot of people in

382
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,540
Silicon Valley think right now how can

383
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,279
we basically make liberal values in a

384
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,350
liberal democracy into infant into

385
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,680
information system so that in the future

386
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,269
which one could be even darker than what

387
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,660
we have right now privacy and really our

388
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,929
freedom is preserved by technology we

389
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,300
actually could go on for hours but our

390
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,519
time is already running out of one last

391
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,889
questions of ug when you look at Trump

392
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,740
and that debate of the past few days do

393
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,360
you think the Russia connection is going

394
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,959
to bring them down

395
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,630
no idea I'm IT security guys don't ask

396
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,490
me the political question yay i'm

397
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,079
washing of course i motion what's going

398
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,839
on but those asking i don't have the

399
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,079
extra opinion as well we have a private

400
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,420
again I ask our server throw in my

401
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:32,050
kitchen okay yes you may ask me about

402
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,720
who are criminals you may ask me about

403
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,610
the cyber espionage cyber terrorism

404
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,480
about all this time who they are what is

405
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
doing I can't Erica pointed fingers

406
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
maybe for some some areas will find more

407
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,280
information but not about this included

408
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,470
of course I'm curious man and what she

409
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,050
was going on of course of course I

410
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,380
bought popcorn and fish my TV on

411
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,970
expecting the three major election in

412
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,150
year of this year sure that as many I'll

413
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,960
show you is a Russian so I'm watching

414
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,030
from the distance was too much work is

415
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,380
it really so important the way you

416
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,600
phrase the question in a way about

417
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,550
whether you know the Russia kenangan

418
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,620
could bring down from is already I think

419
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,530
quite problematic what we've seen what

420
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,290
we've seen so far is bad enough we don't

421
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,630
need to get ready to see you know some

422
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,510
Jacques secret Russian considers he to

423
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,250
come out that's not going to happen here

424
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,280
when he is done so far well not done you

425
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,980
know tax returns etc that's bad enough

426
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,720
so I mean we don't need to wait forever

427
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,050
more

428
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,710
as a journalist you always have to wait

429
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,220
for mortgage but okay I think that was a

430
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,870
very interesting kickoff we're going to

431
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,430
reassemble in your kitchens it doesn't

432
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,370
get more but oh now I would like to

433
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,350
thank both of you for the brief

434
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,330
introduction and we're going to continue

435
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,220
resolve a larger panel thanks so much

436
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,799
[Applause]
