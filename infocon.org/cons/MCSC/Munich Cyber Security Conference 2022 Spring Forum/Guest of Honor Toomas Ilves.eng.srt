2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
mr president mr elvis also from my side

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,600
welcome back to the secret hall of

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,199
security policy

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
back to munich and before we start about

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
talking about digital security

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,640
uh

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,720
stuff i'd like to

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,039
begin with conventional physical

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
security issues

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
back in 2007 you also were sitting here

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
in the ballroom it was your second year

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
as president of estonia and it was also

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,800
the moment uh in in fact it was in

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,440
february when president putin delivered

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
his inflammatory speech in this hall and

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
literally opened the first chapter of

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
russian aggression in europe and in this

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
time only a few people

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,640
uh took this speech seriously it was you

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,799
your counterparts from eastern europe

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
who warned and about or want of an

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
increasingly

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
aggressive russia in retrospect what

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
could the west have been done better

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
well

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,360
listen to

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,039
central and east europeans a little more

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
but um

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
to this day

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
uh let me start saying that uh i don't

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,119
know how you chose the date but um

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,240
yesterday was the 15th anniversary also

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,479
of the removal of a

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,720
bronx statue in tallinn which uh

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
15 years ago today was then followed by

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
the first

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
to anyone's well i mean publicly known

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,159
state on state

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
ddos attack um

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
before there had been all kinds of uh

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
things that qualified as cyber attacks i

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
mean the moonlight mile and all these

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
things that happened before but those

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
are always kept kind of quiet

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,439
but uh

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,959
on

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,840
april

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
28th uh

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
2007

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
uh uh we woke up and

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
many of our services were down banks

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
were down newspapers were down

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
government sites were down and it was

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,959
a

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,360
it was a it was clear it was a ddos

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,959
attack though we

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
i didn't much know about ddos attacks

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
but i quickly found out

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
uh what's interesting about it when we

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,239
talk about cyber is that if you take fun

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,120
clausewitz's definition of war which is

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
the continuation of policy by other

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,560
means

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
this was clearly precisely a clause of

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,519
itsyan defined war

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,360
and i guess one of the other things that

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,319
is sort of resonates here with

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
the putin speech right up there

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
uh is that when we went to nato to say

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,640
we had the cyber attack

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,319
uh people

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
no one believed us they didn't even know

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
what it was and some countries

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,280
i guess wouldn't know at that time at

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
least wouldn't have known a laptop from

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,080
a toaster oven

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760
so it was uh it was hard to get this

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
across the people

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,720
um

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,400
skipping ahead just to do a little bit

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
of history 2011 is my memory but maybe

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
you remember 2010 but 2011

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,519
was the uh

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
to quote joe nye

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
quoting me joe and i wrote an op-ed in

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
the iht saying

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
the munich security conference held his

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,440
first panel discussion on cyber security

90
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,599
to which

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
someone from a small east european

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,959
country

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,879
that was me said this is the first one

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
but it won't be the last

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,159
so at least i've got something right um

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
in any case just to bring it up to date

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
i just published with uh with the munich

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
security uh conference uh

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,400
an article which i would say uh ukraine

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
has proved completely wrong though i

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,360
think that it still bears uh has a

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
little bit of truth to it

103
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,238
uh in which i claimed that uh that with

104
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,880
the end of the second

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
uh millennium or the end of the 20th

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,600
century we really saw the um

107
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
we saw that we're up to the 20th at the

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
end of the 20th century all conflict had

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
been kinetic i mean with kind of minor

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,479
exceptions but what we have seen in um

111
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,880
since the beginning of the 21st century

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,840
is that

113
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
conflicts are

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
um are well are digitally based which

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
uh changes the entire nature of conflict

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,320
and war i would say because uh if you

117
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
remember your newton's second law uh you

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
know

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
force equals mass times acceleration

120
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
which is equivalent to distance divided

121
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
by time squared well once you get into

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
the digital or cyber realm there is no

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
mass and not to speak of with

124
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
uh there is no

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,280
distance on earth to speak of nor any

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
notable time

127
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
um and so that means the that that in

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,600
turn which we can talk about completely

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
changes the nature of what geopolitics

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,759
is about

131
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
but you still need tanks

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,720
well as i said uh i blew it on that one

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
but

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
one of the things yes that everyone has

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,160
noticed is the minimal

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
role played by cyber attacks in

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,280
um

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
in the ukraine

139
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,800
conflict by

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
i mean on the part of russia which has a

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,039
considerable history of doing all kinds

142
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,639
of things

143
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,520
and not only

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,360
ddos and hacking and doxxing but

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,319
actually hitting critical infrastructure

146
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,639
with the uh

147
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
with colonial oil in the united states

148
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
so i mean

149
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
it's there

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
and certainly we also have enough

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
indications of the russians scouting

152
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,160
transatlantic fiber optic cables and

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
other things so

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
uh but what i would i think my thesis is

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
the reason why you haven't seen it is

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
that the other half of

157
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,199
cyber as it were is that it is a great

158
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
equalizer

159
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
that ukraine may not have i mean it may

160
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,280
have a

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,919
sort of a third of the number of

162
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,039
people

163
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
it may have far fewer tanks but when it

164
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,479
comes to cyber you know they can hit

165
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,039
back and i think that well as we've seen

166
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,880
there's been considerable

167
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
hacking on the part of the ukrainian so

168
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
um

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
yes we have tanks but i think we also

170
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,639
have not seen cyber to its full extent

171
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
possibly because

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,000
um there is some kind of um

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,840
some balance there and they said well

174
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
maybe we shouldn't go too far with this

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
because the ukrainians actually are not

176
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,840
nearly as outnumbered and cyber as

177
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,759
in cyber as they are in kinetics

178
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,400
thank you before we come

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
later again to this topic

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,520
you once you described

181
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,160
april 2007 when you faced this huge

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,800
cyber attack on estonia you described

183
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
that once uh as a blessing for estonia

184
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,280
why

185
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,199
pardon me you described 2007 the 2007

186
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,160
attack as a blessing for estonia well it

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
was a blessing because actually we had

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
been petitioning nato to

189
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
um

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,479
to open a center of excellence for cyber

191
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,120
now nato just so for those who are not

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
nato nato at least at that time i guess

193
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
had at 80 or 81 centers of excellence

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
on different topics uh for example

195
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,560
at that time at least in kiel

196
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
here in deutschland there was a

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
center of excellence for operations in

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
closed and shallow waters which is a

199
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,759
pretty

200
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
specific topic but it was it was a

201
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
center of excellence

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,400
yet there was none for cyber and we have

203
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
been for three years we've been saying

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
come on this is this is this is going to

205
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
be an issue we need to do so in in a

206
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,519
sense it was a blessing because at that

207
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
point nato took it more serious far more

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
seriously and we ended up opening the

209
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,320
uh the the center in thailand center of

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
excellence in thailand for for cyber

211
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
you just mentioned colonial pipeline

212
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,480
we had also incidents in the past take

213
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
for instance solar winds which was

214
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
really divesting

215
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
we are

216
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
in times of war we are in a permanent

217
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,000
causes valley in cyberspace

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
if we look forward

219
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
how do we have to react on that with

220
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,640
comprehensive hackbacks cyber sanctions

221
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,320
well this is one of the most

222
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
argued and difficult issues is do you do

223
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,839
hackbacks or not and up to now most

224
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,120
governments

225
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,680
do not allow hackbacks because of all

226
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
the different problems that can happen i

227
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,160
mean the first one is obviously what

228
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
happens if it's a false flag operation

229
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,279
and then that too is something which

230
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,240
in the cyber world it you can very

231
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
easily do a false flag

232
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
uh attack which you which is much more

233
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,519
difficult if you're on sort of you're

234
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,839
attacking attacking mariopol you know

235
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,839
it's probably not

236
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,640
you know

237
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
it's not saudi arabia doing that whereas

238
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
uh or iran say but in a for with a

239
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
in cyber uh

240
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
we could easily imagine false flag

241
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
attacks so that's something that's been

242
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
tricky

243
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,680
and

244
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
in general it's it's not generally been

245
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
done

246
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
at least in the public sector i don't

247
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
know a private sector might have some

248
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,519
other ideas about that but

249
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,279
i don't know

250
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,959
maybe we'll learn more about that today

251
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,399
from the private sector maybe we'll

252
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
learn more about that today about

253
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
possible hackbacks well then you'd have

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
the equivalent of the wagner mercenary

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,519
group involved too right i guess i mean

256
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,959
but yeah

257
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
you rightly mentioned the wagner group

258
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,839
um let's let's take a look again on on

259
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,920
russia state sponsored hacking

260
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,519
especially that what we see from russia

261
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,839
has always

262
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
always usually mostly carried out by an

263
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,720
unholy alliance of state agencies and

264
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
organized crime actors

265
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
how can we drain this swamp

266
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800
maybe if we separate

267
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
both groups

268
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
take a different look on that

269
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
well i think what we i think our

270
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,160
response needs to be very different uh

271
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,200
not in the particular technology used to

272
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
approach them but

273
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
i mean what we see on the russian side

274
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
is a continuum

275
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,839
of

276
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
of activities beginning with uh

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
the most basic kinds of cyber attacks of

278
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
hacking but then moving on to ddos

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
moving on to then coming out of hacking

280
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
doxing which we saw especially uh

281
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,120
in the 2016

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,720
uh u.s elections also an attempt

283
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
of using hacked materials in 2017 and

284
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,959
the previous

285
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,839
presidential election in france

286
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,880
um

287
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,680
to

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
disinformation i mean and these are i

289
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
mean i hate to talk about the gerasim of

290
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
doctrine because i'm not really think

291
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
it's a doctrine but it it the russia

292
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,480
does use a continuum of these various

293
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
tools that are all

294
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
a function one way or another the

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,120
digital world that didn't exist 20 years

296
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
ago

297
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
um you know even disinformation sure it

298
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,079
existed uh you know so we i mean the

299
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,720
trojan horse is disinformation but

300
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
but i mean if you think about how uh

301
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,240
this fake story about the us and

302
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,720
inventing aids it took six years to get

303
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
from a communist newspaper provincial

304
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
newspaper in india to

305
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,839
the german press i mean it's it travels

306
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
slowly now all these things come out

307
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
constantly but the point is that not so

308
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
much what they do but what we don't do

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
we do not

310
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
we do not cooperate there's a little bit

311
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,279
with the five eyes but as of uh

312
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
also as a brexit

313
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
europe is not even touched by five eyes

314
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
but if you look upon if you look at the

315
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
what the attackers are doing i mean

316
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
basically the two fundamental russian

317
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,959
groups

318
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,160
apt

319
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,720
28 and apt 29

320
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,120
have attacked the state department the

321
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,480
dod the senate or the congress the

322
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,760
bundestag the stiftungen in berlin

323
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
they've attached the dutch for foreign

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,079
ministry they've done the italian

325
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
foreign ministry and on top as an

326
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
instrument of state policy

327
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
they've even done

328
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,120
wata

329
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
the world anti-doping agency so they

330
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
don't care i mean and we and we look at

331
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
this i mean our problem is that

332
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
not only do we not to do things across

333
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,000
disciplines but we don't do anything

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
across borders

335
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,720
every single country has its own thing

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
and we don't you know again with the

337
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
exception of five eyes

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
we're not talking very much i mean the

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
dutch actually have been doing some

340
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
stuff but in general we don't

341
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
and um i mean a good example of that is

342
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
uh when we discovered in estonia a worm

343
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
was about 2011 or so a worm a russian

344
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,120
worm in our military network and we went

345
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
to nato and

346
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,399
and said look we discovered this worm

347
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,920
and nato's response was oh you too

348
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,959
this is not the proper response

349
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,480
um so i think that i mean i'm told that

350
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,600
things have improved since that time

351
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
um

352
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
but nonetheless uh the my point is that

353
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
we do need to

354
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,320
take these things uh i mean we need a

355
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
hell of a lot more cooperation across

356
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
borders than we have

357
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
and we have very little of it so

358
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,839
that would be my

359
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,480
take on it and indeed you are advocating

360
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
for even the longer time for system of

361
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,560
collective security uh in in that sense

362
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,880
maybe also this day is very symbolic

363
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
today um

364
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
as far as i know europe japan south

365
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,560
korea australia and the us will launch a

366
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,639
new initiative

367
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,880
sort of declaration for the future of

368
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
the internet outlining a series of

369
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
democratic principles first that sounds

370
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,399
of course good but i wonder is that

371
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,360
enough

372
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
is it really enough do we need a better

373
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,600
cyber nato or something like that

374
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
well

375
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
i mean i think we have to go look beyond

376
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
something like nato because recall that

377
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
nato is the north atlantic treaty

378
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,199
organization it is the north atlantic

379
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,519
treaty organization not that we are also

380
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
wonderful in this region though we are

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
of course

382
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
but nonetheless it's because of

383
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,600
bomber range

384
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,480
flight fighter refueling

385
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
tank transport

386
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,399
troop logistics

387
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,959
that's why it's the north atlantic or uh

388
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,160
treaty organization and that's why japan

389
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,920
and south korea and taiwan and australia

390
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
and new zealand are not in nato if

391
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,600
people say why aren't they in nato well

392
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,880
that's because we keep thinking about

393
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,600
common values and those states do have

394
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,079
common values but we are we are

395
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,800
restricted actually by geography

396
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
now when we get to

397
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
the the cyber realm

398
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,720
as i said you know you eliminate

399
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
mass you've eliminated distance you've

400
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
eliminated

401
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,480
time as an element which means that um

402
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,680
i love this

403
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,920
tallinn torino toronto and tokyo are all

404
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
and toledo i guess i should put in there

405
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,959
too

406
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,920
to keep americans happy and tokyo are

407
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
all equidistant

408
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,720
there is no i mean there there are

409
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,880
microseconds indifference in uh in an

410
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
attack on any of those cities

411
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,759
now if that is the case then um then

412
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
maybe we should come up with some other

413
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,959
way of grouping countries

414
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,000
based on values so that you would cover

415
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
all of those that i mentioned but other

416
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,160
democracies as well i mean why you know

417
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,559
uruguay is actually fairly developed

418
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,679
digitally

419
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240
and it's a fine liberal democracy why

420
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,959
don't we invite uruguay too um and of

421
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,640
course nato does have a few problems i

422
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
won't get into for political correctness

423
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
reasons with some countries in nato that

424
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
perhaps don't always come match the

425
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
values of the purported values of the

426
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
north atlanta treaty organization but i

427
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
would very much like to see

428
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,360
something on

429
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,080
moving in this direction that would

430
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
allow far more cooperation okay it won't

431
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
be five eyes but seriously let's not

432
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,799
have events such as oh

433
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
you you discovered that too anymore i

434
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
mean that's the kind of thing we want to

435
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
get away from

436
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
we're also getting away from time yeah i

437
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,559
think

438
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,799
the organizers would allow two three

439
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
more minutes because it's really nice to

440
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
talk to you um

441
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,160
mr president if we take another look uh

442
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,120
data

443
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,880
data is also a huge issue and um you

444
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
once wrote the real issue with big

445
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
brother is not so much the state

446
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,480
collecting data as our own behavior

447
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
well actually i said the real problem is

448
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
the little sister who knows everything

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,559
about you and tells everybody else

450
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
which is what i sort of coined to talk

451
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
about um

452
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,840
facebook uh which basically i mean

453
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
i mean

454
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,880
as we all know for ever since 2016. i

455
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,039
mean they're sucking up all our data and

456
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
they're selling it and

457
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
and that's the little sister uh

458
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
and the state actually does fairly

459
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,240
little and in fact uh there are

460
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
considerable mechanisms you can buy for

461
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,559
example in estonia on any of the systems

462
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,840
that we have that are state

463
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
based on the state system we have

464
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
reciprocal

465
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,080
mutual transparency so i can see whoever

466
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
is looking at my data

467
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
and if they're looking at the wrong

468
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,480
things they get arrested

469
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
but in any case

470
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
data the other thing i mentioned about

471
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,039
data is that

472
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
there has been especially in europe

473
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
especially in this country in obsession

474
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,120
with privacy which

475
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
i have nothing really about private i

476
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
don't really have anything against

477
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
privacy but i think we're looking at the

478
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
wrong issue

479
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
we should be looking at data integrity

480
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,760
which is far more crucial

481
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,840
data i mean privacy is someone publishes

482
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,480
my blood type or my bank account you

483
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
know it could be embarrassing and blood

484
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,799
type who cares

485
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,120
if someone changes the record of my

486
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
blood type or someone changes my

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,080
bank account and certainly probably not

488
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
for the better

489
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
um

490
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
that is a problem and we need to pay far

491
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,679
more attention to data integrity than we

492
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,880
have and so when we talk about data

493
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,280
instead of obsessing about privacy i

494
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
would like to be i would like to see a

495
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,840
far greater concern on

496
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,159
data integrity though of course data

497
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,240
privacy is important too since we see

498
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
the country places with weak cyber

499
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,159
security

500
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
be it the private sector like the

501
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
equifax hack or

502
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,600
or the state sector like with the opm

503
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,240
act that was i don't know 20 odd million

504
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,480
federal employees past and present

505
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,760
including psychological profiles of cia

506
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,880
agents all held in one database and in

507
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
clear text not even

508
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
encrypted i mean this shows that states

509
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
need to think a lot more yeah it's

510
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
ironic that right now elon musk is

511
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
crying twitter for 44 billion uh us

512
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
dollar he could have downloaded the app

513
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
for free of course but

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
um so uh we we are unfortunately running

515
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,240
out of time maybe one one very brief uh

516
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
question as uh we also should take a

517
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,679
look on germany's role in cyberspace and

518
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,110
after all we really like to lecture

519
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,840
[Music]

520
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,720
but

521
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,880
on the other hand that makes a view of

522
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
our country from outside all the more

523
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,080
valuable what's what's your point of

524
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
view what's your perspective on germany

525
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,840
and its cyber security

526
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,440
achievements and strategies

527
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
well i think every country ultimately

528
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,919
will have to first will will need to

529
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,600
develop

530
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,799
a strong

531
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,919
state

532
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,360
run most likely robust system that it

533
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
would have three components

534
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
one is a

535
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
secure

536
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,679
uh a secure digital secure you everyone

537
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
would have a secure unique digital

538
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
identity

539
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
and then encrypt that would communicate

540
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,240
with end and encryption and with uh

541
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,799
minimally two-factor authentication then

542
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,600
you which which is

543
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,640
slowly coming into existence in europe

544
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,120
uh it's not required but it's urged

545
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
with the adas directive it doesn't exist

546
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,120
in the united states at all even though

547
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
i think they've missed a lot of

548
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
opportunities to do that

549
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
then secondly you need to really impose

550
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
a distributed architecture so you don't

551
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
have a repeat of the

552
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
opm hack but more broadly that you don't

553
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,039
store it all in one place as an

554
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,799
elementary cyber security thing and the

555
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
last thing is of course

556
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,559
guaranteeing data integrity so in my

557
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,400
country all critical data

558
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
including all citizens health care data

559
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,120
all laws because if you think about what

560
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,360
happens if someone changed the laws or

561
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,280
something uh are on a

562
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
permission blockchain

563
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,559
so

564
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,919
there those are things need to be done

565
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,400
now when you say ask about germany

566
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,559
um the problem is that you need to be

567
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,960
able you need to make this minimally uh

568
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,840
sort of

569
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
national i mean the problem in germany

570
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,240
is you have all these you have 16 lender

571
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
and if each one has its sys i mean

572
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
whenever i talk to people who deal with

573
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
these issues in germany when i say well

574
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
you know this is something it would be

575
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
really good to do they go well you don't

576
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,159
understand we have 16 lender and we all

577
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,120
have different systems

578
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,440
especially since what our ultimate goal

579
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
should be

580
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,039
is that at least some of these services

581
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,679
should be cross-border

582
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,679
in the european union

583
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,840
for example i mean our digital

584
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,360
prescription

585
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
which we have in estonia works with fin

586
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,000
also is i mean is mutual works mutually

587
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,400
with finland and bizarrely enough

588
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,840
portugal and croatia um i mean why that

589
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
happens much of that is legal rather

590
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,880
than

591
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,159
technical

592
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,320
uh but nonetheless we need to be moving

593
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,960
in that direction and so the first uh

594
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
the first challenge i would say for

595
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
germany is to

596
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,600
at least get a national system going

597
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
thank you so much a lot of food for

598
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,200
thought for this afternoon

599
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
thank you that was president thomas

600
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,880
elvis from estonia thank you so much

601
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
that you took the time to travel to

602
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,480
munich to speak to us thank you

603
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,490
