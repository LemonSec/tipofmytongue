2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,719
i'd like to introduce chris krabs who

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,639
today runs his own company but until

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,680
recently has been the director of the us

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
government's

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
cyber security and infrastructure

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,880
security agency

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
it's a very uh colorful task as i heard

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,519
then here we have a

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,840
helmet clara who is the chief enterprise

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
information security architect of the

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
austrian railways

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
definitely a critical infrastructure

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,079
then i would like to welcome

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,480
patch who is the branch chief in the

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
cyber and i.t i cyber i.t department at

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
the federal ministry of defence in

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
berlin

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,879
and i also like to give a warm welcome

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,680
to jeff brown the former chief

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
information security officer of the city

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
of new york

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,840
and uh

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
in your administration though

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
where i understand as many public

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
servants as in half of munich that's a

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
pretty big organization

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
so you see a lot of practical experience

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
here um on this podium

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,920
our focus here now is not global theory

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
but it's um the operational aspects the

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,920
pragmatic aspects and the first question

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
i would like to ask

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
and it's kind of an obvious one

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
that's perhaps in everyone's mind to

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
falker

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,920
russia's invasion of the ukraine

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
how does that change

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
how we need to deal and think and deal

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
with the threat

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
of our critical infrastructures we all

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,720
know what critical infrastructures are

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
organizing democratic elections are also

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,159
kind of a critical infrastructure

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
and i would just like to remind everyone

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
that in the ue eu we have just learned

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,960
how dependent we are on russian gas

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
if we consider telecom

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
a critical infrastructure

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,640
in germany

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
most of our 5g infrastructure is being

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
built on chinese technology

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,280
is that something we want

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,239
um

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
have our leaders got the right mindset

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
so folker what do you think um how does

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
the ukraine invasion change the way we

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
need to deal with critical

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
infrastructures

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
so now being safe from the mouse you

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
still put me in danger of a lot of

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
questions but um i still take just the

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
first one

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
to set off and i would have a very short

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
and boring answer

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
the ukraine war hasn't changed anything

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
because and i think we already heard

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
that today

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,360
there is

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
to be really precise there is nothing

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
new we see at the moment what we see in

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
ukraine is a full-scale war fought in

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
the cyber information room domain as

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
well as in traditional domains alnc

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,239
by

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
doctrines which have been

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
written down in nato and under under

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,040
other countries over the last years

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
which have been excessively

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
war gamed

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
and which are now played out in front of

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
us so

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,879
short shortest answer could be nothing

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
has changed but of course that would be

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,120
wrong because a lot have has changed and

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
we already hit that today

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,800
also

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
but it's a lot about perception

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
we knew about these threats we knew

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
about the importance of critical

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,799
infrastructure and the importance to

92
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
protect critical infrastructure to

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,239
prevent effect attacks and to be able to

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,879
bounce back from attacks so to survive

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,799
to operate

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,680
but

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,159
i think what we lacked ins at least and

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
please take this as a little provocation

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
what we lack was the sense of urgency

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
and sincerity in

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,080
doing something out of this

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
knowledge

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
and this

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
i think has changed or at least i hope

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
this has changed and it will stay

106
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,200
changed because it will decide

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
if the green war can have at least a

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
small a very small positive point

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
if we are able to bring all these things

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,519
together

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,478
and really go a step forward i mean we

112
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
heard that in the introductory note

113
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
a new social contract

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
and there's a lot which has to be done

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
and coming back to my own profession of

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,360
course we as a military have a lot to do

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
and i hope we are doing it right now in

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
mind you all heard about the special

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,120
fund announced by our chancellor and uh

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
debated right now in the parliament the

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
extra 100 billion you mean yeah exactly

122
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
thank you

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
and it probably doesn't come as a

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
surprise that we at last at least are

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,720
planning to put a very heavy emphasis on

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,520
means of digitalization and especially

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
communication and control

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
but again

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
it's it's not something only for the

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
military it's not only something for the

131
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
state it's something for the

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
for the community as a whole

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,840
and there i think really we have a

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
change in perception and now it's the

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,840
time to to use this change

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,479
so no change but a different perception

137
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,759
is there anything you'd like to add from

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
a us or your personal experience i i

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,800
agree with that in general i think the

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
perception from the government side at

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
least when i sat in government was more

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,400
of a security maximalist position so you

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
know you mentioned a chinese

144
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,039
telecommunications company that's

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
building out german and other european

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
uh telecommunications networks it's

147
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,039
because the economic incentive

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
structures

149
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
lead to that

150
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
it is too difficult to go to the

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,960
alternative either from availability of

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,440
production runs or just the sheer cost

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
of it

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
so

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
when you come back from it from the

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
private sector side you have to look at

157
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
it from a p l perspective and you know

158
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
what are the economics of the deal and

159
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
security costs money security is

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
friction security is seen is an

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
impediment or a barrier to doing what

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,039
private sector businesses are supposed

163
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
to do and that's

164
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,720
make money and deliver value to

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,919
shareholders

166
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,680
so until i think we can solve that

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
equation

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,520
absent any other external factors will

169
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,160
continue to be in this mindset all that

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
said

171
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
i do think that

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
the last two and a half months

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,199
have dramatically changed the way

174
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,240
corporate leaders think about risk like

175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
cyber risk like dependency upon

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
untrusted sources of technology

177
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
and they're making

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,680
different decisions

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,880
in what markets they want to be in

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,039
russia you're seeing this mass exodus

181
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,919
from russia and those same companies are

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,440
thinking now about like well what's the

183
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
next geopolitical flashpoint that i need

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
to be bracing for

185
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
um

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
and then and then the second piece is

187
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
not just what markets i want to be in

188
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
but where do i want to source my

189
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
technologies

190
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
that help drive my innovations so i am

191
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
seeing an awakening

192
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
i thought last summer i would have seen

193
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
a greater awakening with colonial

194
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
pipeline and how cyber is a business

195
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
risk not just a technical risk but now

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
we're seeing it as

197
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,199
this is a public perception risk this is

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,160
a stakeholder risk this is an esg risk

199
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
this is a social incorporate

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
responsibility risk so cyber

201
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
is now up into the big leagues of risk

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
management theory at least is

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
at least we're getting there

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
how do you how would you um from a new

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
york city point of view look at this

206
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,639
does ukraine change anything or would

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
you say same thing except as before

208
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,759
except more sense of urgency

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
i think the answer that question is

210
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
building on the previous two points and

211
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
to sum it i think it comes down to

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,360
tolerance and accountability

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,639
accountability

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
if you think about it what is becoming

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,479
unbelievably

216
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,800
uh apparent as we all think about the

217
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
war in ukraine

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,080
is there is a very low tolerance thank

219
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
goodness

220
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,560
for the types of impacts that cyber and

221
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
other types of conflict can have and

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
what people depend on what people depend

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
on is the critical services that are

224
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,319
provided by their governments and the

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
critical services that are provided by

226
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
the private sector so that's the first

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
part what is the tolerance and i think

228
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,360
people are waking up that there are

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
things that we do not tolerant tolerate

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,599
so we have to do something about it

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,679
and the second piece is accountability

232
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
and we're also seeing that uh for years

233
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,519
we've talked about public-private

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
partnerships and what we're realizing

235
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,279
now is government private sector we're

236
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
both accountable and in order to meet

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
that accountability to the people that

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
depend on us to be successful we have to

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
work together

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
some of you have would you like to add

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
i fully agree with

242
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
this topic because the

243
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
companies of critical infrastructure and

244
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
all other companies can do their

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
homework but for

246
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
bigger issues we need support from

247
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,320
military or from government and it makes

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
it covers um one topic that we have to

249
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
act together we build up knowledge

250
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
together we have act together we have

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
fight together maybe it's the wrong word

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
but we have to

253
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
run cyber war

254
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,360
against companies and hacker and this we

255
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
can only solve in a

256
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
common way

257
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
some of you have spoken to a sense of

258
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
urgency and prioritization i'd like to

259
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
come back on that point

260
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
to me cyber security is a c level a top

261
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
level

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
issue

263
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
you see the right mindset

264
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,080
with our political leaders

265
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
political leaders i mean what country

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,240
it depends

267
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,040
i

268
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,439
i

269
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
so

270
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
look the the kind of war college

271
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
monographs i've used that line before

272
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,279
that will be written about the invasion

273
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
of ukraine will be fascinating what were

274
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
the intelligence wins what were the

275
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
intelligence losses i think the us

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
intelligence community with some of the

277
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,720
five eyes partners got it absolutely

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
right on what russia was intending to do

279
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
in ukraine others did not necessarily

280
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,560
buy into it what i think we missed was

281
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,600
um you know how the the resilience of

282
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,320
ukraine and the lion of kiev and

283
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
zielinski we missed that and that's at

284
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
least my take

285
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
um

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
how does that though transition into

287
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
this the messaging and the sense of

288
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
urgency from political leadership into

289
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
those at least in the united states that

290
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
own and operate critical infrastructure

291
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,000
and can and can the critical

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,760
infrastructure owners and operate

293
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,279
actually

294
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,640
action

295
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
the guidance that's coming from

296
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,720
government and the plea that i've made

297
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,519
is that you as a critical infrastructure

298
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
owner operator that are supporting the

299
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040
economy in society have a responsibility

300
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
to ensure that you are hardened and you

301
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,279
are not a distraction

302
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,000
to

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
the political leadership and the the

304
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,560
government that is supporting

305
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
the ukrainians because the successful

306
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,320
cyber attack by russia on a u.s asset is

307
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
going to not just have a disruptive

308
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
effect on the critical infrastructure

309
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,120
it's also going to be a political

310
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
distraction it's going to lead to civil

311
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
and social unrest in the united states

312
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,880
it is on the we're coming up on a mid

313
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
critical midterm election in 22 well

314
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
that would be fodder

315
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,839
in the election so everyone has a

316
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,120
responsibility to heart be a harder

317
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,399
target

318
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,560
i think that's in part where we

319
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,000
there's a gap there's a delta

320
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,639
oh i would

321
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
gladly

322
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
go on with that because i really think

323
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
we have to be fair we have to be fair to

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
our politicians as well as to ourselves

325
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
um and that's that's the reason why i

326
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
talked about urgency

327
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
as the main

328
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,399
changing factor of perps

329
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,800
it's not that we didn't do anything in

330
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
the in the past

331
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
look for example at germany of course we

332
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,760
have

333
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
implemented

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
our cyber defense center on a federal

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,639
level to exchange information between

336
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
different uh parts of the federal and uh

337
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
and the state administration very

338
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
quickly concerning cyber threats and i

339
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
think it's

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
definitely not perfect but it's a very

341
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
good first step

342
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
again coming back to the to the armed

343
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,320
forces of course we have our

344
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,519
architecture already encompassing ideas

345
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,360
like zero trust

346
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
or

347
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,120
security by design or whatever

348
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,800
you all can name them

349
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
we've got them

350
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,519
in the past it's been just a question

351
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
about prioritization

352
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
and it's

353
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
not so different between private sector

354
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,399
and us

355
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
it always comes bound down to the budget

356
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
and the question

357
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
what do i do with the budget or more to

358
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,680
be more honest what can i do and what

359
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
have i do to do

360
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,279
at this moment with my available budget

361
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,959
and um as a private company has to

362
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,119
to

363
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
yeah be held accountable by by their

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
shareholders

365
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
we are held accountable by the taxpayers

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,079
so it's more or less the same situation

367
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
and we we did all this

368
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
but hopefully now we will be doing it

369
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,959
faster and again with a with a much

370
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
more sense of urgency and that's the

371
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
real difference so i wouldn't say we did

372
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,160
something really wrong we had to

373
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,600
prioritize

374
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
and this prioritization was done of

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,760
course you could say why wasn't more

376
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,079
money given to this

377
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,040
but

378
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,639
to be fair and honest you would also

379
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,160
have to answer the question where does

380
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
this money come from

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
and where do you take it away from

382
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
and that's when it gets

383
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,639
a little bit more complicated to answer

384
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
if i could add to this um just

385
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
having worked in the de blasio

386
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
administration in the city of new york

387
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,839
and you have to think about the city of

388
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,240
new york nine million people 100 plus

389
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
different departments and agencies 340

390
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,800
000 employees it's a 90 billion dollar

391
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,839
enterprise

392
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
what really resonated from a political

393
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,320
perspective was a simple question and it

394
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,720
goes to the social contract conversation

395
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,639
from earlier what do new yorkers depend

396
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,240
on they depend on core services shelter

397
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
healthcare justice

398
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
transportation water and the question

399
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,519
that came was can this all get disrupted

400
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
by a cyber event the answer of course is

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,760
yes and to the point when it comes to

402
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
the application of budget what we

403
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,199
observed is as we were given the

404
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
centralized authority within the cyber

405
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,600
security organization we were also given

406
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,120
the opportunity to help the city

407
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
rationalize not how it was spending on

408
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,639
cyber security dividends but how it was

409
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
spending on technology and the reality

410
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,720
is as we adopt technology on behalf of

411
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
our citizens or our clients we are going

412
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
to spend more and more and more on

413
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
technology so if you rationalize that

414
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
and you bake security in from an

415
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
engineering perspective from a process

416
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
perspective at the very beginning you

417
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,440
might find that you're actually spending

418
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
taxpayer dollars or profits from the

419
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
private markets with much more precision

420
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
that in fact is better so i think to a

421
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
certain extent the whether politics or

422
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,360
corporate structures when you add the

423
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
economics of the discipline into it you

424
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
may find benefit

425
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
all right thank you

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,199
kristin and jeff you mentioned

427
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,399
technology is technology sovereignty

428
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
a way forward how does that play into

429
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,600
cyber security

430
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
in terms of

431
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,480
exporting chips supplying our

432
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
trips or systems

433
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,959
from countries that we may or may not

434
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,880
trust

435
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,720
nobody in their right mind would source

436
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,240
our weapon systems from hostile nations

437
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
what about our critical infrastructures

438
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,000
so

439
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
how do you think technology sovereignty

440
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,680
comes into play here

441
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
is that an issue so

442
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
sorry

443
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
technology sovereignty there's a bit of

444
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,839
duality of meaning here so

445
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,399
there's one meaning where

446
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
technology sovereignty means you're

447
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,279
dictating a certain

448
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
indigenous proportion or percentage of

449
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
technologies used in your government in

450
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,040
your industries the chinese do that

451
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
they've established percentages the

452
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
russians are working to do trying to do

453
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
that as well

454
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
the flip side

455
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,160
uh definition is that you kind of have

456
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
dominion over the technologies that are

457
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
used within your enterprises in their

458
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
trusted

459
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,040
and i like to think of that more as a

460
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,079
democratization of technology with a

461
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
really heavy emphasis on

462
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,480
the democracy piece and i think that's

463
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,360
where

464
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
there are opportunities

465
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,959
down the road

466
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,039
for and we're seeing this in part in the

467
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,959
5g conversation

468
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
of how do we establish a com you know a

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
set of common

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,559
nations that have shared values of civil

471
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,039
liberties transparency and rule of law

472
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
that can come together and say these are

473
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
the these are the principles that that

474
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
we want in our technologies our

475
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,439
technology providers

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,240
uh and and then you you can incentivize

477
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,200
the the innovation piece uh you can you

478
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
can address some of the economics

479
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
because no single country is going to

480
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
create a national champion in 5g

481
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
technologies that can own the market

482
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
alone right now outside of china it's

483
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,640
just it's

484
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
not possible so instead how do you build

485
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
that trading block and it is not going

486
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
to be just the us

487
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,559
in europe you know india is a key player

488
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
here the global south is a key player as

489
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,120
well but you have to fix those inverted

490
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
economics with heavily subsidized loans

491
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,240
predatory uh well pricing and then

492
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,039
predatory loans so how do you get there

493
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
like i said you build that block but you

494
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,480
also have to do it on the flip side

495
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
where you disincentivize

496
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
the behaviors

497
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
that have led to

498
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
digital authoritarianism you hold them

499
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
accountable you hold the chinese

500
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
accountable force

501
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
intellectual property theft

502
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,760
in in commercial uh you know tech

503
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
transfer and one way i've thought about

504
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,039
doing this is 2019 company crowdstrike

505
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,480
released a report on how the comax c19

506
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
which is a airplane they've sold for

507
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
regional jet uh it's comprised of about

508
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,840
26 different technologies half of them

509
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
are stolen from western companies

510
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,799
so there's a block then of democratic

511
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,520
nations of these shared values that say

512
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,160
you're you're not available to trade

513
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
that technology because we can attribute

514
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
and demonstrate so we've got to have a

515
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,039
little bit more creative uh thinking

516
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,120
around the incentives and who's in and

517
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,039
who's out

518
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
any other views

519
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
yep definitely i mean uh

520
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
i think nobody will discuss the bond

521
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
that we need

522
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
sovereignty or

523
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
yeah let's let's stick with the term

524
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
sovereignty but as chris already

525
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,840
mentioned the first question is whose

526
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
sovereignty are we talking about

527
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
nato eu europe germany

528
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,760
a coalition of a

529
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
i don't know number of states

530
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
sharing the same values

531
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,039
as a military guy i say i need serenity

532
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
because i do need to know that my

533
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,520
systems do what i want them to do and

534
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
only what i want them to do

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,799
question is how do i achieve this state

536
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
i can do it by

537
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,760
knowing it from the scratch

538
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
goes in the direction of security by

539
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,320
design and so on or by owning everything

540
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
which is in it i can do it which is very

541
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
cost intensive and time intensive by

542
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,960
certifying everything i buy afterwards

543
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
which could be argued isn't safe hundred

544
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
percent

545
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
i know that

546
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
um but again i think it's all about

547
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,679
practical practical practicability sorry

548
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,720
um and what we can achieve in a certain

549
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
amount of time

550
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
um we have a certain need this is to be

551
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
sure about what we use

552
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
and now it's about to how we can fulfill

553
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,480
that and again it's perhaps about the 80

554
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,799
solution and not about the 100 solution

555
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,600
so that's the reason why sovereignty

556
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
which means 100 percent

557
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,400
i sometimes take as the wrong term

558
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,280
okay

559
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,559
thanks

560
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,600
another thing that's on my mind is um

561
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
how is their way to overcome the skills

562
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,640
gap

563
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
between the public and private cyber

564
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
security staff on the one hand

565
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
uh the public sector has a public

566
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
mission

567
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
but they may not be able to attract all

568
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
the right talent like has been mentioned

569
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,559
before

570
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,840
on the other hand the people in the

571
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,400
private sector may have the skills

572
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,880
but they may have other motives not

573
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
necessarily the public interest at heart

574
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
any of you or not jeff perhaps

575
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,799
i think as an individual i've certainly

576
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,679
personally professionally benefited

577
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
from exposure to both the private sector

578
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
and the public sector and i think the

579
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,159
intersection of both

580
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,280
those

581
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,840
sort of pursuits

582
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,679
can be the mission

583
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,400
and to a certain extent as i think about

584
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,159
the ability to grow a workforce in the

585
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
public sector the public sector has an

586
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,799
incredible amount of credibility because

587
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,720
they have the authority to say

588
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640
we are serving the people that's an

589
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,120
incredible driver of mission

590
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,080
and

591
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,120
as

592
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,039
the private sector

593
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,120
participates in that through its great

594
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
innovation advising capabilities you

595
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
start to see this wonderful

596
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,679
exchange and as long as you're

597
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,159
offering open doors between those two

598
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
pursuits then people can grow in their

599
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,600
careers i certainly think that you can

600
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,640
get

601
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,760
unmatched training across a whole set of

602
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,440
disciplines if you're in the public

603
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
sector and you can have terrific like

604
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,640
benefit experimentation

605
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
um and really practical application in

606
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
the private sector so as long as the

607
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,880
conversation's happening between both

608
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
and you're pulling and pushing then you

609
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
can grow an absolutely fantastic

610
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
workforce

611
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
other views has it been an issue in

612
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
where you work

613
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,520
the

614
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
advantage of austria is it is a small

615
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,000
country so we don't have this problem

616
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
between public and private partnership

617
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
not because we are working together we

618
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,159
have a lot of models of private public

619
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,440
partnership

620
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
and there are also groups

621
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
we are as

622
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,320
companies

623
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,360
give inputs for the official parties how

624
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,640
can we

625
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
made models

626
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
or guidelines they are real working in a

627
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,919
good and effective way for us

628
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,080
so the private public partnership is

629
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,120
very high established in austria

630
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,840
but there is a second point

631
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,760
you said before the austrian railway is

632
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
part of the critical infrastructure in

633
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,799
austria and our mission forced by the

634
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,159
stakeholder

635
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,000
and and and honor the austrian

636
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,360
government is

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,840
to keep the society and the economic

638
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,879
industry up and running

639
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
so for this we have to transport good

640
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,240
and passengers from a to b in a safe and

641
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
secure way

642
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,919
so it sounds like very simple and it is

643
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,919
a pretty cool and sexy job but we have

644
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,440
to handle with a lot of different

645
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
technologies

646
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
um complex systems and we have to handle

647
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,679
with people's life

648
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,279
so

649
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,080
an independent if you have a pandemic

650
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,360
independent of critical uh or political

651
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,320
let's say independences

652
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,120
or nature hazards and so on nobody would

653
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,440
ask how can we fulfill them but we have

654
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,720
to fulfill them and we are responsible

655
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
for this kind

656
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,360
the good news is we invest a lot of

657
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
money in systems

658
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,640
in infrastructure and in cyber security

659
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,679
but

660
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,880
the bad news are if we invest 100 times

661
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,080
more we never reach 100 of security

662
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,000
so this means maybe we have to change

663
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
our mindset

664
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
the first point

665
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
go away from the cyber security is all

666
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
to

667
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
to the slogan more or less

668
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,159
that the key is cyber resilience and

669
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,039
cyber security is a part of them

670
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,760
and to fulfill this we need

671
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,000
stable systems we need secure systems

672
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
we need secure operating system we are

673
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
working with operating system we don't

674
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,919
know what they do and we need a lot of

675
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
money to maintain some cure so why we

676
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,159
don't have secure hardware such

677
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,279
operating system made by eu sorry

678
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,799
but this is the best way for us

679
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,799
just coming back

680
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,520
to this question can we close this this

681
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
gap between private sector and the

682
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,320
public sector i think um short answer

683
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,240
again yes we can

684
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
um but probably the only only real way

685
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,360
to do this is

686
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,760
we cooperation

687
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
heard that

688
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
can we for example again as far arm

689
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,880
forces can we attract

690
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,039
enough personnel with the right skill

691
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,400
set

692
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,240
i'm skeptical

693
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
we tend to have a certain hair card

694
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
not so

695
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,799
attractive for a lot of the it geeks

696
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,960
we're talking about

697
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
the pay gap was already mentioned during

698
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
the former panel

699
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,880
all this makes it a little bit

700
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
hard do we stop in trying no of course

701
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,159
not um

702
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,320
we tend to attract a lot of people with

703
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,080
different skill sets we train them very

704
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,200
well and we give them great

705
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,919
opportunities because sometimes

706
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,679
with the armed forces they

707
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,760
may do things

708
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
they couldn't or at least shouldn't do

709
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,600
in the private sector

710
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
and that can be right quite interesting

711
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,039
for one or the other

712
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,840
um

713
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
so

714
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,960
but coming back to the to the real

715
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,679
answer yes we can do it but it's again

716
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,120
we're in this in this new social

717
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,679
contract we have to do it together

718
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,840
it's all about the public in the private

719
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,159
sector working together and please do

720
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,559
not forget we're talking about the

721
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,840
private sector this is not a unity we've

722
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
got very large

723
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,360
critical infrastructure companies they

724
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,679
don't have any problems come competing

725
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,919
with us or the world but we also got

726
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,360
smus which have definitely have much

727
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,880
greater problems

728
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,760
and have the same question how do we

729
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
as a private company close the gap to

730
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,799
these large companies

731
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,520
so this is what i think of as a defend

732
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
today secure tomorrow problem and what

733
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,799
that means is that there are things we

734
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,120
can do today we can automate certain

735
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,919
tasks to take that human element out of

736
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,360
it and push the human source a higher

737
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
order bit and the higher order problem

738
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,080
we can retrain trends or provide

739
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,399
training to transitioning to you know

740
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,440
military

741
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
veterans and things like that

742
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
but but if if we don't fix the

743
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,919
underlying structural problems

744
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,240
we're going to be fighting this battle

745
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
for forever and and some of those

746
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,240
structural problems are frankly in the

747
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,399
education system so i live in the

748
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,440
washington dc area i have five kids

749
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
and i look at the education

750
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,559
that's available to them and from a

751
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,159
computer science

752
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:46,960
and

753
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,640
you know software engineering or coding

754
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,960
perspective it's just not readily

755
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,039
available in the public system or in the

756
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
private school system so how the heck

757
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
are we going to compete compete in the

758
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,399
longer term so we have to invest

759
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,880
in the future or we're going to be

760
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,799
fighting this battle

761
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,799
we're going to be having the same panel

762
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,039
30 years from now

763
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,220
after yeah all right

764
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,320
[Applause]

765
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
i was gonna make a bad joke about covet

766
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,840
32 or something but

767
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
interesting infrastructure problems um

768
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,080
one thing i was going to ask you as well

769
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
is

770
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,000
obviously there's more and more threats

771
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,559
the cost to defend goes up exponentially

772
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,559
and you're never going to get 100 secure

773
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,600
so

774
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
should we look into shifting a focus

775
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,840
from protecting our infrastructure to

776
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,080
just accepting a certain vulnerability

777
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,760
but focusing more on business continuity

778
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
is that a viable model or is that

779
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
nonsense

780
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
if i can jump in on that i think that

781
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,880
was one of the great observations

782
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,559
serving new yorkers when we thought

783
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
about

784
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,320
what they needed and the types of

785
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,159
impacts and consequences that would be

786
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,559
paid by a cyber event we thought as the

787
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,279
whole apparatus working together and i

788
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,799
think to a certain extent bringing a

789
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,200
conversation around resilience and then

790
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
including not just the cyber security

791
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,919
silo but the additional continuity of

792
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,919
operations capabilities of any

793
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,039
organization or organizations together

794
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,760
is the right approach i don't

795
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,640
necessarily accept as an individual that

796
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
all that there will always be a threat

797
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,760
that will be successful i i don't accept

798
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,200
that we cannot

799
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,360
succeed and defend

800
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
with that said i like the expanded

801
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,279
definition of being successful by saying

802
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,360
if for some reason there's a cyber event

803
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,600
i've got a number of different people

804
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,799
along the line with different

805
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,559
authorities and capabilities to help

806
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,000
succeed

807
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,279
so that's why

808
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,520
i like to think about it all right other

809
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,760
views

810
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
yes of course

811
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,039
let's have a look behind the last two

812
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:53,840
years

813
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,799
i think there's a lot we can learn about

814
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,799
what happened there are positive aspects

815
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,760
from eu and official bodies to make

816
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
standards to force security thank you

817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,320
for this also like in ether there are

818
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,640
also a lot of power for this but on the

819
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
other hand we had a lot of negative

820
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
topics they have a massive input of

821
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,279
security and safety for the systems

822
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,760
so i said before we never reach 100 of

823
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,760
security so we need both we need

824
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,360
the operations from the pre-active part

825
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,120
to prevent and

826
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,559
detect

827
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,080
incidents

828
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,159
and we need also the condition business

829
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,919
continuity management if something

830
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,399
happened to to start up our systems

831
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,440
again

832
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
we need both in a balanced way i would

833
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
say

834
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
i would

835
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
really like to pick up wedge of

836
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,399
stopped um

837
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,559
i loved your saying as an individual i

838
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,039
won't accept that there always remains a

839
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,360
certain threat now let's go on and say

840
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,840
even as organizations we shouldn't

841
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,279
accept this

842
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,240
um because it leads to the best effort

843
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
but at the same time we should also

844
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,799
always realize that not accepting

845
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,039
doesn't mean it doesn't happen

846
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,200
and that's what i meant when i when i

847
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,760
tried to define to defend earlier on in

848
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,960
the panel

849
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,799
defense is in the first step about

850
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,120
preventing successful attack

851
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,559
but in a second it's always about

852
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,640
bouncing back

853
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,519
or staying operational on a probably

854
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,039
lower level but

855
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,320
coming very

856
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,039
very quickly back to the level you do

857
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,159
need to operate uh resilience the the

858
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,559
classical term in this discount and i

859
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,720
think that's what we what we really have

860
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
to focus on so again i don't think we

861
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,120
need a change or a shift in strategy we

862
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,679
again have to build up on

863
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,080
perhaps it's also an educational

864
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,399
issue because as a society we have to

865
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,760
understand this there is no one no 100

866
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
security

867
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
and there won't be a 100

868
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,919
security it can't be because there is

869
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,880
nature for example tomorrow i can hit by

870
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
a metroid i'll be dead so i can try to

871
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,279
defend myself against it i probably

872
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,600
will be successful because tomorrow

873
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,240
evening i won't be hit by madrid

874
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,760
but

875
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,880
to be not to coming back to it again i

876
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
think

877
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,600
no shift

878
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,919
but being clear about this and being

879
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,720
more honest to ourselves as an as a

880
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,799
society as individuals and as

881
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,559
organizations and that's really

882
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,080
important because

883
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,240
when we do this we come back to the

884
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,320
questions of prioritization

885
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,760
when we're talking about funds and

886
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
budgets and so on money

887
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
it i i think

888
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,919
building on that the resilience piece i

889
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,559
think also if this is a risk management

890
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,320
problem and if you think about risk

891
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
management risk is the classic

892
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,919
combination of threat vulnerability and

893
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,760
consequence i think we've really

894
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,240
invested heavily in understanding threat

895
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
and mitigating threat we're working on

896
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,840
the vulnerability piece and

897
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,000
understanding where vulnerabilities in

898
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,080
our systems are misconfigurations and

899
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
addressing those i think what we don't

900
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,000
do enough of

901
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,360
is managing the consequence variable

902
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,200
and i i've seen that in the us

903
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
government where all the prioritization

904
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,679
is on the threat piece

905
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,440
and then you move down the gradient

906
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
towards towards uh vulnerability but

907
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,840
consequence is a wide open space

908
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,480
and so if we can focus on that in

909
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,799
understanding into the through the

910
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,720
traditional business continuity planning

911
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,960
perspective and what those you know what

912
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
your recovery time objectives are and

913
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
things like that you start baking that

914
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,440
more and more into it operations

915
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
in the dependencies we have including on

916
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,440
third-party service providers and how

917
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
bad a cloud shock would hit us if aws

918
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,679
azure gcp whatever drops out tomorrow

919
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,240
like those i think that's the

920
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,679
the discipline

921
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,200
where uh

922
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,559
we need more maturity we need more

923
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,159
investment

924
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,600
if i can add on that i think to a

925
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,679
certain extent we need incentive to do

926
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,399
so

927
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
and right now if you look at how

928
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,159
interconnected we all believe we

929
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,000
certainly are digitally

930
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,440
like the incentive is that we realize

931
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
that you know as we observe and

932
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,679
a war

933
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,000
from a digital perspective

934
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
we are connected and that is a very

935
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,679
strong incentive because you know though

936
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,199
some of us are so far away

937
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,800
what happens

938
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,199
proximate to that geography

939
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,199
through digital means is directly

940
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,399
able to impact our critical

941
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,839
infrastructure and our trust mechanisms

942
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,000
like imagining that maxar technologies

943
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,879
got down for example maybe one

944
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
additional point to manage the risk you

945
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,599
said before we need people to have

946
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,719
knowledge about so and i googled on that

947
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,760
trip

948
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,960
to munich um how many

949
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
universities or our schools

950
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,880
offers i.t security so it's not really

951
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
much and then i googled about ot

952
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,760
security for the critical infrastructure

953
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,320
i received a result with zero foundings

954
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
so at this point we need a push for the

955
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,839
digital literacy

956
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,880
let's make a simple experiment

957
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,200
every unpatched device every arpeggio

958
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,280
device can be used as zombie for ddos

959
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,800
attacks to our critical infrastructure

960
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
systems or other systems

961
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
so it's it's not very difficult

962
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,720
who have you

963
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,680
so we have to start at our own self

964
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,480
same as mine who of you have configured

965
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,440
your dsl router in a secure way at home

966
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,680
okay

967
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,720
[Laughter]

968
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,880
and who doesn't what is configured

969
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,760
i mentioned i have five kits right

970
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
yeah yeah that's what i mean so what we

971
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
have to do is to raise up the digital

972
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,280
literacy at the the society starting at

973
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,079
us and and ending at the university

974
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,800
academic line

975
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,720
all right interesting i'd like to switch

976
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,040
subjects a little bit um and touch on

977
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,119
the operational aspects of two emerging

978
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,720
technologies everyone's talking about

979
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,560
blockchain

980
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,320
and quantum computing

981
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,160
how does that affect

982
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,839
cybersecurity

983
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,040
blockchain

984
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,119
is an architecture that by definition is

985
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,160
built trustless

986
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,240
does that make

987
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,640
a cyber security guy's job easier

988
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,119
do uh quantum computers that make it a

989
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,720
lot harder because they can hack

990
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,359
anything or crack any code any views

991
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,480
so just a quick anecdote on blockchain

992
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,520
and cryptocurrencies in particular so

993
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,400
i've

994
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,599
long been banging the drum on ransomware

995
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,119
and i think the last time we were here

996
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
in 19 i talked about the the

997
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
national security threat that was

998
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,599
ransomware

999
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,440
there are three problems with ransomware

1000
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,839
in general first is that

1001
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,839
the install base is still too easy to

1002
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,680
hit you know the vulnerabilities the bad

1003
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,960
guys have just figured out how to

1004
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,640
monetize misconfigurations and

1005
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,720
vulnerabilities the second is that there

1006
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,119
are financial instruments outside of the

1007
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,520
fiat economy regulatory mechanisms in

1008
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
cryptocurrencies and exchange wallets

1009
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,839
and things like suez exchange that allow

1010
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,599
for that transfer outside of law

1011
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,520
enforcement the third is that there was

1012
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,680
a safe haven or harbor in russia that

1013
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,119
would allow this

1014
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,000
ecosystem to thrive

1015
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the problem that we saw at least in the

1016
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,160
united states was we actually don't know

1017
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,320
what the denominator is in ransomware

1018
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
because no one's reporting it to the

1019
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,119
federal government

1020
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,160
there's there's about a 15 to 20

1021
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,119
maybe

1022
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,280
understanding of the types of ransomware

1023
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
attacks really the only person that

1024
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,240
knows how many ransomware attacks there

1025
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,560
are the ransomware actors themselves

1026
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,880
and the the issue here is that if we had

1027
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,680
more timely reporting

1028
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
of ransomware events with key indicators

1029
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,440
including the wallets that you're

1030
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,480
sharing

1031
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,920
the cryptocurrency

1032
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,240
ransomware payments into if you shared

1033
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,359
that with

1034
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,839
a cryptocurrency forensic team and law

1035
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,000
enforcement due to the immutable

1036
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
characteristics of the blockchain

1037
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,240
you could actually probably disrupt

1038
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,960
and recover like they did after

1039
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
colonial

1040
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,280
last year

1041
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,839
so there are incentives but the again

1042
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,680
the legal mechanisms that are in place

1043
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
the fear of reporting so there are

1044
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,160
advantages to the blockchain to cyber

1045
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
the cyber security community we're just

1046
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,119
not realizing them for various lawyers

1047
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,320
reasons very interesting

1048
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,320
i would take quantum computing um

1049
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,520
short version uh course and a blessing

1050
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,599
for the military at least

1051
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,320
it's a course because it makes

1052
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,480
secure communication

1053
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,560
and everything which has to do with

1054
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
encryption

1055
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,280
a lot harder

1056
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,800
a blessing

1057
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,960
because for me as a military not for me

1058
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
as a person it makes cracking the other

1059
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,359
guy's secure communication a lot easier

1060
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,880
so again it's

1061
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,440
about this balance and it's always about

1062
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,920
the situation i'm in at the moment what

1063
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,240
it will give me

1064
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,680
our answer is we are resist researching

1065
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
quantum computing at our federal armed

1066
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,079
forces university here in munich um

1067
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,680
because we

1068
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,480
very early started to think about this

1069
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,800
point and it's something very high up on

1070
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
our again

1071
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,359
so you're saying it makes sense to spend

1072
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,680
time thinking about quantum computing

1073
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
and also blockchains because it is

1074
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,640
relevant

1075
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,400
jeff i was just going to say especially

1076
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,079
on quantum

1077
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,960
it never helps society to back away from

1078
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,880
innovation and if you just think from a

1079
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,640
math perspective of what quantum is it

1080
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,240
allows the computation of exceptionally

1081
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,520
almost unfathomable problems which means

1082
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
if applied correctly we can solve

1083
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,880
exceptional unfathomable problems so by

1084
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
no way should security stand in the way

1085
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,280
of it in fact we should run towards it

1086
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
because we have a lot of problems to

1087
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,040
solve

1088
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
um yesterday i was on a security and

1089
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,680
risk management event in austria and

1090
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,760
there was one of the master people of

1091
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,920
quantum computing in austria also there

1092
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240
and he has a presentation about

1093
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
and he said

1094
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,160
one of the big benefit of our actual

1095
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,839
encryption methods are that the

1096
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,200
decryption

1097
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,680
needs a much more longer time than the

1098
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,119
encryption

1099
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,680
so and he was proud to present that the

1100
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,520
quantum computing

1101
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,240
needs less time for decryption was at

1102
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,680
the same time for decryption as

1103
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
encryption

1104
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,920
so and if i'm asking okay but what does

1105
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
it mean for the security community does

1106
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,520
it mean we lost our benefit of

1107
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,440
encryption because the hacker need the

1108
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,280
same time to decrypt what we encrypt yes

1109
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,400
so and i'm not sure i'm not sure if it

1110
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,319
quantum computing is a benefit for your

1111
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,480
security if we don't have a look about

1112
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,800
how we use them

1113
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,359
to a certain amount would kill my joke

1114
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,680
because of course it's it's true that

1115
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,839
quantum computing will give us a

1116
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,640
special opportunity on new capabilities

1117
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,599
in terms of our own encryption

1118
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,960
but

1119
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,520
i just can't go out in in some shop and

1120
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,280
buy a totally new equipment for the

1121
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,880
whole armed forces so i will always have

1122
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
this transitional phase where the old

1123
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,960
equipment and this will be

1124
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,680
in danger by quantum computing

1125
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,440
as well as in the new equipment which

1126
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
will bring the advantages of quantum

1127
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,800
computing to the table so i try to

1128
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,240
have my jokes surviving

1129
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,200
real quick and maybe you know peter to

1130
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,599
think about next year's agenda an issue

1131
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,440
that i think we're not paying enough

1132
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,280
attention to right now and this is

1133
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
another one of those defend today secure

1134
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,280
tomorrow problems is web 3.0

1135
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,480
decentralized finance smart contracts

1136
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,160
the the risk that that is being uh

1137
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,400
levied out right now is incredibly

1138
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,599
complex

1139
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,359
and it's flying under the eye of

1140
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,640
regulators

1141
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
and i i don't i don't think we have a

1142
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,760
full appreciation of of what is uh

1143
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,200
what's being held on to out there right

1144
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,599
now without i think we've run over time

1145
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,200
i hope it was interesting to all of you

1146
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
great questions thank you give me a big

1147
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
give a big round of applause to this
