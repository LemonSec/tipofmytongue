[Music]

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,480
since we don't have a lot of time and we

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,759
don't want to

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,119
strain your attention even more

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,480
we will get straight to the questions

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,100
my first question would be for mr berg

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,920
[Music]

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
how can we overcome

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,119
flawed market incentives often companies

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,000
have the incentive of

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
having speed

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
and prioritizing it before quality

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,559
which means that they would try to bring

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,719
something out quickly and then patches

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,680
would follow and um so it wouldn't

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,640
really uh be security in the post math

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
rather than in the design

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,480
i think

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
i think i've been told that this is this

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,239
is the fun part now often but i think

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,840
this topic is not a fun topic to be

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,960
honest and therefore it's quite tough to

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
answer but what i see is um

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,959
maybe two or three years ago we saw

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,119
cyber security is nice to have was a

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
nice to have topic and especially me

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,479
talking for the whole industry i have

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
over two or companies in germany

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
representing what we saw the last maybe

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
18 months is a big change in cyber

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
security and awareness even the top

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,159
management is very very familiar with

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
the topic and we had a discussion a

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,119
couple of weeks ago and we asked the

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,119
companies how many companies are really

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
attacked last year and maybe guess it

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,360
was 88 of all companies germans are

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,280
attacked the last 12 months and this is

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,799
not not fun anymore there's really no

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
fun anymore and if you if you see what

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
what happened in this in this industry

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
um it is uh it is

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,360
how much you already asked how much

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,280
money do you spend how much percentage

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,479
of your it spending is invested in id

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
security and then i give you the number

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
it was in germany was roughly seven

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,880
percent and we encourage everyone to

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
spend between 15 and 20 i think this is

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
the number we at bitcom and bdi we say

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,079
this you should invest you see larger

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
companies invest more percentage-wise

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
than smaller companies but it gets it's

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
so many people are attacked that means

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
therefore it's not fun anymore it is a

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
real topic is a very important topic and

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
we heard it all the day or during the

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
day that is super important and then

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
what you see as well is maybe two more

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
three two three more topics you see this

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,239
um security by design approach that you

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,400
see that that it's it's it gets in

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
hardware and software it's included and

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
we see it's it's much more important and

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
uh many more questions that the other

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
topic is is the ease of use of software

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
and um what we all know if if it isn't

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
it's not ease of use your your your

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
people don't use it anymore don't use it

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
the right way they find other solutions

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
they use whatsapp for other stuff and

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
this is something we see as well it has

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
to be ease of use and maybe what we had

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
the last topic and was this cut and

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,280
maybe two to um two rounds before there

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,840
was a discussion about zero trust

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,239
and um i'm really impressed by the us

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,920
government but they said okay zero trust

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,879
by end of

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,760
2024 was what i've heard that was 2024.

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,159
this is a big step and this is a big

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,239
achievement because not only the

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
external firewall and internal firewall

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
as well because what we saw as well is

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
that over the half of all attacks coming

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
from internals not from externals and

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
this is maybe how i see this and there's

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,760
a big change in mind of the mind it's a

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,599
big change in the the whole the whole

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,920
management teams and this is very very

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
good involvement that's more or less

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
what i'm seeing

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,480
thank you so much

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,440
for those um words which already uh are

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
really important like zero trust but

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
also um internal insider threats which

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
need to be addressed

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
throughout companies

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
um if we

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
continue about

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,959
the the market flaws um and that idea

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
is there also market flow perhaps coming

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,080
from um

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,519
users which want rather usability than

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,519
security um and on that point i would

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
like to ask um to share so

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
so let me clarify first something about

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
the cyber innovation app because i'm

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,680
pretty sure you will requesting me after

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
this show here about cyber security

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
products we deal with every digital

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,680
problem of our soldiers cyber is just a

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,920
minimal part of that first of all so

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
regarding users

116
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
and we're talking directly to soldiers

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
and about their problem that they have

118
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,798
on the battlefield and so on and to be

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,639
very honest to you guys cyber is not the

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,120
main problem at all yeah so they have

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
really problems on the battlefield

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
analyzing data or getting clarification

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
about the opponent

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
as well so

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
it's about

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
values and functionalities

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
basically cyber security it's not a

128
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
really

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
big issue

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
for sure secure by design is always part

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,120
of it but it's not the main drive of

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,240
innovation

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
so i think that's the big problem and

134
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,919
second we should not blame the user to

135
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
be very honest so i'm from berlin i'm

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,199
now in munich

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,080
and

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,720
i'm a single guy so i would download a

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
dating app basically and not asking

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
about cyber and data privacy at all i'm

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,800
talking about and thinking about

142
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,639
functionalities so and that's a big

143
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,680
difference in in the mindsets so and i

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
can call you all cybersecurity guys

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
please try to understand the user

146
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
he's in the driver's seat it's not you

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
and i think this is a very cultural

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
issue as well in the cyber security

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
community i'm since 20 years in a cyber

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
security company and then a cyber

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
security environment and then i left

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
because i think they're much broader

153
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,840
topics

154
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
for the end users

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,800
than cyber security

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
yes security needs to be as

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
easy and seamless as possible

158
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,199
i think

159
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,360
there was the whole thing about how

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
secure passwords are being managed and

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
with special characters and in the end

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
um

163
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
the the conclusion came that uh it's

164
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
better to have just long words which are

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
easily memorable rather than have

166
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,199
complicated passwords that nobody can

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
remember or it's even better to use than

168
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
on password managers

169
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,000
but

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,479
since we've managed already

171
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,360
we've already mentioned

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
usability we have mentioned zero trust

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
already a couple of times today

174
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
and also that google was one of the

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
first companies to pioneer this approach

176
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,479
so now as we have uh jochen on this

177
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
panel perhaps he can

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
share how

179
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
that road started and how

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
that road

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
how you're implementing it currently

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
and to broaden the question

183
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
um i would ask also

184
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,400
what

185
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,720
are the latest achievements in

186
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
security by design

187
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,240
in the hardware and in the software

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
industries

189
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
and where do you see

190
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
more need for research and development

191
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,120
um yeah thank you um

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
so indeed i would consider zero trust as

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,840
one of the biggest achievements in in

194
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,319
security in in the past few years

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
um looking back more than 10 years ago

196
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
google was suffering an attack from a

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
nation-state

198
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
backed attacker

199
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,080
and

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,400
at that point instead of

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
just fixing the vulnerabilities that

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
were used by the attacker we took an

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
approach and took a step back

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
and redesigned our system to do what we

205
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
now call zero trust so the idea is that

206
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,479
instead of relying on on a firewall on a

207
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,400
parameter to decide who you trust and

208
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
who you don't trust

209
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,479
you trust nobody but everybody who wants

210
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
access to your systems

211
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
has to authenticate themselves and they

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
have to authenticate the hardware

213
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
they're using to communicate with the

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
system

215
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
and fast forwarding to today right like

216
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,840
where during the pandemic we were first

217
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,440
all to quickly move to working from home

218
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
this is a setup now that works for on

219
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,039
all googlers right like where we have

220
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,800
machines at home we're not relying on a

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
vpn but we can directly

222
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
continue to work

223
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,800
in the zero trust environment and so i'm

224
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
also i'm really proud that we are now

225
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
rolling out this technology to more and

226
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
more users it's part of the google

227
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,280
workspace and cloud offering

228
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,160
um

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
where

230
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,039
you you can support scenarios like bring

231
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
your own device without having to rely

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,960
um on on vpn or having to trust each and

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
every endpoint

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,199
but i think zero trust is also more than

235
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,280
that right so you can also look at

236
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,840
setups where you have different

237
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,440
microservices even in different clouds

238
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,199
i'm talking to each other where you want

239
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,479
to have this kind of zero trust or

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,719
looking at the web browser chrome which

241
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,479
i'm working on

242
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,559
we're also employing a zero trust system

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
stair where we sandboxing untrusted

244
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
content from the web away from

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
the privileged browser process to secure

246
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
the user right so i i think zero trust

247
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,920
is really

248
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
it's a keyword that encompasses a lot of

249
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
security innovation

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
are there any tradeoffs in implementing

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
zero trust

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,440
or security by design more broadly

253
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
or is that a hurdle that's kind of

254
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
slowing down things

255
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
so i mean as i said well like it was

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
something that we started more than 10

257
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
years ago so um certainly that was a

258
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
long stretch

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and so i wouldn't say it it's easy

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
however

261
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,839
if you nowadays um start from from

262
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,920
scratch like you you start with um

263
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
security by design i think um

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,760
incorporating zero trust is actually not

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
much of a hurdle right and then for me

266
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
as an end user it's actually easier

267
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,959
right like i don't have to

268
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,160
install a vpn um my system administrator

269
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
doesn't have to worry about me using um

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
maybe an outdated operating system or

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
something but this is all automatically

272
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
checked right so part of the zero trust

273
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
assumption is that my machine also has

274
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
to prove that it's running up-to-date

275
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
software that i have a screen lock

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,200
configured and so on so um i believe

277
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
that actually

278
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,839
good security really should be invisible

279
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,040
right as

280
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
as you said

281
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
the user in in the case of myself i want

282
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
to work right like i don't want to deal

283
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,760
with a complicated login sessions and so

284
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
really good security should not get in

285
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,000
my way but it should support me in what

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,560
i'm trying to achieve

287
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
thank you

288
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,600
now we've talked about technology

289
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
let's move to talk about the human

290
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,839
element

291
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,320
and mr schneider

292
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
we would talk

293
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,279
also about the

294
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,040
organizational culture and if you

295
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,600
have to oversee large organizations

296
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
what is the role of employees in an

297
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
organization's cyber security

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,720
and how do you establish good

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
organizational culture and a sufficient

300
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,560
level

301
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
of cyber hygiene

302
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
and then in large-scale organizations

303
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,079
that

304
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
you work for

305
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
first of all uh i would say

306
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,640
the employees is the crucial role

307
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
at all allianz they are working 150 000

308
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,040
uh employees 150 000

309
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
but before i answer the question with

310
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
cyber security and

311
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,560
employees in cyber hygiene i would say

312
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,040
what is the real problem because we

313
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
sometimes i i have the feeling we are

314
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
not discussing the real problem the real

315
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,000
problem is not that we invented the

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,279
cyberspace yeah we invented it and when

317
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,959
you are in the cyberspace it's no

318
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
problem but

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
we connected the cyberspace with the

320
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
analog world and when something is going

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
wrong in the cyberspace it has effects

322
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
that something goes wrong in the analog

323
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,639
world because we connected both yeah and

324
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
this is uh for me the real problem and

325
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,320
therefore i buy in a a little bit in

326
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,120
this the direction cyber security is

327
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
crucial yeah it's really crucial because

328
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
you cannot allow because i only

329
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
discussing now business when an

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
application a business application

331
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,279
crashes each and every business guy is

332
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
saying oh what is my reputational risk

333
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
my operational risk my financial risk my

334
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
legal risk when this is crashing so it's

335
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
very important for the business when an

336
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,560
application is crashing yeah doesn't

337
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
matter which root cause

338
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,839
so how we connect now the analog world

339
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,240
with the digital world be connected via

340
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
employees

341
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
by people

342
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
nothing else

343
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,079
we connected via people and therefore

344
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
each and everybody has to get then an

345
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
employee an identity

346
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,279
and access rights so everybody knows

347
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
here in the room

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
identity access management is number one

349
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
when you are starting a cyber

350
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
cyber security

351
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,639
but

352
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,440
now

353
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,519
cultural change and we need these

354
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
cultural changes i have not only exits

355
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,399
rights

356
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,680
but i have also access responsibilities

357
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
when i go in

358
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
of course this system admin has much

359
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,880
more responsibility here's not only

360
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
rights but responsibilities and this is

361
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,360
for me the crucial point how we we make

362
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
it happen that it's not only access

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,279
rights and access

364
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,120
responsibilities and then okay we have

365
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
to make it with technology as communi

366
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
convenient as possible and my dream

367
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
would be when the employees are saying

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,760
i will not go in the cyber space without

369
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,800
multi-factor identification i want to

370
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,240
have it and

371
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,199
you have to bring it from the technology

372
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,160
and when the 150 000 would say i will

373
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
not go uh in the systems

374
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
i promise you we would have

375
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,399
huge huge uh investments to do to solve

376
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,959
this problem for the whole company

377
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
you said i'm surprised you said if the

378
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
machine crashes your biggest problem i

379
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,720
think there i guess a few there are a

380
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,079
few companies or a few people will be

381
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
very interested in your data as well

382
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,519
don't you think so

383
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,720
of course i personally am very

384
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
interested to be honest yeah of course

385
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
but then uh also then the

386
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
application is crashes when you are it's

387
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,839
not a crash i just said yeah you steal

388
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
it yeah of course yeah of course

389
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
i think this is isn't this the most

390
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
important thing the most critical issue

391
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,120
if allianz gets maybe losing all the

392
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
data including financial data including

393
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,360
accounts everything of course when

394
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,839
when our active directory is crashing we

395
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,399
have a huge because no application is

396
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,360
running anymore when our data is stolen

397
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
no application can do a job and we have

398
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,720
a huge reputational

399
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
risk and

400
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
for a lot of applications

401
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
huge

402
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,440
so therefore no doubt zero trust and

403
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,760
also not only the tech companies going

404
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,399
in this direction yes we have to check

405
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
each and every access to the data

406
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
whether it's uh it's an uh legacy

407
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,160
access or not therefore these uh

408
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,120
thinking that you cannot trust

409
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
the perimeter is also coming more and

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,199
more in

411
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,079
in the

412
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
not only in the tech company but the

413
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
normal business i would say

414
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,759
you mentioned

415
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,160
not only access privilege but also

416
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
access responsibility and the people in

417
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
the company who have the largest

418
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,440
responsibility are ceos yeah and a

419
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
little bit

420
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,839
for for the fun factor you said okay a

421
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,320
very critical uh point is in cyber

422
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,279
hygiene of course emails yeah we invest

423
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,399
a lot that no mail were coming by email

424
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,639
but you never know and they found the

425
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
hacker found a ways therefore we are

426
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,000
doing training

427
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,959
and phishing campaigns and this pays off

428
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,839
yeah when you are regularly training all

429
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
the 150 000 people you see sooner or

430
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
later it

431
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
it's getting better and better so the

432
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,519
responsible on the i.t side is that you

433
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,079
are really train your people and give

434
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,880
their them convenient solution that they

435
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,079
can do

436
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,959
secure business

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,079
if we

438
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,120
something that i would um also like to

439
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
address

440
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
here is the

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
uh as we've mentioned already

442
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,279
earlier um the ukraine crisis um let's

443
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,440
touch on it perhaps as well

444
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
and uh

445
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
one of the large organization

446
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
organization which has been impacted

447
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
more considerably has also been the

448
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,839
armed forces

449
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
so

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
could you perhaps

451
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,199
elaborate a bit on how

452
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
the ukraine crisis has

453
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,240
changed your work and the priorities in

454
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,039
your organization so as already

455
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,199
mentioned my work

456
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,959
is the same basically

457
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,880
because you have to understand when you

458
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,119
work for or when you lead an innovation

459
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
unit

460
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,880
a sense of urgency is

461
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,199
always a part of your dna

462
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,919
my guys are very paranoid

463
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,120
because we don't know what's going to

464
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
happen tomorrow

465
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
there's no cozy time

466
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,120
in the in the hub to be very honest

467
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,880
sounds really strange right so but um

468
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
we have china we have russia and so on

469
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,799
right so we have to innovate

470
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,200
for the country for germany for europe

471
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
this is what drives us basically

472
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
and um

473
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,919
i think this needs to be part of dna

474
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
of many citizens in germany to be very

475
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,480
honest because i think one of the main

476
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
problems innovation is

477
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,320
if you fail someone blames you this is

478
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
very german

479
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,200
but if you don't try you will not

480
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,799
succeed at all so fail fast fail cheap

481
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,880
and i would call that an innovation

482
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
culture learning culture

483
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
and if you look on

484
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
a venture capital

485
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,720
it's a completely different meaning in

486
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
the u.s and germany

487
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,880
it's a germany called gizuku capital

488
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
it sounds already dangerous

489
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
yeah in the u.s it's venture it's more

490
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,960
adventurous

491
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
so it's a mindset topic and you can

492
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
throw as much as much money as you like

493
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,799
into the system

494
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,760
you cannot buy culture with money

495
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,520
and culture is the game changer

496
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,720
because

497
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
having not the right culture is the

498
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,720
gatekeeper for everything and i think

499
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,679
some guy

500
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,799
also mentioned

501
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
we have all the solutions in place

502
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
they're available basically

503
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,799
but we can't purchase them somehow

504
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,540
i'm not looking to copelands yeah but um

505
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,160
[Music]

506
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,360
thank you

507
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
so much

508
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
i like to add what we what uh the

509
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
ukraine conflict for me

510
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,840
or for our organization what we learned

511
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,480
you can now do some things you never

512
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,120
have can done before

513
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,559
for example in our edr tool we can do

514
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,760
now an automatic rollout yeah not

515
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
testing everything before and each and

516
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,039
every uh operating entity we roll it out

517
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,480
globally

518
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,039
and nobody is discussing this anymore

519
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
that this is possible or not or another

520
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
example

521
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,520
i always said we have to monitor all our

522
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
different active directory in real time

523
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,840
yeah and now

524
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
also the admins are accepting now we

525
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,960
monitor it now in real time each and

526
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
every active directory so you see you

527
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,799
can now do

528
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
things we dreamed

529
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
since years in cyber security

530
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
but will it will it persist do you think

531
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
or is it will it persist will it go on

532
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,480
or is it just like an immediate reaction

533
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,320
which will then again

534
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
turn into

535
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
less diligence and negligence and

536
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,440
yeah

537
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
because in the mindsets they

538
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,360
it is now a change in the mindset how

539
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
vulnerable we we are and nobody thought

540
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,559
about uh before ukraine how fast

541
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,640
everything can be changed yeah and the

542
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,039
business is stopping yeah and we have

543
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,520
operations in ukraine we have operations

544
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
or we had the operations in in russia

545
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
and uh

546
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,640
therefore you see immediately how fast

547
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,120
uh the thinking changed also in the

548
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,919
business it's very important it's not

549
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
any more an i.t stuff

550
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,559
because now they are discussing more and

551
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,520
more secure business and now you are an

552
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,240
a enabler for the business and you are

553
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
not a security tax anymore

554
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
i think what i have but

555
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
maybe some you can give me some evidence

556
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,280
but i've heard from a few companies was

557
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,280
since the 24th of february the attacks

558
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
grow their tax growth was by five to ten

559
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
percent fifty two hundred percent it

560
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,799
went from three thousand to thirty

561
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,799
thousand texts per day and one company

562
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,640
are asked maybe is it the same for you

563
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
is the same with the allianz you see an

564
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,840
increase of a

565
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
and the last couple of them

566
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,480
decrease a decrease decrease

567
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,679
decrease

568
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,880
interesting

569
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
how do you explain that

570
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
sorry

571
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
how do you explain the decrease is it

572
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
i guess there is

573
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,640
the energy is going in another direction

574
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,919
uh and uh and the normal um and the

575
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
normal normal attacks you can manage

576
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,919
easily yeah and therefore we see that so

577
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,640
to speak the normal attacks uh i would

578
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
say which you can block very easily

579
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
going down yeah

580
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,880
apologies we have a bit veered off from

581
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
the topic so we'll go back now

582
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,400
to security by design which uh another

583
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,679
big topic

584
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,679
is open source software

585
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,679
uh the secure the security and the

586
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,360
design but also in the maintenance of

587
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,159
open source software because often um as

588
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,159
with the log4j

589
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
vulnerability

590
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,080
uh there it just hasn't been maintained

591
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,799
any anymore or just like a few people

592
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,960
who have been doing it and now

593
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,880
uh as a pet project and so i'd like to

594
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,919
ask

595
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,120
jochen as well as google is also a

596
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,720
pioneer in open source software

597
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
how can we

598
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
make that better is there

599
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,600
perhaps what we haven't mentioned today

600
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,760
is also the role of the state

601
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
can the state do something better to

602
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
um

603
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,159
provide us with more security by design

604
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,400
in open source software

605
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,760
um yeah

606
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
it's actually as an open source

607
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,799
developer myself

608
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,799
it's very important to me to make sure

609
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,720
that we're not putting the blame on an

610
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,159
individual open source project right

611
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,840
like many of those projects are actually

612
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
as you said right they're run by people

613
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,280
in their free time

614
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
and so

615
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
it is us

616
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,679
who choose to use that software and

617
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,919
build industry scale software with that

618
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,039
that

619
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,200
we promise to meet certain security

620
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
standards and so we can't expect those

621
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,600
people that are contributing to open

622
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
source software

623
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,039
to just on their own meet the same

624
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,760
security standards but it's on us

625
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,240
both as companies using open software

626
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,159
software but also states using open

627
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,400
source software to ensure that

628
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,760
open source software has adequate

629
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,880
tooling

630
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
to achieve security they have adequate

631
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
funding to achieve security

632
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
right and um

633
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,880
we're living in a very interconnected

634
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
world time

635
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,559
to right yeah

636
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,720
funding is like both resources but also

637
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
the time right um

638
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
and

639
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,760
i mean you you mentioned cyber right now

640
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,880
you can you can train your own staff

641
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,760
but

642
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
um cyber really means that we're living

643
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,600
in a very interconnected world right and

644
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,559
so you you can train your own staff but

645
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
there are many components so called

646
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,880
supply chain uh security matters here

647
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,000
right and so i think it's up on both the

648
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,039
public and the private sector to

649
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,320
actually increase

650
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,960
funding for open source initiatives

651
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
right i think we have for example here

652
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
in the european union um

653
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,679
a lot of leading regulation in

654
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,840
cyber security but also resilience but

655
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
we don't have an adequate level of

656
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
funding for open source security yet and

657
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,799
i i think that's something where we can

658
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
really improve

659
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,159
perhaps also on the european level right

660
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,240
to think at the bigger scale not just in

661
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
individual countries um and then also um

662
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
even further perhaps in transatlantic

663
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,640
countries

664
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
again i think it's not like you you

665
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
wouldn't invest in open source

666
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,279
out of an altruistic

667
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
um instinct but really it is part of

668
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,440
your supply chain it is part of your

669
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,919
security threat model and

670
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,600
i think only with that mindset um we can

671
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,480
start funding open source to the point

672
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,799
on to to which we already now rely on

673
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
open source for security

674
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,159
then did you still want to add something

675
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,559
earlier no

676
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
good

677
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,080
but yes i would say this is a great idea

678
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
because we discussed uh so much

679
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,799
so many times today that we have to

680
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,240
collaborate

681
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,120
and open source security would be an

682
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,640
ideal way that we collaborate each and

683
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
everybody cross border cross across

684
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
countries across business uh to do in

685
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
invest

686
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,880
uh time and and money

687
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
to uh to build open source security this

688
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,400
would be

689
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,799
uh yeah then it's not a business model

690
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,760
but we can oh everybody can join this

691
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
community i would say a great a great

692
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
idea but i mean you mentioned earlier

693
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
right like if your servers are crashing

694
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,240
it is a business problem right and so

695
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,279
assuming

696
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,080
that at least some of the software has

697
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,240
somewhere open source in its supply

698
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
chain it is already a business case for

699
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
you to improve security there

700
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,559
at this point we would like to conclude

701
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,799
