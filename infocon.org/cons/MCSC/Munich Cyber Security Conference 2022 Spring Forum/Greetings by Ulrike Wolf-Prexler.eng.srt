convey the best regards of state

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
minister ivanka

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
he very much regrets not being able to

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
be here in person today

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
and of course of vice minister roland

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
weigert who fell ill just this afternoon

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,200
and he asked me to jump in

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
cyber security is the subject of the day

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,479
as we all know because the war in

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,479
ukraine compels action in cyber security

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
this statement was pronounced by the

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,560
german chamber of industry and commerce

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
in addition to the unspeakable suffering

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
and destruction in ukraine caused by the

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,560
russian war of aggression there is

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,439
another war playing out in the virtual

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
space

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
this is because

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
the war in ukraine is increasingly

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,719
accompanied by hacker attacks

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,399
the most unknown

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
perpetrators are primarily targeting

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
critical infrastructure

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,520
as well as digital network and service

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
providers

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,720
so

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
for people as you who have

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
been

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
working on cyber security

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,760
a long time already

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
the uh

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,160
it is not so much of a step but for the

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
rest

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,280
of us they see how important cyber

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
security

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,280
is becoming and it has always been so it

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
is a crucial issue for every person

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
every company

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,519
every entity today

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
so the spring

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
forum of the munich cyber security

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720

74
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,040
