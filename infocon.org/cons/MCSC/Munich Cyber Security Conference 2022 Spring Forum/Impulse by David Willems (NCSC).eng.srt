3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,599
well ladies and gentlemen honored guests

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,640
it's an honor to speak for you today as

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
already mentioned my name is david

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
williams i'm head of the fusion center

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
of the national cyber security center of

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
the netherlands and i've been in ict and

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,279
cyber security for over 20 years now and

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,960
i've seen how it developed from an

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,359
information security topic to a topic

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,558
that has

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
become more political

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,399
and is more present in geopolitical

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,079
conflicts and in critical infrastructure

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,000
than ever

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and i'm also excited but also curious

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
how this will develop over time

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
i've also seen the respective decrease

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
of the typical image of techies and

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
hackers in hoodies which is now slowly

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,559
being replaced by the increase of ties

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,960
and suits as we can see here

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
cyber security is increasingly becoming

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
a important topic on any management

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
board

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,240
and i would like to address today my

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
what i would like to address today such

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
a topic a topic that needs to make its

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
way up to the management board because

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
it's regarded as ordinary day-to-day

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,439
business

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,680
today i would like to talk to you about

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,479
incident response and a better need the

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,360
need for better operational cooperation

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
of crisis

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,479
my key point

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,320
is that we have to increase frameworks

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
and standards standardized rules of

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
cooperation in order to

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
collaborately smoothly across borders

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
during serious cyber incidents

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,759
and yes there are frameworks in place

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,479
but these need to work better together i

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
will get to that in a second

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,159
there's a second point as well the

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,880
crisis mode is also taking our toll on

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
our staff and we need to look into

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
creative ways that we can reduce that

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
impact

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,159
and we are there or are faced with an

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
important dilemma let me let me take you

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
through a

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,000
situation last year to illustrate this

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
on an annual basis in the netherlands we

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,878
have about 700 incidents at the cyber

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
security center and most of these

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
incidents have no serious implications

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
and can be quickly diffused but some do

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,319
have bigger impact

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,959
on the 12th of december 2021 was such an

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,760
example um there was a log for j

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
vulnerability probably a lot of you know

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
about this the look for jay

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
vulnerability if unpatched exists in the

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,440
logic log4j a library for logging errors

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,160
events in java based applications and

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,720
it's a third-party logging solution to

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
lock data inside an application without

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
without having to fabricate a solution

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
specifically for that app

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,519
put simply

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,519
the log4j vulnerability allows hackers

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,280
to steal confidential information or

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
take advantages of available resources

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
well what we did we immediately

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
identified the needs of a single source

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
of truth

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
this log for j component is used in a

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
lot of applications but no one had the

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
complete picture so what we did as he as

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
the nc and csc

83
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,120
we set up a github repository to create

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
a single source of truth which tells us

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,720
in which applications this component is

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,760
used

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
and the point i already mentioned

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
through normal communications channels

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
it would be really difficult to create

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
this collective picture about this

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
this vulnerability what the github was

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
initiated

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,640
initially meant actually to provide

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
information for our dutch constituencies

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
in the critical infrastructure

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
however after we informed our

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
international partners the repo was

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,360
really pushed internationally as well

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
making it well the most complete list

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
out of there so a lot of collaboration

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
started across borders and countries and

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
private industry was also contributing

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,480
to that

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
big picture besides taking quick action

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
to create the github repo

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
we were also quick to inform our intern

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
international

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,920
partners which resulted in a bigger

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,599
traction and contributions from both

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
international partners and vendors

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
who eventually started updating us

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
but setting up a repo is one but

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,600
maintaining a repo is two

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
so initially we had a repo and we were

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
well we were

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
running this and having our staff

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
updating all the information

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
and we had two people staffed on on

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,919
these updates

120
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,639
but it became a big problem because

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,880
it required a lot of resources to keep

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
that database up to date

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
however more importantly due to a big

124
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,919
community effort maintaining the page

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
and processing requests became

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,199
doable when certainly you and said boone

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,800
offered their help and started helping

128
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
us to update that database

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
without these extra human resources

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,759
processing all the pull requests

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,520
would not have been would not have been

132
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,080
doable for us as ncsc netherlands

133
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
[Music]

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
so we needed to allocate additional

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,120
capacity and through search research uh

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
collaboration

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
and the aim was to do

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,840
to to to avoid the duplication of

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
efforts because if we make a repo and

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
someone else makes a repo it's more

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,960
efficient to make one together

142
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
and so we created that central page and

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,400
we started

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
collaborating on that

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
so various incidents in the past among

146
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,639
which log4j

147
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,560
show us that collaboration be public

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
between public and private entities is

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,639
absolutely crucial

150
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
we need to investigate how and what

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
responsibility the private sector

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,039
will have in the future incidents the

153
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
contribution of private companies to the

154
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
github repo resulted in the list of

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,039
vulnerable products being more complete

156
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
which resulted in others being able to

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
patch the vulnerability fast

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
and many times during the lock4j

159
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
incident private partners have

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
information that public entities do not

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,759
have

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
you have different information working

163
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,520
together and sharing as much threat

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
information as possible can help to

165
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
decrease and prevent an impact on

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
national security and support

167
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,000
centralized information flows

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
something that ncc found is extremely

169
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,199
important during crisis

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
in order to decrease the workload

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
we as a community need to start

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
approaching crisis not not only as a

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,240
national crisis but primarily as an

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
international crisis avoid silos work

175
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
together and create one situational

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
picture

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,400
the github approach we believe was a

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,039
good step in that process

179
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
next to that we have various frameworks

180
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
such as c cert network in europe or

181
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
international international watching

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
warning network but need to be deepened

183
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,440
we need to deepen these networks to

184
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,360
create and establish best practices

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
think about putting one country's

186
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
national c cert in the lead of

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,479
communicating with a particular software

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,400
vendor instead of all calling the same

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
for ringing the same software vendor

190
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
which creates an overload of the private

191
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,160
private industry

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
so within nc cnl in its crisis structure

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,400
we have included a role of an

194
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
international advisor

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
we did that

196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
last year and they monitor what happens

197
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,479
in all other countries what other

198
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,919
counterparts are seeing what they are

199
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,400
doing and that this way we prevent that

200
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
we reinvent the wheel and we think that

201
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
we can work together more easily so we

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
believe it also could be a good practice

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
for others to actually

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
look what others are doing on a very

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,840
proactive way

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
sorry

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
that's what i said is relevant for the

208
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
people in the crisis but what about the

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
boardroom was also mentioned today

210
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,160
as i said lock4j started in december and

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,479
since then up to today the ncsc the

212
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,000
netherlands has been in what we call

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,639
escalation mode

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,160
we have been

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
in more escalation mode for more days

216
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
than we have not been in escalation mode

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
meaning that we have been out for two

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,759
weeks or 14 days without an incident and

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,919
after those two weeks the war in ukraine

220
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,280
started

221
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,479
so we are

222
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
continuously

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
putting a burden on our staff

224
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
and we need to cooperate and make to do

225
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
this more efficiently

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
as we all know the impact on escalation

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
mode has staff on staff is huge

228
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
staff

229
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,679
across amongst entire organizations are

230
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,679
forced with additional tasks

231
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
that are designed to only have a very

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
short duration in 2022 we have been in

233
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
escalation mode more days than a normal

234
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,519
mode

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,360
and this means extra work pressure and

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
this also means

237
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,720
less options to go on holidays

238
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
so it's becoming the new normal and we

239
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,320
need to figure out how we're going to

240
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,839
solve this problem

241
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,560
this

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
of course results in firm decisions that

243
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
we need to be taken by the management

244
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
goals need to be reset or shifted and

245
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,120
time needs to be sent differently

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
it also lets us think about whether the

247
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
way we are structured as an organization

248
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
and if it's still future proof do we

249
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
need to do that in a different way

250
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,120
so if i get back to what i was telling

251
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
i started this speech with a key point

252
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
we have to increase frameworks and

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,399
standardize

254
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
rules of cooperation in order to

255
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
collaborate smoothly with international

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
partners during incidents

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and a lot for jks it was a good example

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
how this can work

259
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
and we'll use this as a as a good as

260
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
best as worst cases both

261
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
for the future

262
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,839
the second key point i mentioned is that

263
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,519
crisis mode is having an impact on our

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
staff capacity

265
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
we have to rethink the way we are

266
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
structured as an organization to be able

267
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
to keep responding to increasing cyber

268
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
incidents

269
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
i would like i very much like to

270
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
continue this discussion on how we can

271
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
strengthen international crisis

272
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
cooperation we have the frameworks as

273
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
already mentioned but we need to work

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,360
together towards better crisis

275
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
mechanisms

276
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
one where we don't work in silos but one

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,560
week work collectively across borders

278
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
also with private industry in such a way

279
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
that it reduces the pressure on our

280
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
staff members at all adult organizations

281
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
i hope this could be a good start thank

282
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,900
you very much

283
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,370
