00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,240
ladies and gentlemen

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
let me welcome you to the munich cyber

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
security conference and welcome you all

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
not through the lens of a camera but in

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,199
person

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,880
it's pretty cool to see you here in

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,320
front sitting

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,080
shoulder by shoulder i was a bit shocked

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,760
when i saw the chair so close to each

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,119
other

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,679
but it's very nice to see you all here

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,120
it is

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
about two months back that we had the

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
eighth digital

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
edition of the munich cyber security

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
conference

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,160
just before the munich security

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
conference which took place from the

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
18th to the 20th of february

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,640
a few days later

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,079
we had a

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
change in time the russia ukraine war

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
started it was all quite a busy sequence

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
the munich security conference took

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,440
place in this hall

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,280
and the stage was just on the opposite

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000
side and there was a very

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
intense debate on what happens

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
in russia and there was a lot of

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
negotiation still going on all the state

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
presidents debated on stage and made

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
their points

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
it didn't help so we are in a different

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,479
time

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,720
but before i spend the context to this

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
conference let me welcome a couple of

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
special guests here i would like to

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,439
welcome the former president of estonia

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
mr elvis and his wife thank you for

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,799
joining us here

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
in these turbulent times

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
and my dear friend starts minister

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,119
de justice in bayern

georg eisenheisen

47
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,969
[Applause]

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
i think that this conference comes as

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
always in a good time right i think we

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
are not out of covet 19 we have a lot of

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
tension in the world

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
um but i think the subject matter we are

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,920
having here for the last eight years

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
there was only

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,360
one vector it was always increasing in

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,479
importance

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
and i think with the new realities it

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,200
becomes probably more pressing that we

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,879
have to do something

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
and that's also how we have designed the

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
agenda for today so that you also have

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,160
some takeaway values for yourself we

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,319
start at a fairly high level

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,879
with how geopolitics possibly shape

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,080
or reshape cyber security and i think

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
the context of what we see

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,720
and in the context that the technology

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
race from my viewpoint on will be even

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
further fueled by the tensions in the

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
world just take the spend

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
of north america and particular united

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,040
states europe and china they capture

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
approximately 75

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
of all the volume of technology and

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
innovation money in the world

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
and it's growing year by year

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
and with that growth of technology of

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,760
course the digital infrastructure even

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,480
further involves so we have to make sure

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
that the infrastructure holds and is

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,480
robust

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
and that actually covers the second

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
theme you want to have today from

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,159
geopolitics to how do we actually

85
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,000
protect and ensure that critical

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,159
infrastructures can work in this

87
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,280
environment

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,360
because critical infrastructures are

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
there to protect people

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
and safeguard life and livelihoods as

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,680
well if they are impacted nothing will

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,720
work

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,519
so from geopolitics to

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,560
keeping ditch infrastructures alive and

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
working of course we have to ask

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,799
ourselves how we build trust and

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
resilience in the cyber world

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
and then to be even more bit specific is

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
what do we do to build in security right

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
from the beginning in technology and

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
that sequence goes from fairly high

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
level to a fairly operational level

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,959
and that's the levels we have to cover

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,959
when we think about protecting the

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,280
digital infrastructures we are having

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
and bringing them up

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
i think for all of us here in particular

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
in europe and in america it's not a

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
question of money we have the money but

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
we must make something out of the funds

111
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
we have in order to improve the

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
technology make it more robust and bring

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,238
it forward

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,479
and with these words i leave it as a

115
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,080
beginning but that's the span of the

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
conference today

117
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,479
and i will hand over to the moderator of

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,210
today
