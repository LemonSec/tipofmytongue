00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
dear mr wintergeist ladies and gentlemen

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,480
thank you

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
for the opportunity to participate

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
in today's event

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
cyber security has long been an

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,240
important issue

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,720
now it has a new dimension

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
there's a war in the heart of europe

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
putin's war russia's war

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,880
on ukraine is a fundamental breach of

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
international law breach of the european

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
freedom and peace order

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
this war is not only a military conflict

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,719
it is also a struggle of systems

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
a dictatorship on the one side versus

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
liberal democracies at the other sides

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,680
it's

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,000
also a propaganda war it's more and more

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
trade war

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
and it is in parts a cyber war

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
cyber security has

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,799
several dimensions it concerns nations

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,479
eu nato

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,880
it concerns the economy

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,560
and every single company it concerns our

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,600
societies and every single one of us

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,799
at the level of nations eu and nato

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,119
we are talking about national integrity

31
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,280
and national security

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
in particular about espionage

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
sabotage on destabilization

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,960
destabilization

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
germany has held the g7 presidency

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,759
presidency since the beginning of this

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,799
year

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
alongside climate change and coronavirus

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,399
cyber security is on top of the agenda

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,280
that's

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
sensible and

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,759
necessary

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,719
the danger of cyber attacks is greater

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,360
than ever before

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
russia's cyber army in particular is

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,759
very strong

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,399
that's why cyber security has to be

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,679
a top priority in global politics and

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
for every single state

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
this includes national and international

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
cyber defense abilities

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,319
and the protection of critical

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
infrastructure

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,640
like hospitals foreign energy supply

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,599
telecommunication and payment

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,120
transactions

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
that's the level of states eu and nato

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,319
the other level

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,840
the economy

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
and the company level

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
there's a lot of money at stake and in

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,800
some cases the existence of companies

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
the biggest threat is ransomware

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
any company can be target of cyber

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,640
criminals big middle-sized and small

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
businesses

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
cyber security also has a huge impact on

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
our societies

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
our modern societies are highly

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
interconnected

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,159
interdependent specialized

72
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,400
that's why we are

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
successful

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
but we are also vulnerable

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,680
if it systems are disrupted

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
this can lead to big problems for public

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
safety and security

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
public authorities

79
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,680
could be unable to operate there could

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
be supply shortages in extreme cases

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,159
human

82
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,799
lives could be at risk for example if

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,159
there is an attack

84
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
on a hospital

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,519
and cyber security affects us also as

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
private individuals examples include

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
for

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,159
fraudulent emails phishing scams fake

89
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,879
stores investment scams are also on the

90
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
rise

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
it is the responsible of the state

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
to ensure

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,879
that people are just as safe in the

94
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
digital world

95
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,879
as they are in the analog world

96
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
trust and security

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,840
that must be our ambition it's a huge

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,439
task

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,040
ladies and gentlemen

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,879
ladies and gentlemen cyber attacks

101
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,720
threaten our privacy our prosperity and

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
our democracy

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
everyone is facing a challenge the

104
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,320
states

105
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
the companies

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
every citizen

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
we do a lot

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
but it's not enough

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,800
the state needs to invest more a lot

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
more

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
and must be strengthened national and

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
international corporations we heard it

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
already today

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
companies must increase their awareness

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
and their cyber resilience

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
every individual must also be aware of

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
the danger

118
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,280
and must be prepared

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
only together we can prevail in the

120
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,639
fight against cybercrime i would think

121
