[Applause]

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,559
well i i think we have heard a lot of

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,520
interesting and inspiring things today

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,160
and i took notes and um

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
in the next couple of hours i would

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
rephrase what we heard no just joking

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
but um i i took some on some things with

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,520
me that is my personal take-home message

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,920
for me myself and i would like to share

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,879
these things with you um and maybe we

19
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
can continue the discussion afterwards

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
uh first of all in the divorce uh

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,200
repeated uh in several panels today we

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
saw that there is a urgent need to

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
enhance international cooperation and

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
beyond the

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
common silos

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,240
be it a company with

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
nato have you heard that we should focus

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,520
on common values and and that is

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,000
something uh that is really important

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
and we we heard uh it's a

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
term i i liked uh the term democratic

32
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
what is this

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,320
democratization

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
of technology i

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
took my note on that i like that

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
because it goes straight the same line

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
uh to um well

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
to agree upon

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
common value that we want to have in the

40
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
technology we want to use and that must

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
be company accompanied by standards by

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
regulation and so we had the high-level

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
thing and it came down to the real

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,239
technology and how to build this kind of

45
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,680
technology

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
so that is something i i love to hear

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,599
and i love to hear and that's what we

48
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
all see

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,480
that

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,519
time being cyber security is important

51
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,680
as ever there is some sort of

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
accelerator to the

53
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,400
through the geopolitical situation we

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
face

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
but what we face here and that's another

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
thing and i

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,519
face it as well that there is some

58
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
before that we had someone said i said i

59
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
think you said it this sense of urgency

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,720
was lacking and now there is these

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,319
urgency sense all around we have another

62
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,480
perception of urgency and a change in

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
risk management we can see and a lot of

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
people had already talked about that and

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
i think that's really true we have a

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,319
change in our perception and urgency and

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,599
management and prioritization and that's

68
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,159
good to have said

69
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
and what i

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
really loved as well that we

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,080
should accept that nothing is perfect

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
that we should put more focus on

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
business continuity

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,720
that we

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
build our systems more resilient to be

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
able to continue despite there are

77
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
attacks there are and there will be

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,360
attacks we should be prepared for doing

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,159
that and that is something we should do

80
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,200
okay

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,400
i've come to the end

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
last but not least and that is an ever

83
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
and ever repeating story and we have it

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
all the years we have these events here

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
that is the skill gap and it is not

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,399
closed yet it might be bigger than ever

87
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,959
that's why i asked mary about her

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,840
instruments as well that's why i asked

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
about uh how to

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
come up with a cultural change what

91
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
should we do uh to come up with a

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
solution to that and that is something i

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
take with me and i love again i want to

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
repeat it i love this

95
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
this image of a training security so

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
that it is

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
something that security is a part of our

98
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
muscle memory it's inside and another

99
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,120
guy here talk said in another panel

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
we want to have a change in culture that

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,759
the people

102
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,880
ask

103
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
for technology that is secure they don't

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
they

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
would refuse to use something that is

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
insecure that would be great if we come

107
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
to up to that but uh it's a long way to

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,360
go go and as i know at this point you

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
wanted to to talk about the skill set as

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
well do you want to join me on the

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,919

114
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,199

who participated in the online digital

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,759
munich cyber security conference on the

118
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,320
16th of february no

119
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
vice president skinas the vice president

of the european commission responsible

121
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
for the security union but also for

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,479
skills

123
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,039
launched the call mostly towards the

124
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,120
industry and many important players are

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
here in the room

126
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,199
to uh come forward with pledges for

127
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,039
traineeships in the area of skills in

128
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
the european union we have a flagship

129
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,319
initiative

130
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,520
called

131
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
pact for skills where we call upon the

132
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
industry to come forward with pledges

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
for young people across europe and then

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
we put our own networks and our own

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
know-how in bringing these close to the

136
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
people and we decided that we would like

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
to make this call this year and come

138
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
forward to next year's conference with

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
the outcome so we'd like to work with

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
peter on this so he is the contact for

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,479
those who are interested and then we'll

142
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,039
take it forward many of you may have

143
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
heard we have won such packed for skills

144
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,360
in the areas of airspace and defense but

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,400
would like to move it further so i know

146
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
you all clapped enthusiastically when

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
chris krebs said if we don't do with

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,759
something we will be back here

149
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
in 30 years talking about the same

150
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
problem so this is a real opportunity

151
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
and this is about big offerings and some

152
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,319
companies that spoke here today are big

153
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
so the pledges have to be equally big

154
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,319
and reach out across the 27 countries so

155
