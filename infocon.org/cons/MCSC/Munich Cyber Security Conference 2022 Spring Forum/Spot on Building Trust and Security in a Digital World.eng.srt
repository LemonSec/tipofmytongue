[Music]

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,160
oh

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,920
thanks so much for joining me it was

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,400
mentioned the spot on panel has been a

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
regular feature here at the conference

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,480
as veterans of the conference know

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
you might also know it comes with

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
strengths attached because i'm always

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
told by the organizers this is supposed

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,640
to be the fun panel it's supposed to be

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,840
more

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,359
i mean of course all the panels are

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,880
hilarious but

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
no pressure here so

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
just to build up expectations

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
i will let you in on the secret

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,399
apparently in the past years we haven't

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
lived up to expectations because this

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,399
time i was reminded that it's supposed

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
to be fun and optimistic so we are

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
supposed to focus on the opportunities

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,239
of cyber security so we are widely

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
determined here to folk to be widely

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
optimistic to focus to see every threat

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,440
as an opportunity of course

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
during the panel and it's going to be

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,559
easy because i have here on the panel

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,920
not just

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,320
wildly qualified but also wildly

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
cheerful people i suppose

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,920
mary uh who is with ibm who is a

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
general manager of ibm security is the

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
largest enterprise security company in

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
the world period no further introduction

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
needed

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,520
central um who

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,439
is not just executive vice president of

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
mandiant in dc

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
but also pursuing a phd at johns hopkins

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
currently it's not for a lack of degrees

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,320
because she already holds an mba at from

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,040
mit and also master's degrees in cyber

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
policy international affairs science and

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
technology intelligence and military

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
operational art and science did i forget

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,880
one no that's all yeah

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
that's all you have

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,159
then we have of course here marcus uh

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,600
sorry there

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
marcus who is uh the group cio at

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
ohb in bremen one of the leading german

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
space companies and we have christopher

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,719
right here

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,199
who has not just five granted software

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
patterns but also multiple pending so

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
there's more to come

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
i'm looking forward to the discussion i

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
would like to start with you mary uh in

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
the spirit

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
spirit of our more optimistic outlook it

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
is often said that uh people um are the

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,959
most vulnerable gateway for attacker

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
resources so how do you build a con in a

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
huge organization like ibm how do you

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,640
build a more constructive culture i mean

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,239
how do you make sure that people are not

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,239
just the problem when it comes to cyber

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,120
security but also part of the solution

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
yeah so thank you for having me here

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
it's a pleasure and so yeah i believe um

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
people can be the weakest link and um so

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,840
we take the opportunity to educate our

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
people you've just got to create

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,319
awareness

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,680
um got to create awareness of

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,200
you know the level of activity um that's

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
needed the level of understanding of um

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
digital education digital literacy but

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
also understand that

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
involving um

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
your people from

83
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
the receptionist to the boardroom can be

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
the source of um exploiting a

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
vulnerability in your system and so

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
everybody plays a part and everybody

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
needs to understand the part they play

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
so it's all about education it's all

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
about testing that your education is

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
effective

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,840
and

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
just

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
also exercising the muscle memory in

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
trials and tests and so on just like you

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
would a fire alarm so everybody can be

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,959
the weakest link but everybody can be

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
part of the solution

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,159
how do you make sure that people are

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,440
rather part of the solution than the

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
weakest link yeah you you educate them

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
but then you run your fire drills and

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
you make sure that they've deeply

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
embedded in their muscle memory is how

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
they behave how they should behave and

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
how to ensure that they're not the

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
weakest link

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
senator with your huge experience both

108
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
in the public and private sector how do

109
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,280
you make sure

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
that people are drive or how do you

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
identify drivers of trust in

112
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,438
organizations

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,720
i think that we think about people quite

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,520
a bit when we think about solutions

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
and i think that there's limitations to

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
what we can expect through you know

117
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,120
augmenting or shaping a workforce

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
um vince surf from google said something

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
very poignant that i i think about a lot

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
which is that there was a time when

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
there were so many

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
telephone operators who are manually

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
connecting calls that it was projected

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
that almost every adult in the united

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
states at some point would have to be a

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
telephone operator to meet that demand

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
but what we did was we created

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
you know direct dial assist

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
and now we thankfully can have other

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,800
jobs besides besides that so

131
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,199
i'm thinking about technology solutions

132
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,000
for

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
to drive some of these trust issues um

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
not always thinking about the the

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,639
fallacies or the

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,560
the weaknesses that people bring because

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,479
they always will bring it but what

138
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
innovations and what technology can we

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
put in place that will reduce these work

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
force shortages that will make uh trust

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
architectures more efficient and require

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
less human intervention i know there are

143
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
downsides i know there are there are

144
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
you know ethical questions and those

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,639
things obviously need to be need to be

146
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,280
part of that but you know let's give

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
innovation a chance when we do this

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
speaking of innovation christopher not

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
just many patents but um

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
i know that to most people here in the

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
room the concept of

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
open security is

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,240
something they are very familiar with

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
explain it to cyber idiots like me or

155
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
other people in the audience that are

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
not aware of what is meant by open

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,759
security

158
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
so actually i don't really know what you

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,120
mean by openstack okay when you say it

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
well and lightness well just the idea

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
that

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
you might work with open security

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
systems that are publicly available and

164
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
i think you say open source open source

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,199
that's right so no if you think about it

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,520
so in the world of security for the

167
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
longest time intelligence has been

168
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,319
something that is very secret and it's

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,120
something that we can generate

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,199
if you want secure a secure world a

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,840
world of trust and so based on secret

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,720
intelligence and mi6 and spice and what

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
have you i think and and many with me

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,840
that there is a new world out there with

175
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
the most important intelligence is

176
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
actually collected off the web it's

177
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
based on open sources is inherently

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
shareable his historical intelligence if

179
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
i have a secret and i'm going to get it

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
to you you wrote about all the in intel

181
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
stuff and you know people will kill to

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
keep it secret in the world of open

183
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
source we can actually share

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
intelligence we can develop trust much

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
much better and i think actually being

186
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,080
able to deal with sort of fundamentally

187
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,360
address

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
cyber security through open open

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
information if you want to or open

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
source intelligence is maybe one of

191
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
those ways we can build a better

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
internet i like to use the analogy of

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
financial markets imagine if we built

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
financial markets based on only secret

195
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
information it would be pretty crappy

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
financial markets to be full of bad

197
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,400
actors trying to take advantage of

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
themselves of of each other

199
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,319
in in financial markets we have

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,479
companies like bloomberg that actually

201
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,039
provides information flow because of

202
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
that information flow that is open to to

203
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,639
to most participants in the market

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,280
financial markets are largely great and

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
i think this is a key component we've

206
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
been missing in not just in cyber

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
security but in in as it relates to the

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,400
internet may be very large and that's

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,599
what we're trying to do at recorded

210
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
future be the equivalent of bloomberg in

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,240
cyber security how do you encourage

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
particularly companies to be less

213
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
secretive in that regard because it i

214
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,240
mean obviously they're often not

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
inclined to share that kind of

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
information does it need more public

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
regulation or does it need more

218
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,479
incentives to

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
it's a great point so there's been a lot

220
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
of talk about information sharing here

221
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,919
today and

222
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,160
to be honest 20 years of information

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
sharing has led nowhere we our internet

224
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
is worse off today than it was 20 years

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,599
ago that's the i could say it in a

226
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,640
subtle way

227
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,039
optimistic yeah i know but no i think

228
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
i'm optimistic about the future

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
so so

230
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
it's literally the internet has gone

231
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,640
worse in 20 years and as much as we have

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
information sharing left right and so on

233
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
because lawyers

234
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
don't allow you to share information and

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
any sane person who's been in a bad

236
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
situation it's not going to let you

237
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
share the juicy stuff either but if we

238
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
can base build open source intelligence

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,720
we can actually address this if it's

240
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,959
shared on a common platform so marcus to

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
the rescue here would you would you say

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
that everything has gotten worse over

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,560
the past two decades in the internet

244
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
from a security standpoint yes i think

245
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
from a usability standpoint we we went

246
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
through a hyperloop of innovation maybe

247
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
yeah everything changed we have all

248
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
these social media we have

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
influences we have just if you look at

250
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
your kids and the young generation here

251
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
how we deal with information uh we gave

252
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
away information not a target show or

253
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
something like that yeah we look at tick

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
tock and we look at the channels so so

255
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,600
lots of things changed

256
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,160
also information is available to

257
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
everyone

258
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
not all it's not always good yeah

259
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
because you also have to learn how to

260
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
deal with this overflow of information

261
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,160
but in general i think from an

262
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
information stand point of view it

263
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,160
became better however everything became

264
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
networked yeah we learned about years

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
ago about these internet of things and

266
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
all these billion of things that will

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
communicate with each other so from a

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
security stand point of view i think it

269
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
became worse because you have this

270
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
network effect we we just learned about

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
this log4j issue yeah where's one

272
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,079
piece of code just a string yeah that

273
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,279
hits billions of devices all of a sudden

274
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,240
so um it's on one hand a huge chance on

275
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
the other hand a huge risk or speaking

276
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
of that because i'm married just to

277
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,200
bring

278
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
bring you back into the discussion i

279
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,519
mean cyberspace is not just one galaxy

280
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,760
it's a galaxy of so many things now if

281
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
you think of the internet of things i

282
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,920
mean how can security prevail in that

283
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
environment i mean what do you tell your

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
people on the one hand you are trying to

285
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,120
build the internet of things and on the

286
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
other hand you want more security in

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
that

288
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,920
i'm kind of going to bring you a little

289
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,640
bit back to open and uh chris did say

290
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,079
what do you mean by open so i'll give

291
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,120
you another definition um so

292
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
i think um

293
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
how you can be optimistic here is

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,839
security is a team sport and we heard on

295
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,519
all of the other panels about the need

296
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
for collaboration the need for

297
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,800
collaboration across state boundaries um

298
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
you know among organizations across the

299
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
various different regions within germany

300
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,079
and etc

301
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,640
and you know while um you can put

302
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
frameworks in place and legislation in

303
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
place and have all kinds of aspirations

304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,079
to make collaboration effective you also

305
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
can rely on technology too

306
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,120
and

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
there has been significant progression

308
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,480
in the generation of

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
open standards and technology based on

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,279
open standards to make it actually

311
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,040
possible for for security intelligence

312
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
security insights security information

313
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,519
to be shared so that we can collectively

314
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,040
whether we're partners whether we're

315
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
competitors you know whoever we are we

316
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
can actually choose to share and improve

317
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
um our hand and improve discipline look

318
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
christopher there is hope is there too

319
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
rosy and out there is absolutely hope

320
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,399
the world has become better over the

321
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
last 20 years but then at the same time

322
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,079
you take tick tock which is says

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,600
programming badness straight into

324
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,959
people's heads

325
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
that's a new definition of tick-tock

326
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
what is your take on that

327
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
let's say we we we're not very fun yet i

328
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,399
just have to say this yeah i know i know

329
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,920
but we have 29 minutes left so go ahead

330
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,360
um so the take on specifically the which

331
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
part of of

332
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
what where what was your uh focus on the

333
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
question well the idea primarily

334
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,160
if things had gotten really worse over

335
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
the past two decades and on the other

336
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
hand if cooperation is

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
more likely or more possible now look

338
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,519
the internet is a is a tool for us so

339
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
really it is as good or as bad and as

340
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,560
useful or as detrimental as we shape it

341
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,440
to be

342
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,760
and i think that that puts the problem

343
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
and the solution in our hands and you

344
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
know from my organization what we have

345
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
done is we run

346
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,519
at you know in my my group is

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
the world's largest

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,279
commercial intelligence organization

349
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
focused on cyber that's not connected to

350
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,399
a government

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
and through that what we have found was

352
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
that we can open the aperture of the

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,120
government view and do some of that

354
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
sharing of of intelligence to better

355
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
decision making the optimistic part of

356
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,200
this is that i can tell you that in in

357
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
the cyber security industry

358
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
even our competitors are our partners

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
when things get rough and when things

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
get serious

361
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,279
my first calls sometimes are to my

362
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,760
competitors do you see this because you

363
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
need to let your customers know this is

364
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,399
serious

365
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
so you would say the sharing of threat

366
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,680
intelligence has really improved over

367
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,959
the years i can give you a perfect

368
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
example after the solomoni killing we

369
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,680
saw passwords spraying all throughout

370
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
europe and the united states to critical

371
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,680
infrastructure

372
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,760
and i called

373
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,079
one of my my competitors who i knew had

374
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,480
some presence in the space i told him

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
what we're seeing not customer data not

376
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,480
you know but threat data threat

377
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,839
information

378
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,279
they said they were saying the same

379
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,760
thing and then we could work together to

380
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
protect everybody a global security

381
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,399
community does exist

382
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,199
and

383
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,279
shared values across is what we've been

384
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,040
talking about through this

385
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
it exists in the global security

386
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,920
community i i've i've felt it i've seen

387
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
it

388
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,639
it's organizations countries governments

389
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,360
who share a vision for humanity that is

390
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
not just democracy

391
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,360
because we've seen that some democracies

392
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
are illiberal democracies let's call it

393
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,199
not the right kind of democracy but

394
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,920
one's more socontian tradition of

395
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,839
individual liberties and representative

396
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,720
government and that type of democracy so

397
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,800
you know we we are working together in

398
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
the cyber security community um even

399
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
competitors i've lived it i know in your

400
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
organization as well so there's there's

401
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
room for hope mark is you're i know you

402
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
have european roots as well but you're

403
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
the european one here on the panel

404
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
because you're literally based in europe

405
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,320
i mean for many years people said here

406
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
in europe well it can be a you usp for

407
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
us or for our companies if we have a

408
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,240
higher security standard and it is good

409
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
for business ultimately i mean is that

410
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
still true or have you seen

411
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,279
any of that hope fulfilled over the

412
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,440
years well i think first of all we

413
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
should not mix up data privacy and cyber

414
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,199
security i think european paradigm is

415
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,120
always okay we keep the data privacy

416
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
high

417
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,720
sell this as a usp and i think the idea

418
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
is good yeah however how it is

419
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,759
implemented is bad yeah if you open a

420
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,800
website of any kind you just click away

421
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,279
a privacy note and you're not

422
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,959
even

423
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,920
taking

424
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,160
with you what is in there yeah so you do

425
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,399
not know what you do or you know what

426
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,079
you accept if you click away these

427
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,600
things

428
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,079
so how it is realized is quite difficult

429
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,000
the idea is good and i think it will be

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
a usp because people will want to have

431
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
their privacy

432
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
and

433
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,440
we can see that all our world and it's

434
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
also i think a political dimension yeah

435
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,920
can we guarantee privacy in democratic

436
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,639
camp countries yeah and and we can see

437
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,759
in china now in russia

438
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,160
the people they do not have this freedom

439
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,199
and maybe by manipulation we're not

440
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,000
suffering by that but i think in a from

441
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
a democratic point of view um this is a

442
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
usp and i think also if you look to the

443
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,240
u.s we have similar movements yeah not

444
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
to that extent not so extreme yeah we

445
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
learned already that the europeans but

446
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
we're very good in regulating

447
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
um and probably sometimes we're also

448
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,519
over regulating yeah but so the truth is

449
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,440
as always in the middle yeah and i hope

450
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
what we learned from what we did and

451
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,320
that we can also adjust that

452
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
you spoke initially about educating

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,680
people in your organization i mean you

454
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
know and it was mentioned in the

455
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
previous panel as well you have a huge

456
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
skills gap often i mean particularly

457
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,000
among

458
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
younger and older employees and also

459
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
people in the public and the private

460
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,119
sector i mean what tools can you use to

461
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,959
close that skills gap i mean can

462
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,599
artificial intelligence be a tool that

463
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
or that is already being used absolutely

464
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
artificial intelligence has been used

465
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,919
dramatically um

466
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,359
we use it throughout our entire

467
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,599
portfolio of products and services and

468
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
all of our competitors and partners use

469
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
artificial intelligence because if you

470
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
consider

471
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
how

472
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,080
how much cyber security data needs to be

473
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,000
processed in order to find the needle in

474
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
the haystack that is the important piece

475
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
that you need to respond to

476
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,760
if you consider the volume of that data

477
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,720
humans simply cannot deal with it so you

478
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
do need

479
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
you know compute power and you need

480
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
assistance to the human in order to be

481
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,960
able to process that level of data and

482
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,480
in order to do the right level of

483
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
analytics to be able to

484
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,360
you know

485
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
separate the wheat from the chaff you

486
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,919
know essentially um so artificial

487
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
intelligence is being used and

488
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,039
automation is being used because you've

489
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,480
got to automate

490
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
the um

491
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,559
you know the the low level of of

492
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,360
activity that needs to be progressed so

493
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,039
that the short

494
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
and the short supply security and

495
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
analytics or analysis can actually face

496
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,600
and deal with you know the high value

497
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
work that needs to be done so

498
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
absolutely um artificial intelligence

499
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
but it needs to be transparent and it

500
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
needs to be ethical and it needs to be

501
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
curated it needs to be watched

502
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
and significant automation i believe are

503
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
um significant answers to the shortage

504
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
in um

505
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
you were nodding heavily so i suppose

506
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
you agree i'll i'll be equally

507
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,000
optimistic here actually you know for

508
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,440
once finally

509
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
so absolutely so intelligence for

510
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
example historically has been a very

511
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,039
manual effort and so i'm not an analyst

512
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
by background i'm a computer scientist

513
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,559
when we attacked that problem we said

514
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,640
look let's think about this as a data

515
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,720
problem and and then we could do what

516
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
mary said and sort of attack

517
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
intelligence and and you think about

518
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
mark anderson's story from 10 years ago

519
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,760
where he said

520
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,520
software is eating the universe eating

521
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
the world and and so software can eat

522
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
intelligence as well and so that's the

523
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
sort of the way we've gone at that then

524
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,679
secondly on the point on sort of i think

525
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,280
when it comes to hiring and bringing on

526
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
people and so on and people especially

527
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
in cyber security it's oh it's so hard

528
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,480
to find people and

529
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
but it's because they don't want to go

530
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,160
out this in a the real way where you

531
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,400
sort of go hire people from you know

532
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,799
basically off the street kids in school

533
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
and try to educate them from bottoms up

534
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,640
and of course if you're trying to hire

535
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
the guy with 25 years experience and

536
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
they sort of go round around and in some

537
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,320
i don't know what it is

538
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
they apply terrible strategies to a

539
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
problem that doesn't work out for them

540
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,440
and then they sit and whine about it you

541
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
can hire people for out of school and

542
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
you can educate and uh we can do that

543
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,679
and if we can do it then many people can

544
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,640
do it

545
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
we need to talk about optimistic points

546
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
i know we need to talk about a few

547
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,280
issues though that are neither funny nor

548
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
particularly optimistic there were

549
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
warnings a few weeks ago about malware

550
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
that was already addressed on other

551
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
panels about pipe dream uh that sounds

552
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
like a plot from a james bond movie but

553
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,200
it seems to be very real

554
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
sandra how concerned are you about such

555
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
new developments malware that we call in

556
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
controller is something that we have

557
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,760
done a very deep dive on and the

558
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,159
disconcerting part about it and you're

559
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,919
right this part's not the good news not

560
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,760
the optimistic news is that it attacks

561
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
safety systems of industrial control

562
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
systems it reminds me of 2017's triton

563
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,919
malware which accidentally possibly shut

564
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,720
down an oil and gas facility

565
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,280
in such a reckless way and thereby

566
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
endangering the lives of people

567
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
so should we be worried we should

568
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,480
definitely be worried that there's a

569
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
capability

570
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
probably russian although we haven't

571
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
done the attribution completely on that

572
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,520
yet but i would say that we've seen

573
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
capability we've seen in tent we have

574
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
seen the um gru deploy

575
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,159
recklessly sort of wormable exploits

576
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,880
around the world so in this way i think

577
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,159
we need to be

578
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,760
thinking that

579
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,120
um you know a a friend of mine has said

580
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,559
that it is

581
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,120
not a technology problem but a russia

582
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
north korea in a china problem dimitri

583
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,400
alperovitch so i agree with him in that

584
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
we will not solve this

585
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
on the defense side we're not going to

586
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
solve it that way we're going to need to

587
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,039
go to root causes we're going to need to

588
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,240
talk to

589
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,039
the builders of this the the those who

590
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,360
harbored those who provide safe haven

591
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
those who use cyber tools recklessly

592
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
have to be taken to account we need to

593
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,960
start being

594
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
very proactive in those things and now

595
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,559
we're in an environment where we've

596
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,799
probably waited too long because we are

597
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
now in a crisis mode and how are we

598
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,640
going to start that diplomatic process

599
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
or at least carry out the diplomatic

600
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
process we're in the middle of dealing

601
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
with um

602
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
you know what i will call hand-to-hand

603
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
combat in the cyber domain tactical use

604
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
of wipers against organizations and

605
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
people in ukraine and we're watching it

606
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,080
now the scenario i worry about is these

607
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,039
same actors doing a not pecha event

608
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
using wipers

609
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
think about that for a second but that

610
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
would do to all of us well you addressed

611
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
russia explicitly so we need to talk

612
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
about russia too marcus

613
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
i use so far underwhelmed by the russian

614
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
performance when it comes to cyber war

615
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
because people were expecting

616
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,480
more

617
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
yeah we had we saw already earlier

618
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
nobody knows what is already in our

619
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,919
systems yeah

620
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,320
at least on the attack side what we can

621
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,039
observe regarding our own risk we can

622
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,000
also see that the attacks are going down

623
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
because it seems that the attackers are

624
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,880
busy

625
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,520
in another war room yeah

626
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,000
so this is for the moment a positive

627
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
effect but you should never feel safe

628
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,559
yeah we have to be prepared for next

629
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,720
time and we had it already earlier

630
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,039
talking about the 80 security no one is

631
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,000
able to ensure 100 security whatever we

632
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,039
do um so i think we also have to improve

633
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,679
our capabilities to react yeah and then

634
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,000
it's it's not even heck back yeah we

635
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
just have to be able to react uh

636
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,720
if our defense is not successful and i

637
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
think we are pretty weak in that area

638
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,120
too yeah we're focusing too much on on

639
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,320
defense on identifying an attack but now

640
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
how do we react in terms of

641
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
survivability in terms of resilience

642
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,919
that's that's i think a big point not

643
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,919
only for critical infrastructure but

644
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
also for corporations yeah in order to

645
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,039
safeguard their business to come back to

646
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,039
our panel's topic building trust and

647
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,520
security when we talk about russia which

648
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,360
is an important factor in this whole

649
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,840
equation i mean how do you

650
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,919
i mean let's say two or three years from

651
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,840
now how are we going to rebuild trust

652
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,960
with russia in the cyber space community

653
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
i think unfortunately you're vastly

654
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
optimistic if you think two three years

655
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
is decades yeah this is decades to sort

656
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
of be able because it's true that i

657
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
think senator was right on we're not

658
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,720
going to solve this by dealing with

659
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,480
computers you're going to have to see

660
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,600
arrests in russia of cyber criminals

661
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
they don't need to be extradited but

662
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,559
they need to be arrested

663
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,400
and their computers need to be taken

664
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
away because not you know you will catch

665
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,720
some of them in in spain they seem to

666
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,480
like to go to spain and then boom we

667
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,760
snatch them

668
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,720
and and

669
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,080
it's actually true

670
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,000
but the but we're not going to be able

671
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
to do that on moss and and so we're

672
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,320
going to have i eventually will be able

673
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
to do that but unfortunately here go a

674
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
little bit negative now a whole bunch of

675
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,840
russian engineers are going to run out

676
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
of jobs

677
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
and some small very small portion but

678
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,279
maybe enough pe set of people are going

679
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,880
to lose their ability to make money and

680
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
they'll drift more into this so no

681
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
unfortunately that part is not very

682
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
optimistic you would say it will take

683
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
decades to rebuild that trust or decades

684
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
of trust have been destroyed now i don't

685
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,159
really know what the difference is but

686
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
it will take a long time how about that

687
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,200
center just come back to that briefly

688
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
because on the international level there

689
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,200
have been many efforts also to cooperate

690
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
with i mean sometimes russia has even

691
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,279
been the driver on these issues so you

692
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,000
think that is over now entirely or

693
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,360
is there hope

694
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
i think that they have completely

695
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,159
crushed

696
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:36,960
any

697
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
um

698
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
any trust

699
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
through their actions on several levels

700
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,039
not just the cyber domain but but let's

701
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,279
be realistic for a second

702
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,840
we've been tracking russian actors doing

703
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
malicious activity

704
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,880
conducting reckless attacks

705
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
for years

706
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,039
we know which organizations are doing it

707
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,960
they have missions they come from the

708
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
gru the svr the ffsb they have a mission

709
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
a standing mission to do these things

710
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
they did them before they're doing them

711
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
now and they're going to do them into

712
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
the future

713
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
because that is their mission that is

714
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
their job

715
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,039
to conduct espionage to create malware

716
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,000
to have um to to carry these things out

717
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
for their political ends so therefore

718
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,039
just back to it it's a it's a political

719
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,760
problem and it's a hard political

720
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
problem and people a lot smarter than me

721
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,520
are going to need to solve it and

722
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
probably our kids

723
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
but i think you would also agree that

724
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
it's been pretty remarkable to see

725
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,600
what's been going on in ukraine so you

726
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,559
know speaking in extremely general terms

727
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
seeing how we've been able to help there

728
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,520
and being you know put

729
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,320
i'll just say very vaguely put things to

730
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,480
work and not just sort of what we've

731
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
been able to do but in collaboration

732
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
with others

733
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,320
in you know in here really talk about

734
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,480
public private sort of partnerships that

735
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
have emerged in weeks

736
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,799
and and you know maybe months by now has

737
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
been remarkable and and you know now

738
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,559
it's always hard with this sort of stuff

739
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,120
to say what stopped what and what time

740
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,360
and so on but even in the short tour

741
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
time frame you know

742
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,760
observing that that is cause for real

743
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,000
optimism would you agree coming from the

744
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,159
private sector this is a new level now

745
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,080
in this public private partnership oh

746
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,200
definitely absolutely definitely um

747
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
i mean anything that can be done

748
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,880
to

749
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,240
to help um the ukrainians has been done

750
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,919
um whether that's from the private

751
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,240
sector or the public sector and every

752
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,320
opportunity to collaborate

753
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,320
and just um remove any friction and any

754
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,880
sound from their machine has been done

755
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,640
and will be done yes

756
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,760
you had a strong opinion maybe uh what

757
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,080
comes to my mind uh when it comes to

758
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
trust and uh i'm a practitioner yeah

759
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,679
day-to-day uh i.t business management uh

760
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,919
so it's not about of a trust to russia

761
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,320
and so on when i think about it's more

762
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,640
about the trust in between public

763
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,679
private and then also trust to american

764
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,159
companies yeah and this is a big issue

765
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,080
we also have a big audience from the

766
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
government and

767
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,279
sector here from european governments

768
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,440
we are afraid of using american

769
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
technologies yeah and this is just a

770
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,760
matter of trust yeah the lack of trust

771
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
the lack of control we have these

772
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,480
discussions about serenity

773
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,200
of european data uh so we don't even

774
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
trust each other yeah maybe the

775
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
europeans trust the europeans but not

776
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
over or even the germans trust the

777
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,960
french yeah so so and i think here

778
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,080
uh we have to develop maybe a community

779
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,679
that builds trust amongst western

780
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
democracies yeah

781
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,640
that our platforms can be used by each

782
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,039
other without having every time the

783
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,200
discussion and we start with a workers

784
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,960
council about where data are not being

785
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
processed by americans

786
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,399
this ends up

787
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,520
with

788
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,399
government authorities about tax data

789
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,120
and so on that might be processed

790
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,360
in another country and i think this is

791
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,600
an issue if we want to be strong

792
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
um against these uh

793
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,320
eastern uh

794
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,120
attackers yeah we

795
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,840
all

796
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
first of all we have to find ourselves

797
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,600
yeah and build a stronger command

798
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,799
community

799
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,520
uh in western democracies okay there's

800
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
optimism there too so we have we have 30

801
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
national security centers slash certs on

802
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the same what we think about because we

803
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
think ourselves as a transatlantic

804
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,880
company so we have 30 ncscs around the

805
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
world on our same platform and having

806
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
through that one data set that is shared

807
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
that people can share analytical

808
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,720
techniques on and i think that's pretty

809
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
tremendous progress that would not have

810
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
happened 10 years ago but having this

811
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
sort of is just again tremendous

812
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,279
progress and seeing this then being a

813
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,600
channel to what's going on on the again

814
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
defensive side in ukraine is pretty

815
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,080
remarkable so we're doing progress we're

816
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,159
doing probably our basic note again yeah

817
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,000
uh two quick questions to uh sandra and

818
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
mary before we open it up to the

819
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
audience uh

820
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,600
one to you sarah essendra do you think

821
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
this current crisis that was uh

822
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,360
described by marcus is that a sea change

823
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
when it comes to

824
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
trusting each other

825
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,520
particularly on a transatlantic level

826
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,919
because you see that alliance in a way

827
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,600
now in ukraine

828
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,840
well i think it certainly created a

829
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,679
sense of urgency around sharing um

830
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,919
the uh there's a bit of a hierarchy

831
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,399
though in you know ukraine has a lot of

832
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,760
new friends

833
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,360
right and there are some older friends

834
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
who who've been um helping there for

835
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,159
over a decade such as are you implying

836
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,720
that germany is a new friend right so

837
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,679
you know i i think that it is uh you

838
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,600
know there is cause for

839
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,279
for um a new paradigm after this i think

840
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
that one thing that we know is that um

841
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,000
it would be great if we had a better way

842
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,720
to sift through all the helpful things

843
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,519
that

844
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
all of ukraine's you know the government

845
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,960
and partners there all of the new um and

846
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,519
dilute you know just a huge amount of

847
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,440
information wanting to be passed we

848
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,159
don't really have a good mechanism to do

849
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,799
that in order to then you know what are

850
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,480
the functions and you know of getting

851
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,919
intelligence you want to be able to

852
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,320
detect blocked you know prioritize and

853
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
respond and you want to do that as fast

854
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,880
as possible hopefully by automation but

855
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,679
when you can't you need to use judgment

856
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,519
so is it is it a new day in in trust and

857
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,760
all that i think it's a it's an urgent

858
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,640
time

859
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,760
and we should learn a lesson here for

860
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,720
the next time that oh i don't know

861
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
another

862
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,080
autocratic government tries to take over

863
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,519
a territory

864
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,519
um in its space

865
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,799
that maybe we need we will find

866
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,240
ourselves in the exact same position

867
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,159
hopefully we've learned something very

868
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,080
speaking of trust does it undermine

869
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,840
trust in american companies particularly

870
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,240
in silicon valley companies like google

871
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,559
amazon others so if they are sometimes

872
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,519
seen

873
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,159
as warriors too because they are engaged

874
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,559
in cyber war activities or do research

875
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,240
in these areas it's not a new

876
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
development of course it's not it didn't

877
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,960
just happen but do you see that as a

878
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,480
problem in the medium term well i think

879
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,039
okay trust is earned and trust is earned

880
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,720
by

881
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,080
behavior

882
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,720
consistent behavior over a period of

883
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,559
time and

884
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,519
you know

885
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,760
all of these major organizations and i'm

886
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,279
not going to talk about any of them

887
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,840
individually you know they earn trust or

888
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,960
they do not based on how they behave and

889
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,519
um and how they operate and

890
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,399
and i just feel that um

891
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,799
you know transparency and ethical

892
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,240
behavior and um and that demonstrated

893
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,080
over a period of time is what will

894
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,200
determine

895
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
whether you're trusted or not um i think

896
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,919
you're so right as a hundred percent so

897
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,919
i started my company we had google and

898
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,399
inc utel as an investor we had teresa

899
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,159
shea on the board who you know you've

900
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,159
probably written about sir alex younger

901
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,919
is on the board so like it's in one

902
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,080
level as american blah blah blah and the

903
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,840
whole sort of thing as you could but at

904
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,679
the same time we work with 30 countries

905
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,559
in at the national level we speak 40

906
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,480
languages at the company and if you sort

907
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,000
of develop a trust and b act in you know

908
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,240
not the sort of classic american sort of

909
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
way it's absolutely doable

910
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,360
thanks so much dear panel uh my takeaway

911
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,039
is that the past 20 years have been

912
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,279
rough but the next 20 years are going to

913
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,519
be even rougher but we will remain

914
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,080
cheerful thanks for that and a big shout

915
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,200
out to our panel thank you
