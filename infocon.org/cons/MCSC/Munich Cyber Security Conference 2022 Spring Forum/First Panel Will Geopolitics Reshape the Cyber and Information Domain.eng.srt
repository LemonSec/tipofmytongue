how geopolitics will shape cyber

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,480
security and how cyber security will

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
reshape

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840

alright still working i guess

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,119
okay

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,640
so i initially i wanted to start with

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,479
the ukrainian war but we heard a much so

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,119
ready so let's make a quick round to all

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,640
of you and maybe start with this being

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
here on my right what surprised you

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
about the digital dimension in the

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,280
ukrainian

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
russian ukrainian war whether it's

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
disinformation whether it's activists

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,119
whether it's the cyber dimension or the

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,000
lack of the cyber dimension

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,160
thank you and allow me to take this

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,400
opportunity to thank the organizers

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,319
thank peter mooring the munich security

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
conference it is wonderful to be back

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
and i think at this point in time it was

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
necessary

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
it's not just delightful because we see

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
each other again but it's because it's

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
important we start talking

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,280
um

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
this is a a question for a historian who

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
has to tell us in which wars we had

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,160
surprises or not my personal view is

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,959
that

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,680
in in a war situation everything is

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
nothing is a surprise

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,760
so i think uh you may hear views saying

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
well we expected the huge cyber attacks

74
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,120
or

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
or not i wouldn't go there i think what

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
will be a surprise

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
will be an outcome uh in our

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,239
collaboration when i come here to what

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,879
president eva said very correctly it was

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,560
the end of his intervention his

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
brilliant intervention if we don't learn

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
lessons from this in collaborating more

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
for these occasions when this happens

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,239
i think

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
what surprised us all is that we have

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
identified once again we do not have

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,519
mechanisms for

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
working together we don't have a

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
coalition of the not only of the willing

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
but of the good

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,280
of those that are like-minded

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,159
and

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,720
we find ourselves sharing information

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
very old style

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
and in europe we have been trying to

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,480
establish the relevant mechanisms and

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
they start to work but we're still not

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
there and it should not just happen in

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
europe in europe we have a privilege we

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,799
are 27 countries that work together and

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,920
you saw that when it came to the

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
ukrainian war one of our biggest

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
strengths was the solidarity between us

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
and that solidarity transcends down to

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,680
cyber issues so we see more exchanges we

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
see more collaboration that is for sure

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
but it shouldn't just be about inside

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
the european union we have to go further

109
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,159
we need to work with other jurisdictions

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,840
as i mentioned the like-minded and for

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
me what will be a surprise is if we keep

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
on forgetting to do this

113
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,760
working together to deal with our issues

114
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
we know that there is cyber warfare

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,519
happening we heard

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
a lot of facts

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
we know and those who work inside cyber

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
security know even more that there are

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
people out there hacktivism is at its

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,639
highest probably that we have seen

121
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,919
we have hikers uh hackers for hire we

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
have uh pro warfare people we have anti

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
warfare people we have law enforcement

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
working against all that all this is

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,479
happening in this great collaboration

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
but we need political geopolitical

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
collaboration and the surprise will be

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
if we don't do that

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
the surprise will be if we can maintain

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
it in the long run but we will see so

131
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,880
eva

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,120
did you expect a cyber pearl harbor or

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,759
where your expectations were more muted

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,360
with regard to cyber activity in the

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
conflict

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
well i think from the region where i

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
come and i come from latvia and my

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
husband from estonia basically i think

139
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
nothing was a surprise to us

140
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,680
we are used to live next door to russia

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
and i think everything that we build and

142
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
everything that we do in our countries

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,160
we always keep that in background should

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
it be economy should it be

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
military or should it be any digital

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,960
solution and we we have to say also that

147
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
baltic states are very advanced in

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
digital so in no way that has stopped us

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
to be digitally well connected putting

150
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
services online making everything

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
digitally available yet

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,520
i i think we have been building that

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,000
constantly thinking who is our neighbor

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
and what what temptations that neighbor

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
might have also in digital realm so that

156
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
doesn't come as a surprise

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
what's happening

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
as as we know anything that happens in

159
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
real life

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
actually is mirrored in digital in one

161
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
or another way we see digital events

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
accompanying

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,160
to what extent i actually think we can

164
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
do much better and we have to do much

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
more on cyber security but i think we

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
can also take a bit of credit

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,319
certainly in all baltic states we have

168
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,080
seen a very extensive sort of a search

169
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,400
and looking for vulnerabilities for

170
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
flaws

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
we have seen and experienced attempts to

172
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
attack and we have been rather resilient

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
to withstand so i i think the same could

174
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,120
be said about ukraine i think

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,680
from the first invasion of russia they

176
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
have actually done rather good job and

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
we might also assume that as

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,160
as

179
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
as in many domains russia actually is

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
doing a floppy job and not very good

181
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
organized not very well structured and

182
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
actually not delivering even if

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
technically they could

184
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,360
maybe the question whether someone is

185
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
surprised by the activity or the lack of

186
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,720
activity depends on the region where

187
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
you're located and i'm pretty sure that

188
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
the baltic states are you know at the

189
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
front lines in this domain and therefore

190
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
have different sets of experiences as we

191
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
have maybe in germany who are a little

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
bit late in the game i might add

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,520
ironically so caroline what's what's

194
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
your assessment from the german side of

195
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
things

196
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,720
um

197
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,280
most of what we saw in terms of

198
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,039
i'll speak more about the disinformation

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,039
than the cyber aspect

200
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,280
there has been nothing new

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,319
because

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
we've seen that ukraine has been a

203
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
someone called it a petri dish for

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
russia for a long time so all the

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
information disinformation campaigns

206
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
that we're seeing right now they have

207
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
been there before if anything it has

208
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,039
increased in let's say craziness the

209
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,840
tone has become harsher i would say the

210
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
gloves are off

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
what

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
surprised me personally the most was the

213
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,000
fact

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
or the suspicion

215
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
to what extent russia disinformed itself

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,759
because in some ways i cannot help but

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
feel that they fell for their own lies i

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,160
mean they've been in in ukraine's

219
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
networks for such a long time they

220
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
should know the region they should know

221
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
how the people work but they keep

222
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
repeating their own lies saying that

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
ukraine is not a proper nation uh they

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,319
will welcome russians once we get there

225
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
um it will be so easy to take here

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
within a couple of days and as i said i

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,599
cannot help but wonder whether putin in

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
his establishment and it's probably very

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
hard to tell because we don't have an

230
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
insight into his inner circle but to

231
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
what extent they fell for their own lies

232
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,120
and that surprised me the most that uh

233
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
they haven't

234
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
been prepared better

235
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
or they're prepared or they had the

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
strategy for the or they had the wrong

237
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
strategy of a quick win

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
and in terms of strategy paul you're the

239
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,839
expert on strategy what's what's your

240
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
take on the miscalculation dimension

241
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
here

242
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
yeah and i'll take it from the

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
geopolitics side and and thank you very

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
much for the invitation by the way um

245
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
and and probably is the nature of

246
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,399
conflict that has uh uh made uh the most

247
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
was taken most of my time in terms of

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
researching about the conflict and of

249
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
course the cyber warfare preceded the

250
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,839
actual war and we had been studying

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,680
about the evolving nature of conflict

252
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
for a long time

253
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
particularly in the 90s and the 2000s

254
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,279
when we thought that that what mattered

255
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,440
was the erosion of the boundaries of

256
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,360
conflict in international affairs right

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
we had studied for so long and

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,560
maricaldor's new wars book was perhaps

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
the the clearest example of that how uh

260
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,720
warring parties were were blurring how

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,560
uh civilians were the main target how um

262
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
ethnic reasons behind the conflict were

263
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,760
on the rise

264
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,640
how socioeconomic conditions were also

265
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
what the roots of the of the conflict

266
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
and basically what we've come up to

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,680
realize is that we are back to very um

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
traditional

269
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
forms of waging war but also very

270
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
traditional reasoning behind the war

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
that we are witnessing now and probably

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
i would say

273
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
that what we are witnessing today is the

274
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
comeback of geopolitics in conflict and

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
i would say even worse than that the

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,399
combination of uh this uh eroding

277
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
boundaries of conflict that we have been

278
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,680
working on for the last decades combined

279
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
with geopolitics and probably what we

280
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,279
are witnessing today is the worst of

281
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,760
both worlds the conflict is being eroded

282
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
there are multiple sources of conflict

283
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
multiple reasonings force for for

284
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,160
conflict multiple ways of waging war

285
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
from cyber to actual war but in addition

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
to that with an upper layer of

287
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
geopolitical dimension of the conflict

288
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
that i think that when we look back in

289
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
in time to the ukraine war um we will uh

290
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
put this war as the as the the beginning

291
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
of a new era hopefully it will be an

292
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,959
exception to what's uh to come but i

293
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
really hope so in historical terms but

294
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
for the time being we have to be very

295
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
careful on the combination of these

296
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
eroding boundaries of conflict and the

297
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,839
geopoliticization

298
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,320
sorry for the long word of conflict

299
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
so let's take this thesis of the return

300
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
of the traditional war and and wrap it

301
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
around a little bit on the on the panel

302
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
some observers in the cypress scholar

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,560
community they they said okay maybe one

304
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
of the explanations for the lack of

305
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
cyber activity or rather destructive

306
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
cyber activity in terms of conventional

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
or physical effects

308
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
is the pure fact that you can do the

309
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
same stuff with rockets but way cheaper

310
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
and may way more effective so the return

311
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
of the conventional weapon superior to

312
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,079
the cyber dimension

313
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
would uh eva maybe

314
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
what's your thought on this is it return

315
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
of the traditional or should we go back

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
to traditional analog tanks or does the

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
cyborg digital dimension still has a

318
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
role to play

319
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
well i think it's inseparable and i

320
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
actually wouldn't also rush maybe to

321
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
judge

322
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
because there is a real war going on in

323
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,399
in on the grounds and i i i imagine it's

324
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
really hard to ask ukrainians to provide

325
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,360
us an assist assessment of how they are

326
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
doing and what's going on because i

327
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
think they really are fighting a real

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
life for for life so uh

329
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
i think uh i wouldn't agree that there

330
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,399
haven't been attempts we have seen that

331
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,600
they try to

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
crash communication

333
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,800
you know that's where we have the famous

334
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,760
elon musk stepping in with starlings

335
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,079
we've seen that they tried to get into

336
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,480
electrical grids so it's clearly there

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
were attempts so i think there's no

338
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
it's clear that digital is therefore to

339
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,720
stay and the cyber attacks and sort of a

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,279
domain as a vote for war

341
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,000
uh it will stay so it's it's just a

342
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,880
question

343
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
whether we will be whether we will learn

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,480
fast and whether we will advance our

345
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
ourselves from that learning from this

346
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,160
conflict uh much quicker in this sort of

347
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,040
horizontal way uh between all the all

348
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
the democratic countries the format's

349
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,120
been mentioned couple of times i also

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
want to mention we have this initiative

351
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
under president biden to have a

352
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
democracy summit i think which is again

353
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,240
bringing together those countries

354
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,079
who stand by certain

355
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,639
values and want to defend them also in

356
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
the digital domain so i think

357
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
the threats are there to stay the

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
question is will we be better prepared

359
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
to stand uh stand as good as we do it

360
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
now

361
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,810
at least as good as we do it now

362
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,959
[Music]

363
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,440
yes certainly and we cannot completely

364
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
rule out that in the future we might

365
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
face an antagonist who is a little bit

366
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,959
more competent of you know integrating

367
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
cyber and and conventional military

368
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,360
capabilities so we cannot rule this out

369
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,480
completely

370
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
um speaking of failures a little bit

371
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
more some observers argued

372
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,040
that the russians lost the information

373
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
war quite early on you know winning the

374
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,480
hearts and mind because the

375
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,399
international community or at least as

376
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
it seemed from our western perspective

377
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,440
was quickly uh aligned with ukraine and

378
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
the messages coming out of kiev of

379
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
president zielinski on with his social

380
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
media feeds and his smartphones

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,839
debunking lies and misinformation and

382
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
disinformation and being pretty active

383
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
in the meme space you probably heard

384
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,800
about legend stories of snake island

385
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,000
you've seen the the warship uh

386
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
stamp that has been printed which is all

387
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
strategic communication

388
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
what's your assessment on the

389
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
information angle did russia lose the

390
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
information war or is it just a faulty

391
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,639
perspective because we were not the

392
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,000
target

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
i think it's it's a bit too early to

394
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,839
tell but i don't think that there are

395
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,839
real winners in the site and as you said

396
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
the right term to use is

397
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
from our perspective because we all live

398
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,000
in our own bubbles and we get those

399
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,440
media that are mostly tailored to us

400
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,320
um

401
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
so from our western perspective looking

402
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,240
at zelinski the charismatic leader

403
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
in his green t-shirt uh streamlining out

404
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
of ukraine kiev

405
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,760
that certainly gave us a very good

406
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
impression

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
he did a great job

408
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,839
on this side he was winning but i would

409
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,800
i would

410
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
if if we look towards russia for

411
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,040
instance i think the the picture is very

412
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,519
different it's very bleak because russia

413
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
has uh stepped up on uh state censorship

414
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,320
so everything all independent media that

415
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,120
were still left uh they are basically

416
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,759
banned and you cannot talk about the war

417
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
other than in in putin's own

418
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,240
or the government line so i would say

419
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,759
for the russian people i mean they

420
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,680
depends again on the perspective the

421
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,279
russians are losing out because they

422
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,600
only get their own perspective but here

423
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,639
putin

424
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
thus far is rather successful because

425
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
he's only selling his lies

426
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
to his own people

427
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
i would say that there was also a very

428
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
interesting um

429
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
development on the international level

430
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
that we could observe in this conflict

431
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
and that goes to your point also about

432
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,480
international collaboration so prior to

433
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,000
the war we had a really unprecedented

434
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,839
effort by the us government to make

435
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,120
public

436
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
intelligence and declassify intelligence

437
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
in order to share it with the world and

438
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
thus frustrate russia's narrative of

439
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
being the victims in this war here and

440
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
they just had to defend themselves and

441
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
that's something that is really

442
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,079
interesting to watch because it's taking

443
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,959
this information warfare to a global

444
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,240
level

445
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
it's too early to speak of something

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,279
like a information world war but i think

447
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
we're seeing a really a dynamic here and

448
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,120
you also mentioned a similar point that

449
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,680
the war it's not contained in ukraine

450
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,639
but it's spreading across the borders

451
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,759
and it depends very much on in which

452
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,440
kind of bubble you are what you're

453
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
seeing but it's uh yeah it's taking on a

454
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
very international dynamic and i think

455
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
that we will see a lot more of this

456
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
type of or we need to see a lot more of

457
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,319
this type of cooperation and

458
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
intelligence sharing and also

459
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
declassifying intelligence to make it

460
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,520
public

461
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,039
um to

462
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,319
yeah give transparency in order to

463
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,839
address this russian disinformation

464
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
we come to strategies for tackling this

465
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
information in a while but let's go back

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
to the geopolitics and strategy and

467
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,200
higher level questions

468
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
security experts say that we have

469
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,360
entered a new phase of competition with

470
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,840
russia we in germany we liked the idea

471
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
that we could build a cooperative

472
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
security architecture together with

473
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,600
russia and this whole architecture

474
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
crumbled with the invasion the latest of

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
course there were signs earlier georgia

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
2008 crimea 2014 so as i mentioned we're

477
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,080
a little bit late to the game but

478
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
we are in the face of a new security

479
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
architecture that is that is evolving

480
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
that is to be more antagonistic rather

481
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,880
than cooperative

482
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
so how do you think called this security

483
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
this new security architecture that is

484
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,440
being developed right now will play out

485
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
and what

486
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
what what the cyber dimension will play

487
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
in this or what role the cyber dimension

488
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,160
will play in this architecture it's a

489
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,679
broad question three quick points on

490
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,600
this that i think are quite important

491
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
first of all the the acknowledgement

492
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,919
that what used to unite us now is

493
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,520
tearing us apart

494
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,679
right and and and that i think is quite

495
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,480
crucial to understand why this war is

496
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
being waged so in the idea

497
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
that there is a return

498
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
to

499
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
is everything all right well there was a

500
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
small mouse for those of you who

501
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,640
couldn't see it

502
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
okay

503
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
okay okay um

504
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,480
since i am facing you i didn't see it

505
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
please so let me let me go back to the

506
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,559
idea now it will be very difficult to

507
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,720
catch people's attention but i will i

508
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
will i will do my best um so i was

509
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,720
saying what used to um uh unite us and

510
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
now it's tearing us apart and that means

511
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
that we are uh being confronted in the

512
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
in the city in this world now to a clear

513
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,679
return of power dynamics at the

514
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,600
international scene combined with

515
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,960
interconnectedness right so you cannot

516
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,559
understand one without the other it's

517
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,960
both playing uh at the same time and the

518
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,400
long standing assumptions that we had on

519
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,559
uh economic cooperation energy

520
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
cooperation inclusion inclusion within

521
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,919
the

522
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
rules-based order and so on are

523
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,679
precisely

524
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,039
denied by the fact that power politics

525
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,679
overcomes everything that we are

526
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
witnessing now so this is my my first

527
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,799
point and here um connectivity of course

528
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,840
is part of of the geopolitical

529
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,919
game second point on the geopolitical

530
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
confrontation

531
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,679
then what we are seeing is that every

532
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,919
tool including technology including

533
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
cyber is used for geopolitical purposes

534
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,679
so every actor who wants to be a

535
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
geopolitical actor

536
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
has to equip itself with

537
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,159
the a broad range of tools that go way

538
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,120
beyond its regulatory power for instance

539
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,559
and that is the case for the european

540
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,440
union very strong regulatory power but

541
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
not enough in this geopolitical

542
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
competition and there's usually a

543
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,480
parallel mate here between regulating by

544
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,679
the eu in technology iraq and regulating

545
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,320
the single market well listen single

546
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,520
market was also about capabilities you

547
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,000
had the industries you had the economy

548
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
to rule for the rest of the world in the

549
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
digital domain in the technological

550
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
domain you also need to build

551
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,159
capabilities you also need to build

552
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,799
innovation practices r d european

553
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
digital champions there are many more

554
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
things than regulatory power that i

555
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
think go together if you want to be a

556
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,799
geopolitical actor and third and very

557
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,480
quick i think that the debates on

558
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
security um today are very tangible they

559
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,159
are not theoretical anymore they are not

560
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
about conceptions on security they are

561
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
not conceptions about the world we live

562
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
in their conceptions about the way to

563
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,919
tackle shared security concerns problems

564
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,039
and threats and then concepts that

565
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,360
emanated from these more theoretical

566
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
understandings of security in europe

567
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
such as strategic autonomy for instance

568
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,640
have become very tangible as well and

569
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
they are based on the idea that you need

570
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
to cooperate and you need to be

571
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,840
complementary to what others are doing

572
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
if you want to secure your place and

573
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,880
when i'm in your place i mean the

574
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
european union's place in this more

575
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,159
geopolitical uh contest

576
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,960
thank you so much despina i i think you

577
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
might want to respond to that because

578
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
there was a lot put on the table

579
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
regarding how do we do or what what do

580
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
we do with actors who don't believe in

581
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
the rules based orders the european

582
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
union does believe in the rules-based

583
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
order very much its whole cyber

584
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
diplomacy is based on this concept so

585
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
what's your reply to paul in this

586
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,159
assessment

587
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,919
first of all i'm very amused by the

588
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,760
little friend that joined us in the room

589
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
i think

590
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
europe is known for having been built on

591
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
norms and

592
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,080
laws we started as an internal market

593
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,159
but internal market represent value so

594
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,919
the whole of the eu represents the value

595
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
of peace

596
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,559
and security and we defend our values

597
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,640
with laws this is the approach we have

598
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
taken

599
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,159
and we have been evolving in our laws

600
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,039
and i would not call the nis technical

601
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,960
standards i mean i would call the nis

602
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
fundamental because it is a piece of

603
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
legislation and as you know it is

604
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,159
currently being in the negotiation table

605
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,760
for updates

606
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,679
that ensures that all critical

607
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,120
infrastructure

608
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,919
meets high cyber security standards

609
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,679
that's not technical

610
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,520
that's strategic

611
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,440
and we have moved from the current law

612
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
that says you protect your usual

613
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
critical infrastructures your energy

614
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,720
sector banking financial health etc

615
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,000
transport

616
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
to also some industries and imagine we

617
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,159
designed this proposal before covet hit

618
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
and of course healthcare medical devices

619
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,240
are all in there

620
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,159
food industry is in there so all the

621
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,600
industries that are critical for the

622
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
operation of our society it's as if we

623
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,520
knew the crisis that hit us the last two

624
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,080
years were coming because if they stop

625
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,559
operating then we have a problem

626
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,240
and we matched this with an ambition to

627
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
become more operational in europe we

628
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,520
worked a lot on preparedness on

629
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,320
resilience with the nis with our laws on

630
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,960
certification et cetera but we have also

631
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
committed in the new commission and this

632
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
was a commitment of president vanderlian

633
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,919
already at the very beginning of the

634
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
monday to create a so-called joint cyber

635
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,360
unit that is still under discussion but

636
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
this shows our approach of becoming more

637
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,559
operational

638
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,120
we need to make sure we join forces we

639
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
join all our

640
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,760
energy and powers that we have as 27

641
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,000
member states with one cybersecurity

642
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,279
policy

643
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,279
and the question is how

644
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,360
we have had a number of discussions by

645
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
ministers and a technical level that

646
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
show it is difficult to gain enough

647
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,840
trust for people to say if you face a

648
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,799
cyber attack you can take my guys and

649
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,120
they can come to help you and fix it

650
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
that happens at some level with some

651
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
countries at the bilateral understanding

652
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,320
we wanted to create if you like a

653
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,799
reserve list of cyber security

654
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,720
professionals that in case of a big

655
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
cross-border attack would be able to

656
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
help each other the problem is that

657
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
which member state that is suffering

658
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,120
will want to lend to another one their

659
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,039
forces and we know that there is great

660
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,760
inequalities between member states

661
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
when it comes to cyber security experts

662
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,559
and an overall problem of skill shortage

663
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
in the field especially in the public

664
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
administration because it doesn't pay as

665
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
much as the private sector let's let's

666
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,480
be frank

667
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,559
so this is why we're now reflecting how

668
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,080
to create this

669
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
reserve if you like how can we create in

670
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
europe this solidarity approach that we

671
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,679
demonstrated also in this war on the

672
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
operational side this is what we're

673
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,440
missing we have the legal framework we

674
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,760
have the diplomacy toolbox it didn't

675
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,880
lead us very far in this case we have a

676
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,039
sanctions regime for cyber security but

677
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,919
their attribution makes it very hard to

678
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,679
implement because it's difficult to

679
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,919
agree on attribution attribution on its

680
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,840
own is very difficult

681
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,159
and now we need some operational we need

682
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,960
to move to what we call cyber defense

683
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,200
because in europe we we took an approach

684
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,679
until now that distinguished something

685
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,520
that in my view is undistinguished and

686
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
distinguishable

687
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,559
civilian and uh defense cyber security

688
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,240
it is now time to see how the two can

689
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
work together

690
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,440
right okay so some people argue that we

691
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,760
in the european union have or no not

692
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
even in the european union but maybe

693
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
within the western alliance in general

694
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,000
have a strategic gap regarding gray zone

695
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,679
activity because

696
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
or activity below the conventional

697
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,679
threshold of an armed attack which is

698
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,440
the legal threshold

699
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,919
for nato's article 5 to be triggered as

700
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,159
a response for example for a devastating

701
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,159
cyber attack or even the european union

702
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,320
solidarity clause might come in in this

703
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
regard but the problem is that most of

704
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
the activities that we see in the cyber

705
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,919
domain stays below this threshold of

706
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,919
activity what we have in the european

707
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,760
union is the cyber diplomacy toolbox

708
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
which which also includes restrictive

709
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,919
measures such as sanctions and we used

710
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,640
these

711
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,279
these sanctions in the past against apt

712
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,200
28 and 29 and sanctions sanction

713
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
put some restriction travel bans and

714
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,720
some asset freezes on some russian

715
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,799
operatives the question is if they feel

716
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
really threatened by that if they cannot

717
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,840
come to the european union anymore

718
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,279
so some people argue that this is not

719
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,960
enough to fill the gap

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
that is below the threshold of an armed

721
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,440
attack but still higher than than what

722
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
these restrictive measures try to

723
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,760
achieve

724
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,400
to order or maybe to to create some sort

725
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
of deterrence and a question maybe to

726
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,400
all of you do you agree with this

727
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,159
assessment that we have this strategic

728
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,919
gap or is it just you know

729
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,240
armed armchair strategist discussion in

730
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,320
the academic journals

731
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,679
maybe there's been

732
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,840
you

733
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
um

734
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
well um i i don't want to

735
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,960
to speak all the time myself i think

736
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,840
that

737
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,559
there is a gap

738
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,159
also because of different approaches

739
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,159
across the world

740
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,640
again i mentioned europe in the u.s we

741
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,279
saw a fantastic race

742
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,919
to create standards after the colonial

743
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,720
pipeline incident and now we have uh

744
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
directive after directive on

745
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,799
reporting incidents something that in

746
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,399
europe we did with the ni's directive

747
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,600
already

748
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
five years ago

749
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,320
i think

750
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,559
now people are there is a certain

751
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,880
convergence that is coming up in the

752
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
approaches and i think that convergence

753
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
could be achieved with what i mentioned

754
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,679
earlier more collaboration and there we

755
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,480
will reach this strategic

756
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,799
we will cover the strategic gap that you

757
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,799
mentioned

758
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,720
i think i i i'm coming from a small

759
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
state living in a dangerous sort of

760
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
geographical location i think where

761
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,720
there is a will there is a way so i

762
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,039
don't think that we are in such a sort

763
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
of a gap i think actually if there is a

764
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,039
will and that will if we can if we can

765
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,120
put together that will

766
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
as minimum between two coasts of

767
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,080
atlantic ocean and we stop quarreling

768
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
between ourselves about some minor

769
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
issues i think if there's one thing

770
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,640
another one thing that the ukraine the

771
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
war in ukraine has done i think good in

772
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
the sense that it has

773
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
put aside all kind of little things and

774
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,399
brought a bigger perspective back on the

775
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,039
table that we actually share more that

776
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,559
we argue about more so i think i don't i

777
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,039
don't see that as as a disadvantage i

778
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,840
think we have a lot opportunities to do

779
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,679
i think we do need that regulation

780
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,520
because that's just the way of how

781
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,279
democratic countries cooperate and

782
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,120
operate and we have all these

783
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,039
regulations in pipeline

784
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,919
we saw i think one very small example

785
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,799
digital single digital service act

786
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,360
i think the last minute change is the

787
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,159
conflict situation will be added in so

788
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,240
that there is a possibility to react

789
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
quickly if necessary because

790
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,279
technologies evolve conflicts change and

791
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,080
we have to have tools and legal means to

792
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,559
operate so we have these capacities uh

793
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,880
sort of from uh from from legal

794
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,039
perspective and i think we also have

795
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,880
finances so we

796
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
europe set a course to invest a lot in

797
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
digital development what i would like to

798
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,240
see it said i think from recovery fund

799
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,520
it was 20

800
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,039
of that whole money should go into

801
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,000
digital so i really hope that now these

802
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
digital investments will also have

803
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,640
almost like a mandatory percentage that

804
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
anything that you build digitally has to

805
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,000
have i don't know 10 15 percent costs

806
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,880
invested in security because we should

807
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
start like the question is how do we

808
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,600
integrate that security in everyday

809
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,080
digital solutions that kept that keep up

810
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,399
coming and building we have to make it

811
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,440
much stronger effort that security is

812
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,080
part so i'm i'm rather optimistic i

813
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,600
think that we have all tools on table

814
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,120
financial uh legal and i think we have

815
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,000
really uh motivation if we don't have an

816
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,640
incentive right now looking at ukraine

817
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
uh what's going on when else at both

818
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
both coasts at least of atlantic or

819
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
among democratic community we would be

820
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
able to actually really get our will

821
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
together to act

822
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
so caroline and paul do you share this

823
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
optimism that we that we might fill this

824
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,039
gap

825
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
um

826
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,720
to go back to your the question you said

827
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
before um

828
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,640
in 2019 uh the german then chief of

829
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,039
defense for the cyber information domain

830
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,600
general leinhaus he said that in germany

831
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,519
we would need something which he called

832
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,000
a digital state of defense

833
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,399
and i found this a really good

834
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,679
suggestion

835
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,840
i'm not saying that i'm for it there are

836
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
pros and cons

837
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
some people would say it's absolutely

838
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,240
necessary some people say well we don't

839
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
need it but the point is it was

840
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,519
it was not a debate in germany no one

841
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,919
discussed it and if you google it it has

842
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,519
a a hit

843
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,880
i maybe

844
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,559
20 30

845
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,360
too

846
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,080
i don't know um but i was really

847
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,320
surprised no one picked it up no one

848
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
really reported on it and after a while

849
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,519
it just everyone forgot it and the

850
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,360
reason why i think we need this debate

851
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,519
and why we should at least discuss the

852
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,159
possibility is so when the war in

853
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,919
ukraine started

854
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,480
i talked to a friend of mine with whom i

855
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,559
attended school and she's not in this

856
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,200
security business and she said she told

857
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,399
me i was living in my pink world and i

858
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,039
woke up and and it was it was awful i

859
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,840
did not expect this how did it come to

860
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,640
that

861
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,039
and what i think digital state of

862
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,000
defense would do at least it would raise

863
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,279
awareness among germans that we are we

864
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,200
are under attack even if we're not

865
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
attacked by armed force there are forces

866
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,880
that are trying to dissect our society

867
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
to to dissect the fabrics of our society

868
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,080
i mean there are there are families in

869
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,440
germany that they who have russian

870
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
russian background and they discuss the

871
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,480
question of who is right is russia right

872
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,960
is russia has russia been a victim is

873
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,159
ukraine a victim and i think this entire

874
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,640
uh contested information space that we

875
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,279
have that has become so toxic

876
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,320
uh with this information i think we need

877
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
much better awareness at least in

878
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,080
germany i think it's it's very different

879
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
in in the eastern european uh

880
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,679
nations they have a much better threat

881
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,760
assessment but in germany at least i

882
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
think it would uh it wouldn't be bad uh

883
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
to follow up uh olaf schultz's titan

884
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,799
vendor and to at least discuss

885
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,279
mechanisms that are below the threshold

886
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,159
of a state of defense and that would

887
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,480
allow us to to defend ourselves much

888
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,840
better against this malign influence

889
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,279
yeah and whether i am optimistic or or

890
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,559
not on

891
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,960
on on threat perception strategic uh

892
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
threat perception well the traditional

893
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,559
gap uh

894
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,080
i think has been

895
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,640
not closed but narrowed when it comes to

896
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,559
the understanding of

897
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,519
what ukraine means for the whole of

898
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,039
europe and speaking from a spanish

899
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,640
perspective of course

900
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,320
um the spanish ministry of foreign

901
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,120
affairs like to likes to say that uh at

902
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,960
the time when the russians realized that

903
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,120
a country that is far away that tends to

904
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
see the conflicts in the east that's not

905
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,719
affecting direct security to spain and

906
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,399
also that is traditionally um

907
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,800
or that acknowledges the need to speak

908
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,199
to russia uh because it's a big power

909
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,359
well at the moment that spain was taking

910
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,760
the risk seriously and what that was

911
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
being one of the first countries to be

912
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,918
very proactive in the eu response then

913
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
that helped

914
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,520
also in the eyes of russia to see that

915
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,918
this was serious this is what uh what

916
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,119
the ministry uh likes to say and be that

917
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,239
true or not we will study it in in a few

918
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,280
years time um what is certainly

919
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
the case is that for the time being and

920
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,159
as we speak this strategic gap this

921
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,480
threat perception has narrowed

922
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,839
across europe and that is a positive

923
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,239
sign it is an optimistic

924
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,240
view but however

925
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
when it comes to the long-standing

926
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,400
trends in eu foreign policy and the

927
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
strategy of the european union we're

928
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,079
still suffering more or less from the

929
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,880
same ills that we have had over the time

930
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,800
right now we are in extraordinary

931
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
circumstances and we've acted fast and

932
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
coherently

933
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,680
but the truth is that the coherence of

934
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
the different stools tools that we have

935
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
at our external action domain and that

936
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,960
includes cyber but includes military and

937
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
includes development cooperation and

938
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
includes energy and eight all the

939
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,800
policies that you can name

940
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,880
of course the coherence is still low

941
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,960
it's very difficult to bring them

942
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,480
together under a same strategic

943
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,680
direction

944
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,480
second the alignment of interests

945
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,119
is still the visitor i mean it's still

946
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,200
very different when you speak to a

947
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,440
german audience than when you speak to a

948
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,280
spanish audience right and when it comes

949
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
to energy links when it comes to

950
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,480
many aspects so these um these these

951
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,200
interests will disalign or will continue

952
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,440
to disalign because they have always

953
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,520
been different and third uh when it

954
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,720
comes to policy making uh mechanisms and

955
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,359
and institutional arrangements we are

956
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,200
still very much

957
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,839
limited by the way we take decisions at

958
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
the eu level when it comes to foreign

959
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,400
policy defense matters and now we

960
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
like to say that

961
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,119
qualified majority avoiding qmv debates

962
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,880
are gone because we could adopt

963
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,920
sanctions with unanimity and that of

964
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
course this discussion is not relevant

965
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,200
anymore

966
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,280
well i would be cautious with that

967
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,560
reading because when these interests

968
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,200
start to disalign again and they are by

969
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,079
the way starting to disalign already as

970
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,960
we speak with uh the position of polar

971
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,280
poland and and bulgaria for instance or

972
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,119
the position of other countries when it

973
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,160
comes to the energy uh to

974
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
these interests are starting to disalign

975
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,280
so qmv discussions and and the

976
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,760
limitations of unanimity will come back

977
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,800
as soon

978
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
as this first

979
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,920
strategic alignment that we are

980
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
witnessing now

981
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
starts to vanishes or start starts to to

982
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,520
be endangered

983
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,599
yeah and we can be pretty sure that

984
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,359
antagonistic actors

985
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,119
will try to uh

986
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,680
fracture this this creation even more in

987
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
the long run so we have just like five

988
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,560
more minutes left and and i will end the

989
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,640
panel with the question that was the

990
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,800
topic on the the panel which is the

991
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
question how will geopolitics oh there's

992
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
the mouth again how will geopolitics

993
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,760
reshape the cyber environment and i just

994
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,599
want to go over to the spina once more

995
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,480
what are like the two or maybe three

996
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
main mechanisms how you see the

997
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,920
relationship of geopolitics and the

998
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
cyber dimension evolving in the future

999
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,040
the three causal mechanisms or the three

1000
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
ways in which geopolitics and and the

1001
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
cyber dimension will change in the

1002
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
future

1003
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
yes what i mean

1004
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,720
your question was

1005
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
how will

1006
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,400
geopolitics reshape cyberspace i think

1007
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,240
it also works the other way around

1008
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,359
your power in cyberspace will also

1009
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,680
determine a lot of the geopolitics i

1010
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,359
don't think it is a coincidence that not

1011
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,520
that long ago russia had engaged in an

1012
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,839
exercise to disconnect itself from the

1013
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,040
internet and to have a self-standing uh

1014
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
system

1015
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,160
so i think

1016
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
the main factors

1017
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,640
will

1018
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,119
depend on how of course each power

1019
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,839
decides to invest in cyber security

1020
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,480
investment in money is one area

1021
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,119
uh traditionally for instance in the

1022
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,440
other side of the of the atlantic it was

1023
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
defense that was investing in cyber

1024
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
security and therefore we saw very big

1025
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
investments in europe we take a more

1026
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,599
fragmented approach i think if

1027
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,680
investment grows and if we link more to

1028
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,960
defense definitely there we will see a

1029
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,280
bigger geopolitical game

1030
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,119
joining forces as i mentioned for the

1031
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,880
like-minded i think that will be a

1032
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,440
determining power

1033
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,119
geopolitically speaking

1034
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,359
again those that want the good of the

1035
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,720
world

1036
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,760
and want to defend what others malicious

1037
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,599
actors may want to do

1038
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,680
and of course maintaining and enhancing

1039
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,880
our laws

1040
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,440
in europe we do not intend to stop

1041
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
we have this fantastic capacity of 27

1042
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,040
countries thinking in one mind and going

1043
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,079
with one approach we intend to invest in

1044
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,680
resilience more you know that we are

1045
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
currently consulting until the 25th of

1046
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,720
may on the cyber resilience act and

1047
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,119
we're very open as to what that may mean

1048
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
the cyber resilience we're trying to

1049
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,440
achieve security by design starting from

1050
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,599
product services and going where have

1051
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,440
you and i think that will largely depend

1052
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
on what responses we get

1053
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,240
investing on more operational again this

1054
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,760
is the next step where we see europe

1055
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,240
creating forces that can help in case of

1056
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,200
cyber attack so managing cyber attacks

1057
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,480
and response

1058
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,599
by

1059
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,560
joint public-private partnerships maybe

1060
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,520
and why not also transatlantic or more

1061
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,680
global relations and alliances

1062
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,280
you have an extreme

1063
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,880
uh yeah i'm thinking in a global global

1064
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,280
global terms i think what covi did we

1065
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
sort of we kind of moved from one global

1066
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,760
crisis health crisis into sort of a new

1067
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,839
one and i thought the war is

1068
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,079
geographically kind of limited it's uh

1069
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,240
it's russia attacking or invading

1070
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
ukraine but the conflict we have a

1071
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,520
global uh in terms of is russia between

1072
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
at least between democratic states so we

1073
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
kind of what we've seen that kovid

1074
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,000
accelerated the digitization it was kind

1075
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,960
of a side effect of of kovid i think

1076
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
what we but i think will come from this

1077
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,920
war as a side effect that we will see

1078
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,280
acceleration of cyber security and uh in

1079
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,599
and it will have many forms and ways but

1080
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,760
i'm i'm very confident that it that's

1081
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,119
what will happen we'll see more

1082
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,960
investments will

1083
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,440
we might see more regulations standards

1084
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,839
i mean anything that helps i also

1085
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,079
looking forward to see that a business

1086
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,720
market in itself sees an opportunity to

1087
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,040
develop new products and there is a

1088
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,599
potential for business and profit

1089
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,040
as sort of the general awareness of of

1090
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,760
cyber threat and risk has i think

1091
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
tremendously gone up

1092
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,000
so i think with cyber security i i'm

1093
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
more optimistic i think we have we see

1094
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,440
what needs to be done and i think it

1095
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,839
will be accelerated i think information

1096
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,160
space is more complicated topic and i

1097
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,599
think that

1098
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,200
i hope will open more creative more

1099
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,160
honest uh discussions on what to do with

1100
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,119
this information space i think that

1101
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,319
field

1102
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,720
i see i don't see the answers yet i see

1103
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,119
that the questions are big and bold but

1104
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,920
we don't have answers comparing to cyber

1105
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,040
security

1106
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,200
but for answers we have caroline so

1107
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,119
no problem thank you

1108
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,400
um yeah how do we rebuild trust uh after

1109
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,560
it's been shattered i mean trust is

1110
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,800
obviously it's at a low point right now

1111
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,920
between

1112
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,599
let's say the west and

1113
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,920
and russia and to some extent china on

1114
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,960
the other hand but in the in the apps

1115
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,400
well while we won't rebuild trust now um

1116
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,760
between those sites um but what we can

1117
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,640
do is do our homework and and that's

1118
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,240
what i think we we need to get better at

1119
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,399
and

1120
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,520
and there there are a couple of things

1121
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,359
that we can do i mean

1122
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,240
russia is pursuing obviously a long-term

1123
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,200
strategy and the most obvious answer is

1124
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,000
also a long-term strategy to namely

1125
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,200
invest more in education and

1126
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
also digital education i don't know

1127
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
about other nations they are probably

1128
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,240
more advanced but in germany at least we

1129
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,240
can improve digital education a lot more

1130
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,160
teach our children that

1131
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,319
the internet is a contested space and

1132
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,480
that not everything that they see is

1133
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,680
correct

1134
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,640
in fact

1135
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,960
the opposite and then also i think we

1136
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,720
should invest more in analysis

1137
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,599
capabilities and that's where i see some

1138
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,920
interesting trends because a couple of

1139
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,359
years ago

1140
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,839
when the military discovered uh social

1141
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,640
media for for instance situation

1142
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,119
awareness there were a lot of companies

1143
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,480
who were able to provide such services

1144
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,880
and who were able to analyze social

1145
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,920
media do data mining all that type of

1146
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,640
things and a lot of them

1147
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,880
back then it wasn't really i would say

1148
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,119
it wasn't really sexy and a lot of them

1149
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,520
were discredited by scandals like

1150
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
cambridge analytica where we saw

1151
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,359
election meddling

1152
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,040
and a lot of them didn't really want to

1153
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,240
go public

1154
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,839
right now i kind of have the feeling

1155
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,560
that a lot of companies are saying yeah

1156
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
of course we need to analyze social

1157
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,480
media because we need to detect this

1158
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,920
information we're doing uh societies a

1159
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,280
service because

1160
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,839
we're not interested in

1161
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,440
earlier we talked about privacy we're

1162
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,119
not interested in the individual but

1163
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
we're interested in tracking

1164
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,599
disinformation and

1165
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,000
and shedding a light on this so i think

1166
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,760
that's something where

1167
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
we also have a lot of work to do

1168
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,520
excellent paul super quick because we're

1169
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,960
eating away people's coffee break and

1170
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,040
the people look decaffeinated time is up

1171
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,640
and and i'll be very brief to answer to

1172
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,800
your question with three c's that i

1173
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
think are very important

1174
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
