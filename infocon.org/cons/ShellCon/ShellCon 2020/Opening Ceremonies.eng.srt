we couldn't have done this without the

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,800
amazing community that we've built up

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
over the last four years

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,720
here's a quick orientation on the events

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,320
that we have going on this year

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,000

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,359
the discord so make sure that you follow

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,119
